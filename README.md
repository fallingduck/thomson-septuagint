> This is the first translation of the Septuagint into English. He [Charles

> a part of the Septuagint at an auction in this city [Philadelphia].

> He had bought it for a mere trifle, and without knowing what it was, save
> that the Crier said it was outlandish letters. When he had mastered it enough
> to understand it, his anxiety became great to see the whole; but he could
> find no copy. Strange to tell, in the interval of two years, passing the same
> store, and chancing to look in, he saw there the remainder actually crying
> off for a few pence, and he bought it!

> I used to tell him that the translation which he afterwards made should have
> had these facts set at the front of the work as a Preface; for that great
> work, the first of the kind in the English language, strangely enough, was
> ushered into the world without any preface.

Although, as stated above, Thomson himself gave very little information
regarding the background of his historic translation, including what Greek
source text he used, S.F. Pells states in the introduction to his 1904
reprinting that the translation matches the Greek of the Vatican Text.

The Vatican Text which Thomson purchased would have been an edition (apparently
in two volumes) based on the Roman Septuagint commissioned by Pope Sixtus V.
There were many such editions (although volume count varied) printed in the
17th and early 18th centuries which could have found their way into a shop in
Philadelphia by the second half of the 18th century (Thomson himself spent 19
years on his translation). Perhaps most noteworthy of these printings is the
1709 Frankfurt *Vetus Testamentum, Ex Versione lxx. Interpretum* printed as
four books in two volumes by Lambert Bos.

The text of the *Codex Vaticanus* (identified with siglum **B**) is dated to
the first half of the 4th century AD.

The English text itself has become relegated to obscurity, almost entirely
superseded by Sir Lancelot C.L. Brenton's 1844 *Septuagint Version in English*,
though saved from oblivion perhaps only by the 1904 reprinting of S.F. Pells
(on a facsimile of which this new electronic transcription is based), and the
1954 revision by C.A. Muses, which, according to some, is too influenced by the
Masoretic Hebrew to be a good representation of the Greek text.

Thomson's translation, however, was considered faithful and of scholarly value,
and was consulted by the scholars who worked on the English Revised Version,
the Old Testament of which was published in 1885.

Although several incomplete or rough electronic versions of the text exist
(exhibits [A](http://thetencommandmentsministry.us/ministry/charles_thomson/)
and [B](http://studybible.info/Thomson)), this is the first one which attempts
to accurately reproduce a proofed transcription, formatted according to the
original work, and with proper versification, in the standard electronic
formats for the printing and electronic publishing of Scripture (USFM and
OSIS).

## Contributing

We welcome contributors to this project who wish to assist in the creation and
proofing of the USFM files (from the OCR versions of the two volumes found in
the [./ocr/ directory](ocr/)), which should ultimately correspond with versing
of the King James Version, and the layout of the 1904 printing (found in
volumes [1](https://archive.org/stream/oldcovenantcommo01thom) and
[2](https://archive.org/stream/oldcovenantcommo02thom) on the Internet
Archive).

Additionally, proofreading of the completed books, including for typos,
formatting, and versification, is greatly appreciated. Submit a pull request or
open an issue! Every fix, even if it's just one letter, counts!
