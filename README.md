Thomson used as his source text the so-called *Cambridge Septuagint*, printed
at Cambridge in 1665 by John Field. This was an edition of the Roman
Septuagint, which was originally commissioned by Pope Sixtus V, and was
published in 1587. It reproduced the text of the *Vatican Codex* (the uncial
manuscript identified with siglum **B**), which is a very early manuscript,
dated to the first half of the 4th century AD. Thomson labored on his
*Holy Bible* for 19 years, and published the translation in 1808.

The English text itself has become relegated to obscurity, almost entirely
superseded by Sir Lancelot C.L. Brenton's 1844 *Septuagint Version in English*,
though saved from oblivion perhaps only by the 1904 reprinting of S.F. Pells
(on a facsimile of which this new electronic transcription is based), and the
1954 revision by C.A. Muses, which, according to some, is too influenced by the
Masoretic Hebrew to be a good representation of the Greek text.

Thomson's translation, however, despite its relative obscurity, was considered
faithful and of scholarly value, and was consulted by the scholars who worked
on the English Revised Version, the Old Testament of which was published in
1885. Being the first English translation of the Greek Old Testament and the
first Bible translated in the United States, it remains an under-appreciated
work of historical and spiritual value in the present day.

Although several incomplete or rough electronic versions of the text exist
(exhibits [A](http://thetencommandmentsministry.us/ministry/charles_thomson/)
and [B](http://studybible.info/Thomson)), this is the first one which attempts
to accurately reproduce a proofed transcription, formatted according to the
original work, and with proper versification, in the standard electronic
formats for the printing and electronic publishing of Scripture (USFM and
OSIS).

## Contributing

We welcome contributors to this project who wish to assist in the creation and
proofing of the USFM files (from the OCR versions of the two volumes found in
the [./ocr/ directory](ocr/)), which should ultimately correspond with versing
of the King James Version, and the layout of the 1904 printing (found in
volumes [1](https://archive.org/stream/oldcovenantcommo01thom) and
[2](https://archive.org/stream/oldcovenantcommo02thom) on the Internet
Archive).

Additionally, proofreading of the completed books, including for typos,
formatting, and versification, is greatly appreciated. Submit a pull request or
open an issue! Every fix, even if it's just one letter, counts!
