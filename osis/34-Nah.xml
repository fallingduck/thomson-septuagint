<chapter osisID="Nah.1" sID="Nah.1"/>
<p type="x-embedded">
<verse osisID="Nah.1.1" sID="Nah.1.1"/>The sentence on Ninive. The book of the vision of Nahum, the Elkosite.</p>
<p><verse eID="Nah.1.1"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.2" sID="Nah.1.2"/>God is zealous. The Lord is about to take vengeance: the Lord is about to take vengeance with wrath: the Lord is about to take vengeance on his adversaries, and to destroy utterly his enemies, himself.</p>
<p>
<speaker>An objection</speaker><verse eID="Nah.1.2"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.3" sID="Nah.1.3"/>The Lord is slow to anger, though his power is great; will not the Lord then acquit the innocent? Is his way in destruction and whirlwind, when clouds are the dust of his feet?<verse eID="Nah.1.3"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.4" sID="Nah.1.4"/>When he rebuketh the sea he maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel are diminished and the bloom of Libanus languished.<verse eID="Nah.1.4"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.5" sID="Nah.1.5"/>At him the mountains quake and the hills tremble; at his presence the earth is startled—the world and all its inhabitants.<verse eID="Nah.1.5"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.6" sID="Nah.1.6"/>At the presence of his wrath who can stand, or who can resist his fierce indignation? His wrath dissolveth governments, and by him the rocks are rent to pieces.</p>
<p>
<speaker>The answer</speaker><verse eID="Nah.1.6"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.7" sID="Nah.1.7"/>The Lord is kind to them who wait for him in a day of distress: and he knoweth them who reverence him.<verse eID="Nah.1.7"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.8" sID="Nah.1.8"/>When with a deluging march he maketh destruction; them who raise themselves up and are his enemies, darkness shall pursue.<verse eID="Nah.1.8"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.9" sID="Nah.1.9"/>What are you devising against the Lord? He will make complete destruction, and not punish twice by distress for the same thing.<verse eID="Nah.1.9"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.10" sID="Nah.1.10"/>Because one shall be utterly destroyed, and consumed like bindweed and dry stubble;<verse eID="Nah.1.10"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.11" sID="Nah.1.11"/>shall a reasoning against the Lord proceed from thee; O wicked city, devising things in opposition?<verse eID="Nah.1.11"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.12" sID="Nah.1.12"/>Thus saith the Lord, With respect to the ruler of many waters! they shall be so dispersed, that what thou hearest shall be heard no more.<verse eID="Nah.1.12"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.13" sID="Nah.1.13"/>I will now break his sceptre from thee, and burst the bands asunder.<verse eID="Nah.1.13"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.14" sID="Nah.1.14"/>Concerning thee the Lord will command, let none of thy name be sown any more. From the house of thy God I will root out the graven and molten images; "I will make it a sepulchre for thee."</p>
<p>
<speaker>Nahum</speaker><verse eID="Nah.1.14"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.1.15" sID="Nah.1.15"/>Because yonder on the mountain are the swift feet of one bringing good news—even of one announcing peace; O Juda, solemnize thy festivals; pay thy vows; for they shall no more proceed to pass through thee for conflict. It is completely laid waste, entirely removed.<verse eID="Nah.1.15"/></p><chapter eID="Nah.1"/>
<chapter osisID="Nah.2" sID="Nah.2"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.1" sID="Nah.2.1"/>Into thy presence came up panting one who is delivered from affliction. Watch the way; strengthen thy loins; act manfully with all thy might,<verse eID="Nah.2.1"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.2" sID="Nah.2.2"/>since the Lord hath averted contumely from Jacob, as he did reproach from Israel, since emptiers have emptied them out and destroyed their branches—<verse eID="Nah.2.2"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.3" sID="Nah.2.3"/>the instruments of their tyranny from among men—their mighty men insulting with fire. In the day of his preparation the reins of their chariots, and the horsemen will be disordered in their ranks;<verse eID="Nah.2.3"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.4" sID="Nah.2.4"/>and the chariots will justle together and be entangled with one another in the streets. The appearance of them is like flaming torches and like streamy lightning.<verse eID="Nah.2.4"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.5" sID="Nah.2.5"/>Their grandees will recollect and flee by day; but they shall be weak in their march. While they shall be hasting to her walls, and preparing their out guards;<verse eID="Nah.2.5"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.6" sID="Nah.2.6"/>the gates of the cities are opened, and the palaces are fallen.<verse eID="Nah.2.6"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.7" sID="Nah.2.7"/>And the empress herself is exposed to view; even she herself is gone up, and her maids are led along cooing plaintively like doves, in their hearts.<verse eID="Nah.2.7"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.8" sID="Nah.2.8"/>As for Ninive, her waters are like a standing pool. They who fled away made no halt, nor was there one who looked back.<verse eID="Nah.2.8"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.9" sID="Nah.2.9"/>They plundered the silver; they plundered the gold; but of her furniture there was no end; every one is loaded with her precious utensils.<verse eID="Nah.2.9"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.10" sID="Nah.2.10"/>What quaking and driving! what groans and heart breaking! what feebleness of knees and pangs in every loin! what blackness, like that of a pot, on the countenance of all!<verse eID="Nah.2.10"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.11" sID="Nah.2.11"/>where is the habitation of the lions, and the feeding places of the young lions? Where had the old lions gone, that a young lion entered and there was none to scare him?<verse eID="Nah.2.11"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.12" sID="Nah.2.12"/>The old lion had seized enough for his whelps, and had strangled for his lionesses, and had filled his hole with prey, and his den with ravin:<verse eID="Nah.2.12"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.2.13" sID="Nah.2.13"/>behold I am against thee saith the Lord Almighty, and I will burn out thy multitude with smoke; and a sword shall devour thy lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth; and of thy deeds nothing more shall be heard.<verse eID="Nah.2.13"/></p><chapter eID="Nah.2"/>
<chapter osisID="Nah.3" sID="Nah.3"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.1" sID="Nah.3.1"/>bloody city, wholly perfidious and full of lies! shall not thy prey be handled?<verse eID="Nah.3.1"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.2" sID="Nah.3.2"/>A sound of whips! and the sound of the rumbling of wheels, and of the pursuing horse! and bounding chariot!<verse eID="Nah.3.2"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.3" sID="Nah.3.3"/>and of the cavalry advancing! and of the glittering sword and gleamy arms! and of the multitude of wounded! and of the hideous crash! Though there was no bound to her nations, they shall be weak of body<verse eID="Nah.3.3"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.4" sID="Nah.3.4"/>by reason of great fornication.</p>
<p>
O fair harlot and bewitching mistress of sorceries, who sellest nations by thy whoredom, and peoples by thy sorceries!<verse eID="Nah.3.4"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.5" sID="Nah.3.5"/>behold I am against thee, saith the Lord God Almighty, and I will expose thy skirts to view; and shew nations thy shame; and kingdoms, thy dishonour:<verse eID="Nah.3.5"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.6" sID="Nah.3.6"/>and cast abomination on thee according to thine impurities; and make thee a publick example,<verse eID="Nah.3.6"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.7" sID="Nah.3.7"/>so that every one who seeth thee shall go down from thee, and say, Wretched Ninive! who can bemoan her? Whence can I find comfort for her?<verse eID="Nah.3.7"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.8" sID="Nah.3.8"/>Prepare a funeral cake! attune the lyre! prepare the funeral cake of Ammon! she dwelt among rivers; water was around her. The sea was her dominions, and water, her walls,<verse eID="Nah.3.8"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.9" sID="Nah.3.9"/>and Ethiopia and Egypt, her strength; and the end of her flight was not
stopped and the Lybians were her auxiliaries.<verse eID="Nah.3.9"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.10" sID="Nah.3.10"/>Yet she is to go captive into banishment; and her infants shall be dashed to the ground at the head of all the streets; and for all her splendid treasures lots shall be cast; and all her grandees shall be bound with fetters.<verse eID="Nah.3.10"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.11" sID="Nah.3.11"/>And as for thee thou shalt be made drunk and be despised, and shalt seek for thyself a resting place from enemies.<verse eID="Nah.3.11"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.12" sID="Nah.3.12"/>All thy fortresses are like figs which have watchers; when shaken they will fall into the mouth of the eater.<verse eID="Nah.3.12"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.13" sID="Nah.3.13"/>Behold thy people in thee are like women; the gates of thy land shall be opened wide to thine enemies; a fire shall utterly devour thy bars.<verse eID="Nah.3.13"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.14" sID="Nah.3.14"/>Draw thee water for a siege, and fortify thy bulwarks. Go down into the clay, and let him be trampled with straw. Make it harder than any brick.<verse eID="Nah.3.14"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.15" sID="Nah.3.15"/>There a fire shall devour thee; a sword shall cut thee off. Like a locust it will devour thee; and like a brouchus locust thou shalt be afflicted.<verse eID="Nah.3.15"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.16" sID="Nah.3.16"/>Thou hast multiplied thy merchandise, above the stars of heaven; the brouchus came rushing on, and is flown.<verse eID="Nah.3.16"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.17" sID="Nah.3.17"/>Thy merchandise is swept away like the attelebos locust—like the small locust mounted on a hedge, in a cold day: the sun broke out and they are swept away, and their place is not known. Alas for them!<verse eID="Nah.3.17"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.18" sID="Nah.3.18"/>thy shepherds slumbered; an Assyrian king lulled to sleep thy mighty men: thy people fled to the mountains and there was none to rally them.<verse eID="Nah.3.18"/>
<verse osisID="Nah.3.19" sID="Nah.3.19"/>There is no cure for thy bruise. Thy wound is festered. All that hear the news of thee will clap their hands at thee. For upon whom hath not thy wickedness come continually?<verse eID="Nah.3.19"/></p><chapter eID="Nah.3"/>
