<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.1" sID="Gen.1.1"/>In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.<verse eID="Gen.1.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.2" sID="Gen.1.2"/>And the earth was invisible and unfurnished and there was darkness over this abyss; and a breath of God was brought on above the water.<verse eID="Gen.1.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.3" sID="Gen.1.3"/>And God said, "Let there be Light;" and there was light.<verse eID="Gen.1.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.4" sID="Gen.1.4"/>And God saw the light that it was good. And God made a separation between the light and the darkness.<verse eID="Gen.1.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.5" sID="Gen.1.5"/>And God called the light day; and the darkness he called night. And there was an evening and there was a morning. The first day.<verse eID="Gen.1.5"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.6" sID="Gen.1.6"/>Then God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water; and let it make a separation between water and water."<verse eID="Gen.1.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.7" sID="Gen.1.7"/>And it was so. God made the firmament; and God made a separation between the water which was below the firmament and the water which was above the firmament.<verse eID="Gen.1.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.8" sID="Gen.1.8"/>And God called the firmament, heaven. And God saw that it was good. And there was an evening and there was a morning. The second day.<verse eID="Gen.1.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.9" sID="Gen.1.9"/>Then God said, "Let the water which is below the heaven be gathered into one receptacle and let the dry land appear."<verse eID="Gen.1.9"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.10" sID="Gen.1.10"/>And it was so. The waters which were below the heaven were gathered into their several collections, and the dry land appeared. And God called the dry land, earth; and the collections of the waters he called, seas. And God saw that it was good.<verse eID="Gen.1.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.11" sID="Gen.1.11"/>And God said, "Let the earth produce the grassy plant with sowing seed according to kind and according to likeness, and the fruit bearing tree together with the fruit, the seed of which is in it according to kind, upon the earth." And it was so.<verse eID="Gen.1.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.12" sID="Gen.1.12"/>The earth indeed produced the grassy plant with sowing seed according to kind and according to likeness, and the fruit tree together with fruit, the
seed of which is in it, according to kind, in the earth. And God saw that it was good.<verse eID="Gen.1.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.13" sID="Gen.1.13"/>And there was an evening and there was a morning. The third day.<verse eID="Gen.1.13"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.14" sID="Gen.1.14"/>Then God said, "Let there be luminaries in the firmament of heaven, to give light on the earth; to make a separation between the day and the night: and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years;<verse eID="Gen.1.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.15" sID="Gen.1.15"/>and let them be for an illumination in the firmament of heaven so as to
shine on the earth." And it was so.<verse eID="Gen.1.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.16" sID="Gen.1.16"/>God indeed made the two great luminaries, the greater luminary for the regulations of the day, and the lesser luminary, with the stars, for the regulations of the night.<verse eID="Gen.1.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.17" sID="Gen.1.17"/>And God placed them in the firmament of heaven so as to shine on the earth,<verse eID="Gen.1.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.18" sID="Gen.1.18"/>and to regulate the day and the night, and to make a division between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.<verse eID="Gen.1.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.19" sID="Gen.1.19"/>And there was an evening and there was a morning. The fourth day.<verse eID="Gen.1.19"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.20" sID="Gen.1.20"/>Then God said, "Let the waters produce moving creatures having life; and winged creatures flying above the earth in the open firmament of heaven." And it was so.<verse eID="Gen.1.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.21" sID="Gen.1.21"/>God indeed made the great sea monsters and every species of moving animals which the waters produced according to their kinds, and every winged flying creature according to kind. And God saw that they were good.<verse eID="Gen.1.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.22" sID="Gen.1.22"/>And God blessed them saying, "Increase and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let flying creatures be multiplied on the earth."<verse eID="Gen.1.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.23" sID="Gen.1.23"/>And there was an evening and there was a morning. The fifth day.<verse eID="Gen.1.23"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.24" sID="Gen.1.24"/>Then God said, "Let the earth produce animal life according to kind; four footed beasts and reptiles and wild beasts of the earth according to kind." And it was so.<verse eID="Gen.1.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.25" sID="Gen.1.25"/>God indeed made the wild beasts of the earth according to their kind, and the cattle according to their kind, and all the reptiles of the earth according to kind. And God saw that they were good.<verse eID="Gen.1.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.26" sID="Gen.1.26"/>Then God said, "Let us make man after our image and after a likeness; and let them have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the cattle, and the whole earth, and all the reptiles which creep on the earth."<verse eID="Gen.1.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.27" sID="Gen.1.27"/>So God made man. After an image of God he made him. A male and a female he made them.<verse eID="Gen.1.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.28" sID="Gen.1.28"/>And God blessed them saying, "Increase and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all the cattle, and all the earth, and all the reptiles which creep on the earth."<verse eID="Gen.1.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.29" sID="Gen.1.29"/>Moreover God said, "Behold I have given you every seed bearing plant, the
sowing seed which is on the whole earth, and every tree which hath in itself the fruit of seminal seed, you shall have for food:<verse eID="Gen.1.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.30" sID="Gen.1.30"/>And to all the beasts of the earth, and to all the birds of the air, and to every reptile on the earth, which hath in it animal life, I have also given every green herb for food." And it was so.<verse eID="Gen.1.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.1.31" sID="Gen.1.31"/>And God saw all the things which he had made, and behold they were very good. And there was an evening and there was a morning. The sixth day.<verse eID="Gen.1.31"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.1"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.2" sID="Gen.2"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.1" sID="Gen.2.1"/>Thus were finished the heaven and the earth and all the arrangement of them.<verse eID="Gen.2.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.2" sID="Gen.2.2"/>And God finished on the sixth day these his works which he made; and on the seventh day he desisted from all these works of his which he made.<verse eID="Gen.2.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.3" sID="Gen.2.3"/>And God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it; because on it he rested from all these works of his which God had taken occasion to make.<verse eID="Gen.2.3"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.4" sID="Gen.2.4"/>This is the genealogy of heaven and earth. When they were made,—on the day when the Lord God had made the heaven and the earth,<verse eID="Gen.2.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.5" sID="Gen.2.5"/>and all the verdure of the field, before it was on the earth, and every herb of the field, before it sprang up, (for God had not rained on the earth, nor was there a man to till it;<verse eID="Gen.2.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.6" sID="Gen.2.6"/>but a fountain ascended out of the earth and watered the whole face of the ground,)<verse eID="Gen.2.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.7" sID="Gen.2.7"/>then God formed the man, dust from the earth, and breathed upon his face a breath of life, and the man became a living soul.<verse eID="Gen.2.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.8" sID="Gen.2.8"/>And God planted a garden in Eden towards the east and placed there the man whom he had made.<verse eID="Gen.2.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.9" sID="Gen.2.9"/>And God caused to spring up there also out of that ground every tree beautiful to the sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree for the purpose of knowing what was to be known of good and evil.<verse eID="Gen.2.9"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.10" sID="Gen.2.10"/>Now a river issueth out of Eden to water the garden: thence it is divided into four heads.<verse eID="Gen.2.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.11" sID="Gen.2.11"/>The name of the first is Physon. This is that which encircleth the whole country Evilat, where there is gold,<verse eID="Gen.2.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.12" sID="Gen.2.12"/>and the gold of that country is good. There also is the carbuncle and the Prasian stone.<verse eID="Gen.2.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.13" sID="Gen.2.13"/>And the name of the second river is Geon. This is that which encircleth the whole country of Ethiopia.<verse eID="Gen.2.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.14" sID="Gen.2.14"/>And the third river is Tigris. This is that which floweth down over against the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.<verse eID="Gen.2.14"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.15" sID="Gen.2.15"/>And the Lord God took the man whom he had made, and placed him in this garden of pleasure to work it and to watch.<verse eID="Gen.2.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.16" sID="Gen.2.16"/>And the Lord God gave a charge to Adam, saying, "Of every tree which is in the garden for food, thou mightest have eaten;<verse eID="Gen.2.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.17" sID="Gen.2.17"/>but from this tree, that you may know good and evil, you must not eat of it. On the day you eat of it, by death you shall die."<verse eID="Gen.2.17"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.18" sID="Gen.2.18"/>Then the Lord God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone: let us make for him a helper correspondent to himself."<verse eID="Gen.2.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.19" sID="Gen.2.19"/>Now God had also formed out of the earth all the beasts of the field, and all the birds of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called every living creature; that was its name.<verse eID="Gen.2.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.20" sID="Gen.2.20"/>So Adam gave names to all the cattle, and to all the fowls of the air, and to all the wild beasts of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.<verse eID="Gen.2.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.21" sID="Gen.2.21"/>Then God brought an ecstasy upon Adam and caused him to sleep, and took one of his ribs and filled up flesh instead thereof.<verse eID="Gen.2.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.22" sID="Gen.2.22"/>And God built up the rib, which he took from Adam, into a woman, and brought her to Adam.<verse eID="Gen.2.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.23" sID="Gen.2.23"/>And Adam said, "This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh, let her be called Woman." Because she was taken out of her man,<verse eID="Gen.2.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.24" sID="Gen.2.24"/>therefore a man is to leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.<verse eID="Gen.2.24"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.2.25" sID="Gen.2.25"/>Now the two, both Adam and his wife were naked, and were not ashamed.<verse eID="Gen.2.25"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.2"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.3" sID="Gen.3"/>
<p type="x-nobreak">
<verse osisID="Gen.3.1" sID="Gen.3.1"/>But the serpent was the wisest of all the beasts on the earth which the Lord God had made, and the serpent said to the woman, "Why hath God said, you must not eat of every tree of the garden?"<verse eID="Gen.3.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.2" sID="Gen.3.2"/>And the woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat;<verse eID="Gen.3.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.3" sID="Gen.3.3"/>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God
said, You shall not eat of it, nor touch it, that you may not die."<verse eID="Gen.3.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.4" sID="Gen.3.4"/>And the serpent said to the woman, "You will not by death die.<verse eID="Gen.3.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.5" sID="Gen.3.5"/>For God knew that in the day you eat thereof, your eyes would be opened and you would be like gods knowing good and evil."<verse eID="Gen.3.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.6" sID="Gen.3.6"/>And the woman saw that the tree was good for food; and that it is delightful to see with the eyes; and that to exercise understanding is comely,
so having taken some of the fruit thereof, she ate and gave also to her husband with her. And when they had eaten,<verse eID="Gen.3.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.7" sID="Gen.3.7"/>the eyes of them both were opened, and they perceived that they were naked. And they sewed together fig leaves and made for themselves girdles.<verse eID="Gen.3.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.8" sID="Gen.3.8"/>And when they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening, both Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God, among the trees of the garden.</p>
<p><verse eID="Gen.3.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.9" sID="Gen.3.9"/>And the Lord God called Adam and said to him, "Adam, where art thou?"<verse eID="Gen.3.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.10" sID="Gen.3.10"/>And he said to him, "I heard the sound of thee walking in the garden and I was afraid, because I am naked, and I hid myself."<verse eID="Gen.3.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.11" sID="Gen.3.11"/>And God said to him, "Who told thee that thou art naked, if so be thou hast not eaten of the tree of which alone I commanded thee not to eat of this?"<verse eID="Gen.3.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.12" sID="Gen.3.12"/>And Adam said, "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I did eat."<verse eID="Gen.3.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.13" sID="Gen.3.13"/>And the Lord God said to the woman, "Why hast thou done this?" And the woman said, "The serpent seduced me and I ate."<verse eID="Gen.3.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.14" sID="Gen.3.14"/>And the Lord God said to the serpent, "Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed from all the cattle and from all the beasts which are upon the earth. Upon thy breast and belly thou shalt go and shalt eat earth all the days of thy life.<verse eID="Gen.3.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.15" sID="Gen.3.15"/>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman; and between thy seed and her seed. He will wound thy head, and thou wilt wound his heel."<verse eID="Gen.3.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.16" sID="Gen.3.16"/>And to the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply thy sorrows and thy anguish. With sorrows thou shalt bear children and to thy husband shall be thy recourse, and he shall rule over thee."<verse eID="Gen.3.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.17" sID="Gen.3.17"/>And to Adam he said, "Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree of which alone I commanded thee not to eat, the ground is cursed by thy labours. With sorrows thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life.<verse eID="Gen.3.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.18" sID="Gen.3.18"/>Thorns and thistles it shall cause to spring up for thee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the field.<verse eID="Gen.3.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.19" sID="Gen.3.19"/>By the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread until thou return into the earth out of which thou wast taken; for earth thou art and to earth thou
shalt return."<verse eID="Gen.3.19"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.20" sID="Gen.3.20"/>And Adam called the name of his wife LIFE, because she was to be the mother of all the living.<verse eID="Gen.3.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.21" sID="Gen.3.21"/>And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skin and cloathed them.<verse eID="Gen.3.21"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.22" sID="Gen.3.22"/>And God said, "Behold Adam was made like one of us to know good and evil. And now perhaps he may stretch forth his hand and take of the tree of life and eat, so shall he live forever."<verse eID="Gen.3.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.23" sID="Gen.3.23"/>So the Lord God sent him out of the garden of pleasure to till the ground out of which he was taken.<verse eID="Gen.3.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.3.24" sID="Gen.3.24"/>And when he put Adam out he caused him to dwell over against the garden of pleasure and stationed the Cherubim and the whirling flame of fire to keep the way to the tree of life.<verse eID="Gen.3.24"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.3"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.4" sID="Gen.4"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.1" sID="Gen.4.1"/>And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and brought forth Cain, and
said, "I have gotten a man from God."<verse eID="Gen.4.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.2" sID="Gen.4.2"/>And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel became a keeper of
sheep, and Cain tilled the ground.<verse eID="Gen.4.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.3" sID="Gen.4.3"/>And when in process of time Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a
sacrifice to the Lord,<verse eID="Gen.4.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.4" sID="Gen.4.4"/>and Abel also brought, he indeed of the firstlings of his flock even some of the fattest of them, God looked upon Abel and on his gifts;<verse eID="Gen.4.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.5" sID="Gen.4.5"/>but upon Cain and upon his sacrifices he did not look with regard. Thereupon Cain was exceedingly grieved and his countenance became dejected.<verse eID="Gen.4.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.6" sID="Gen.4.6"/>And the Lord God said to Cain, "Why art thou become sorrowful and why is thy countenance dejected?"<verse eID="Gen.4.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.7" sID="Gen.4.7"/>Though thou hast offered right, yet if thou hast not rightly divided, hast thou not sinned? Be composed. To thee shall be his recourse, and thou shalt rule over him."<verse eID="Gen.4.7"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.8" sID="Gen.4.8"/>Then Cain said to Abel his brother, "Let us go into the plain." And when they were in the plain, Cain rose upon Abel his brother and slew him.<verse eID="Gen.4.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.9" sID="Gen.4.9"/>And when the Lord God said to Cain, "Where is Abel thy brother?" he said I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?<verse eID="Gen.4.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.10" sID="Gen.4.10"/>Then the Lord said, "What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me out of the ground.<verse eID="Gen.4.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.11" sID="Gen.4.11"/>Now therefore thou art cursed from this land, which hath opened its mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy hand.<verse eID="Gen.4.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.12" sID="Gen.4.12"/>When thou tillest the ground, it will not henceforth yield thee its
strength. Thou shalt be in a state of anguish and terror in this land."<verse eID="Gen.4.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.13" sID="Gen.4.13"/>And Cain said to the Lord God, "Is my fault too great to be forgiven?<verse eID="Gen.4.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.14" sID="Gen.4.14"/>If thou castest me out this day from the face of this land and I be hid from thy presence and be in a state of anguish and terror in the land, it will come to pass that whoever findeth me will kill me."<verse eID="Gen.4.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.15" sID="Gen.4.15"/>And the Lord said to him, "Not so. Whosoever killeth Cain shall suffer
seven fold vengeance." And the Lord God gave a sign to Cain, that whoever found him would not kill him.<verse eID="Gen.4.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.16" sID="Gen.4.16"/>So Cain went out from the presence of God and dwelt in the land of Naid over against Eden.<verse eID="Gen.4.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.17" sID="Gen.4.17"/>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and brought forth Enoch. And he employed himself in building a city and he called the city Enoch after his
son's name.<verse eID="Gen.4.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.18" sID="Gen.4.18"/>And to Enoch was born Gaidad; and Gaidad begot Maleleel, and Maleleel begot Mathousala, and Mathousala begot Lamech.<verse eID="Gen.4.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.19" sID="Gen.4.19"/>And Lamech took to himself two wives. The name of the first was Aria; and the name of the second Sella.<verse eID="Gen.4.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.20" sID="Gen.4.20"/>And Ada bore Jobel. He was the father of them who dwell in tents, feeding cattle.<verse eID="Gen.4.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.21" sID="Gen.4.21"/>And the name of his brother was Jonbal. He was the inventor of the psaltery and kithara.<verse eID="Gen.4.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.22" sID="Gen.4.22"/>As for Sella, she also bore Thobel, and he was a smith, a manufacturer of brass and iron; and the sister of Thobel was Noema.<verse eID="Gen.4.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.23" sID="Gen.4.23"/>And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sella,
<lg><l level="1">"Hearken to my voice, ye wives of Lamech,</l>
<l level="1">"Listen attentively to my words.</l>
<l level="1">"For have I slain a man that I should be wounded,</l>
<l level="1">"And a young man that I should be hurt?</l><verse eID="Gen.4.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.24" sID="Gen.4.24"/><l level="1">"For seven fold vengeance was to be taken for Cain;</l>
<l level="1">"But for Lamech will be taken seventy times seven."</l></lg><verse eID="Gen.4.24"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.25" sID="Gen.4.25"/>And Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and brought forth a son and called his name Seth, saying, "For God hath raised up for me another seed in the place of Abel whom Cain slew."<verse eID="Gen.4.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.4.26" sID="Gen.4.26"/>And Seth had a son; and he called his name Enos. He hoped that he would invoke the name of the Lord God.<verse eID="Gen.4.26"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.4"/>

On the day God made Adam, he made him after an image of God.<verse eID="Gen.5.1"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.19.14" sID="Gen.19.14"/>Upon this Lot went out and spoke to his sons in law, who had bethrothed his daughters and said, Arise and depart from this place; for the Lord is going to destroy this city. But he seemed to his sons in law to be mocking.<verse eID="Gen.19.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.15" sID="Gen.19.15"/>Now when it was break of day the angels hurried Lot, saying, Arise and take thy wife and thy two daughters whom thou hast, and get away, lest thou also perish for the iniquities of this city.<verse eID="Gen.19.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.16" sID="Gen.19.16"/>But they were confounded. So the angels took hold of his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hands of his two daughters, as the Lord spared him.<verse eID="Gen.19.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.17" sID="Gen.19.17"/>And having led them out they said, Escape for thy life. Look not back, nor stop in any part of the plain around. Escape to the mountains, lest peradventure thou be overtaken.<verse eID="Gen.19.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.18" sID="Gen.19.18"/>Thereupon Lot said to them, I beseech thee, Lord,<verse eID="Gen.19.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.19" sID="Gen.19.19"/>since thy servant hath found favour in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy kindness in what thou dost for me to save my life. I cannot escape to the mountains. Peradventure the calamity may overtake me and I shall die.<verse eID="Gen.19.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.20" sID="Gen.19.20"/>Behold that city is nigh for me to flee to. It is little and thither I can escape. Is it not little? And my soul shall live by thy means.<verse eID="Gen.19.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.21" sID="Gen.19.21"/>And he said, Behold I have indulged thee also in this matter, so as not to destroy that city of which thou hast spoken.<verse eID="Gen.19.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.22" sID="Gen.19.22"/>Haste therefore to escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou get there. For this cause he called the name of that city, Segor.<verse eID="Gen.19.22"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.23" sID="Gen.19.23"/>The sun was risen on the earth when Lot entered Segor;<verse eID="Gen.19.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.24" sID="Gen.19.24"/>and the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorra brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.<verse eID="Gen.19.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.25" sID="Gen.19.25"/>And he overthrew these cities, and all the circumjacent country, and all the inhabitants of those cities, and all the productions of the ground.<verse eID="Gen.19.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.26" sID="Gen.19.26"/>And Lot's wife having looked back was turned into a pillar of salt.<verse eID="Gen.19.26"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.27" sID="Gen.19.27"/>And Abraham went early in the morning to the place, where he had stood before the Lord,<verse eID="Gen.19.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.28" sID="Gen.19.28"/>and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorra and towards the circumjacent plain, and he beheld and lo! a flame ascended out of the earth like the smoke of a furnace.<verse eID="Gen.19.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.29" sID="Gen.19.29"/>But when God destroyed all the cities of that neighbourhood he remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out from that destruction.</p>
<p>
Now when the Lord had destroyed those cities in which Lot had dwelt,<verse eID="Gen.19.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.30" sID="Gen.19.30"/>Lot went up out of Segor, and he and his two daughters with him settled in the mountains; for he was afraid to dwell in Segor. So he and his two daughters with him took up their abode in a cave.<verse eID="Gen.19.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.31" sID="Gen.19.31"/>And the elder said to the younger, Our father is old and there is none in this land who will come in unto us, as is customary in all the earth.<verse eID="Gen.19.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.32" sID="Gen.19.32"/>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him that we may raise up seed from our father.<verse eID="Gen.19.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.33" sID="Gen.19.33"/>So they made their father drink wine that very night, and the elder having gone in lay with her father that night, and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.<verse eID="Gen.19.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.34" sID="Gen.19.34"/>And on the next night the elder said to the younger, Lo! I lay with our father last night, let us make him drink wine this night also, and do thou go in and lie with him and let us raise up seed from our father.<verse eID="Gen.19.34"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.35" sID="Gen.19.35"/>So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger went in and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when
she arose.<verse eID="Gen.19.35"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.36" sID="Gen.19.36"/>Thus the two daughters of Lot conceived by their father.<verse eID="Gen.19.36"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.37" sID="Gen.19.37"/>And the eldest bore a son and called his name Moab, saying From my father. He is the father of the present Moabites.<verse eID="Gen.19.37"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.19.38" sID="Gen.19.38"/>And the youngest also bore a son and called his name Amman saying, Son of the same as I. He is the father of the present Ammanites.<verse eID="Gen.19.38"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.19"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.20" sID="Gen.20"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.1" sID="Gen.20.1"/>Now Abraham had removed thence into the south country, and made his abode between Kades and Sour, and sojourned among the Gerarites.<verse eID="Gen.20.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.2" sID="Gen.20.2"/>And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. For he was afraid to
say, She is my wife, lest the men of the city should kill him on her account.<verse eID="Gen.20.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.3" sID="Gen.20.3"/>And Abimelech the king of the Gerarites sent and took Sarah. And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said, Behold thou diest for this woman, whom thou hast taken; for she is the man's wife.<verse eID="Gen.20.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.4" sID="Gen.20.4"/>Now Abimelech had not touched her. And Abimelech said, Lord, wilt thou destroy an unknowing and righteous nation?<verse eID="Gen.20.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.5" sID="Gen.20.5"/>Did he not tell me, She is my sister? And did not she say to me, He is my brother? With a pure heart and innocent hands I have done this.<verse eID="Gen.20.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.6" sID="Gen.20.6"/>And God said to him in a dream, I know indeed that with a pure heart thou hast done this, and out of compassion I withheld thee from sinning against me. For this cause I suffered thee not to touch her.<verse eID="Gen.20.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.7" sID="Gen.20.7"/>Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet; and he will pray for thee and thou shalt live. But if thou restore not, be assured that thou and all belonging to thee shall die.<verse eID="Gen.20.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.8" sID="Gen.20.8"/>And Abimelech arose early next morning and called all his servants and related all these things in their hearing. And all the men were exceedingly terrified.<verse eID="Gen.20.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.9" sID="Gen.20.9"/>Then Abimelech sent for Abraham and said to him, Why hast thou dealt thus with us? Have we in any respect sinned against thee, that thou shouldst bring upon me and upon my kingdom this great sin? Thou hast done to me what no one
should do.<verse eID="Gen.20.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.10" sID="Gen.20.10"/>Moreover Abimelech said to Abraham, What didst thou see that thou
shouldst do this?<verse eID="Gen.20.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.11" sID="Gen.20.11"/>And Abraham said, I indeed thought, as there is no worship of God in this place, they will kill me for my wife's sake.<verse eID="Gen.20.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.12" sID="Gen.20.12"/>And indeed of a truth she is my sister by the same father but not of the
same mother, so she became my wife.<verse eID="Gen.20.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.13" sID="Gen.20.13"/>And when God led me out from my father's house I said to her, Thou wilt do me this kindness. To what place soever we come say of me, He is my brother.<verse eID="Gen.20.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.14" sID="Gen.20.14"/>Then Abimelech took, a thousand didrachms and sheep and oxen and men
servants and maid servants and gave them to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.<verse eID="Gen.20.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.15" sID="Gen.20.15"/>And Abimelech said to Abraham, Behold my land is before thee; dwell wherever it may please thee.<verse eID="Gen.20.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.16" sID="Gen.20.16"/>And to Sarah he said, Behold I have given thy brother a thousand didrachms. Let these therefore be for thee to adorn thy countenance and for all the women with thee. Make thou therefore all things hereafter accord with truth.<verse eID="Gen.20.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.17" sID="Gen.20.17"/>Then Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maid servants and they bore children.<verse eID="Gen.20.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.20.18" sID="Gen.20.18"/>For the Lord had shut up every womb in Abimelech family on the account of Sarah the wife of Abraham. Chapter 21<verse eID="Gen.20.18"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.20"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.21" sID="Gen.21"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.1" sID="Gen.21.1"/>Now the Lord visited Sarah as he had said. And the Lord did for Sarah as he had spoken,<verse eID="Gen.21.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.2" sID="Gen.21.2"/>and she conceived and bare a son to Abraham in old age at the set time, of which the Lord had spoken to him.<verse eID="Gen.21.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.3" sID="Gen.21.3"/>And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaak.<verse eID="Gen.21.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.4" sID="Gen.21.4"/>And Abraham circumcised Isaak on the eighth day, as God had commanded him.<verse eID="Gen.21.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.5" sID="Gen.21.5"/>Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaak was born to him.<verse eID="Gen.21.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.6" sID="Gen.21.6"/>And Sarah said, The Lord hath made laughter for me; for whoever shall hear will rejoice with me.<verse eID="Gen.21.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.7" sID="Gen.21.7"/>And she said, Who will tell Abraham that Sarah is suckling a child—that I have born a son in my old age!<verse eID="Gen.21.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.8" sID="Gen.21.8"/>And the child grew and was weaned and Abraham made a great entertainment on the day his son Isaak was weaned.<verse eID="Gen.21.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.9" sID="Gen.21.9"/>And when Sarah saw the son of Agar the Egyptian who was born to Abraham
sporting with her son Isaak,<verse eID="Gen.21.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.10" sID="Gen.21.10"/>she said to Abraham, Send away this girl and her son; for the son of this girl shall not be heir with my son Isaak.<verse eID="Gen.21.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.11" sID="Gen.21.11"/>And the thing appeared very hard in Abraham's view, touching his son.<verse eID="Gen.21.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.12" sID="Gen.21.12"/>But God said to Abraham, Let not this respecting thy son and respecting the handmaid appear hard in thy view. Hearken to the voice of Sarah in whatever
she may have said to thee. For in Isaak a seed shall be called for thee.<verse eID="Gen.21.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.13" sID="Gen.21.13"/>Nevertheless I will make the son of this handmaid a great nation, because he is thy seed.<verse eID="Gen.21.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.14" sID="Gen.21.14"/>So Abraham arose early the next morning and took loaves and a skin full of water, and when he had put them on her shoulder he gave the boy to Agar and
sent her away. And she departing lost her way between the wilderness and Well of the Oath;<verse eID="Gen.21.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.15" sID="Gen.21.15"/>And the water in the skin being spent she laid the boy under the first pine tree<verse eID="Gen.21.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.16" sID="Gen.21.16"/>and going away sat down over against him at the distance of about a bow
shot. For she said, I cannot behold the death of my son. So she sat over against him and the lad wept with a loud voice.<verse eID="Gen.21.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.17" sID="Gen.21.17"/>And God heard the voice of the lad from the place where he was. And an angel of God called to Agar out of heaven and said, "What is the matter, Agar? Fear not. For God hath heard the voice of the lad from the place where he is.<verse eID="Gen.21.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.18" sID="Gen.21.18"/>Arise and take up the boy and support him with thy hand; for I will make him a great nation."<verse eID="Gen.21.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.19" sID="Gen.21.19"/>And God opened her eyes and she saw a well of spring water. So she went and filled the vessel with water and gave the boy drink.<verse eID="Gen.21.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.20" sID="Gen.21.20"/>And God was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became a bowman.<verse eID="Gen.21.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.21" sID="Gen.21.21"/>Thus he dwelt in the wilderness, and his mother took for him a wife from Pharan of Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.21.21"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.22" sID="Gen.21.22"/>Now it happened at that time that Abimelech, accompanied with Ochozath his chamberlain and Phichol the general of his army, spoke to Abraham saying, God is with thee in all that thou dost.<verse eID="Gen.21.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.23" sID="Gen.21.23"/>Now therefore swear to me by God, that thou wilt not injure me nor my
seed nor my name; but that according to the kindness with which I have treated thee, thou wilt deal with me and this land in which thou hast sojourned.<verse eID="Gen.21.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.24" sID="Gen.21.24"/>And Abraham said, I swear.<verse eID="Gen.21.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.25" sID="Gen.21.25"/>Then Abraham expostulated with Abimelech touching the wells of water which the servants of Abimelech had taken.<verse eID="Gen.21.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.26" sID="Gen.21.26"/>And Abimelech said to him, I did not know that any one had done this to thee. Thou didst not tell me, nor did I hear of it till this day.<verse eID="Gen.21.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.27" sID="Gen.21.27"/>Then Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech; and they both made a covenant.<verse eID="Gen.21.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.28" sID="Gen.21.28"/>Now Abraham had set seven ewe lambs by themselves;<verse eID="Gen.21.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.29" sID="Gen.21.29"/>And Abimelech said to Abraham, What are these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?<verse eID="Gen.21.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.30" sID="Gen.21.30"/>Upon which Abraham said, These seven ewe lambs thou wilt take of me that they may be a witness for me, that I digged this well.<verse eID="Gen.21.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.31" sID="Gen.21.31"/>For this cause he called the name of that place, Well of the Oath, because both of them sword there and made a covenant<verse eID="Gen.21.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.32" sID="Gen.21.32"/>at Well of the Oath. Then arose Abimelech and Ochozath his chamberlain and Phichol the general of his army and returned to the land of the Philistines;<verse eID="Gen.21.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.33" sID="Gen.21.33"/>and Abraham planted a field at Well of the Oath and there invoked the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.<verse eID="Gen.21.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.21.34" sID="Gen.21.34"/>And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.<verse eID="Gen.21.34"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.21"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.22" sID="Gen.22"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.1" sID="Gen.22.1"/>And it came to pass after these things that God tried Abraham and said to him, Abraham! Abraham! And he said, Here I am.<verse eID="Gen.22.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.2" sID="Gen.22.2"/>And he said, Take thy son, thy dear son whom thou hast loved—Isaak; and go to the hilly country and offer him up there for a whole homage offering on one of the hills which I will point out to thee.<verse eID="Gen.22.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.3" sID="Gen.22.3"/>So Abraham arose in the morning and saddled his ass and took with him two
servants and his son Isaak: and having split wood for the whole homage offering he set out on the journey and came to the place which God told him<verse eID="Gen.22.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.4" sID="Gen.22.4"/>on the third day. Now when Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place at a distance<verse eID="Gen.22.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.5" sID="Gen.22.5"/>he said to his servants, Stay here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder, and when we have worshipped we will return to you.<verse eID="Gen.22.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.6" sID="Gen.22.6"/>Then Abraham took the wood of the whole homage offering and laid it on his
son Isaak; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife, and they both proceeded on together.<verse eID="Gen.22.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.7" sID="Gen.22.7"/>And Isaak said to his father Abraham, Father. And he said, What is the matter, son? And Isaak said, Here is the fire and the wood; where is the sheep for a whole homage offering?<verse eID="Gen.22.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.8" sID="Gen.22.8"/>And Abraham said, My son! God will provide for himself a sheep for a whole homage offering. So they both proceeded on together<verse eID="Gen.22.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.9" sID="Gen.22.9"/>and came to the place which God told him. And Abraham built there the altar, and placed thereon the wood; and having bound his son Isaak he laid him on the altar above the wood.<verse eID="Gen.22.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.10" sID="Gen.22.10"/>And when Abraham stretched forth his hand to take hold of the knife to
slay his son,<verse eID="Gen.22.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.11" sID="Gen.22.11"/>the angel of the Lord called to him out of heaven and said, Abraham! Abraham! And he said, Here I am.<verse eID="Gen.22.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.12" sID="Gen.22.12"/>And he said, Lay not thy hand on the lad, nor do any thing to him; for now I know that thou fearest God and on my account hast not spared thy darling
son.<verse eID="Gen.22.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.13" sID="Gen.22.13"/>Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and lo! a ram caught by the horns in a sabek bush. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for an homage offering instead of his son Isaak.<verse eID="Gen.22.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.14" sID="Gen.22.14"/>And Abraham called the name of that place, The Lord hath seen, that at this day they might say, On this mountain, The Lord was seen.<verse eID="Gen.22.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.15" sID="Gen.22.15"/>Then the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven,<verse eID="Gen.22.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.16" sID="Gen.22.16"/>saying, By myself I have sworn, saith the Lord, Because thou hast done this, and for my sake hast not spared thy beloved son;<verse eID="Gen.22.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.17" sID="Gen.22.17"/>with blessings I will indeed bless thee; and I will multiply thy seed abundantly as the stars of heaven and as the sand on the sea shore: and thy
seed shall inherit the cities of their adversaries;<verse eID="Gen.22.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.18" sID="Gen.22.18"/>and by the seed of thee all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because thou hast hearkened to my voice.<verse eID="Gen.22.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.19" sID="Gen.22.19"/>Then Abraham returned to his servants and they arose and came together to Well of the Oath, for Abraham lived at Well of the Oath.<verse eID="Gen.22.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.20" sID="Gen.22.20"/>And after these things it was told Abraham saying, With regard to Melcha, behold she also hath born sons to thy brother Nachor,<verse eID="Gen.22.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.21" sID="Gen.22.21"/>Ouz the first born, and Baux his brother, and Hamuel, the father of the Syrians,<verse eID="Gen.22.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.22" sID="Gen.22.22"/>and Chazad and Azau, and Phaldes and Jeldaph and Bathuel;<verse eID="Gen.22.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.23" sID="Gen.22.23"/>and Bathuel begot Rebekka. These were the eight sons, whom Melcha bore to Nachor the brother of Abraham.<verse eID="Gen.22.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.22.24" sID="Gen.22.24"/>And his concubine whose name was Reuma bore also Tabek and Gaam and Tochos and Mocha.<verse eID="Gen.22.24"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.22"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.23" sID="Gen.23"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.1" sID="Gen.23.1"/>Now the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty seven years.<verse eID="Gen.23.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.2" sID="Gen.23.2"/>And Sarah died in the city Arbok, which is in the vale, the same is Chebron in the land of Chanaan. And Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to make lamentation.<verse eID="Gen.23.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.3" sID="Gen.23.3"/>And Abraham arose from before his dead and spoke to the children of Chet,
saying,<verse eID="Gen.23.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.4" sID="Gen.23.4"/>I am a stranger and sojourner among you, give me therefore the possession of a burying place among you, that I may bury my dead from before me.<verse eID="Gen.23.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.5" sID="Gen.23.5"/>And the children of Chet answered and said to Abraham,<verse eID="Gen.23.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.6" sID="Gen.23.6"/>Nay, Sir, rather hearken to us. Thou art a king from God among us. In the choice of our tombs bury thy dead; for there is none of us who will deny thee his tomb to bury there thy dead.<verse eID="Gen.23.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.7" sID="Gen.23.7"/>Then Abraham standing up made obeisance to the people of the land—the children of Chet.<verse eID="Gen.23.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.8" sID="Gen.23.8"/>And Abraham spoke to them saying, If it be your wish that I should bury this my dead out of my sight, hearken to me and speak for me to Ephron the son of Saar.<verse eID="Gen.23.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.9" sID="Gen.23.9"/>And let him give me the double cave which belongeth to him—that which is in a part of his field. Let him give it to me for the full value of it, among you, for a possession of a burying place.<verse eID="Gen.23.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.10" sID="Gen.23.10"/>Now Ephron was sitting among the children of Chet; And Ephron the Chettite answered Abraham and said in the hearing of the children of Chet and of all coming into the city,<verse eID="Gen.23.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.11" sID="Gen.23.11"/>Attend, Sir, and hearken to me. The field and the cave which is in it I give thee. In the presence of my fellow citizens I have given them to thee. Bury thy dead.<verse eID="Gen.23.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.12" sID="Gen.23.12"/>And when Abraham had made obeisance before all the people of the land,<verse eID="Gen.23.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.13" sID="Gen.23.13"/>he said to Ephron in the hearing of all the people of the land, As thou art here before me, hearken to me. Take of me in silver the value of the field and I will bury my dead there.<verse eID="Gen.23.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.14" sID="Gen.23.14"/>Whereupon Ephron answered Abraham, saying,<verse eID="Gen.23.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.15" sID="Gen.23.15"/>Nay, Sir, I have indeed heard that the land is worth four hundred didrachms of silver; but what can that be between me and thee? But bury thou thy dead.<verse eID="Gen.23.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.16" sID="Gen.23.16"/>And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham paid down to Ephron the money which he mentioned in the hearing of the children of Chet, four hundred didrachms of silver current among merchants.<verse eID="Gen.23.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.17" sID="Gen.23.17"/>So the field of Ephron including the double cave which is situate before Mambre, the field and the cave in it and all the wood in the field and all within the bounds thereof round about were conveyed<verse eID="Gen.23.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.18" sID="Gen.23.18"/>to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Chet and of all who entered the city.<verse eID="Gen.23.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.19" sID="Gen.23.19"/>After this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the double cave of the field which is over against Mambre (the same is Chebron in the land of Chanaan.<verse eID="Gen.23.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.23.20" sID="Gen.23.20"/>And the property of the field and the cave in it was confirmed to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Chet.<verse eID="Gen.23.20"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.23"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.24" sID="Gen.24"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.1" sID="Gen.24.1"/>Now Abraham was old and far advanced in years, and the Lord had blessed him in all things.<verse eID="Gen.24.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.2" sID="Gen.24.2"/>And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his family and who was ruler over all that he had, Put thy hand under my thigh,<verse eID="Gen.24.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.3" sID="Gen.24.3"/>and let me cause thee to swear by the Lord the God of heaven and the God of earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son Isaak, of the daughters of the Chananites among whom I dwell;<verse eID="Gen.24.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.4" sID="Gen.24.4"/>but that thou wilt go to the land where I was born, and to my tribe and take thence a wife for my son Isaak.<verse eID="Gen.24.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.5" sID="Gen.24.5"/>And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to come with me to this land; shall I take back thy son to the land from which thou earnest?<verse eID="Gen.24.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.6" sID="Gen.24.6"/>Whereupon Abraham said to him, Beware that thou take not back my son thither.<verse eID="Gen.24.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.7" sID="Gen.24.7"/>The Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my nativity; who spoke to me, and who sware to me saying, "To thee I will give this land and to thy seed;" he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take thence a wife for my son.<verse eID="Gen.24.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.8" sID="Gen.24.8"/>But if the woman will not come with thee into this land, thou shalt be absolved from this my oath, save that thou must not take my son back thither.<verse eID="Gen.24.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.9" sID="Gen.24.9"/>Then the servant put his hand under his master Abraham's thigh, and swore to him respecting this matter.<verse eID="Gen.24.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.10" sID="Gen.24.10"/>And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master; and of all the goods of his master which were in his charge, and arose and went to Mesopotamia to the city of Nachor.<verse eID="Gen.24.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.11" sID="Gen.24.11"/>And he made his camels lie down without the city, by the well of water, in the evening, when the women come out to draw water;<verse eID="Gen.24.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.12" sID="Gen.24.12"/>and said, Lord the God of my master Abraham, prosper the way before me this day; and shew thy kindness to my master Abraham.<verse eID="Gen.24.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.13" sID="Gen.24.13"/>Behold I stand by this well of water and the daughters of the inhabitants of the city will come out to draw water.<verse eID="Gen.24.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.14" sID="Gen.24.14"/>Now let the virgin to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher that I may drink; and who shall say, Drink thou, and I will give water also to thy camels till they have all done drinking; let her be the woman whom thou hast provided for thy servant Isaak. And by this I shall know that thou hast dealt mercifully with my master Abraham.<verse eID="Gen.24.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.15" sID="Gen.24.15"/>And before he had finished this mental speech, lo! Rebekka the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Melcha, the wife of Nachor, Abraham's brother, came out with her pitcher on her shoulder.<verse eID="Gen.24.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.16" sID="Gen.24.16"/>Now the damsel was of a very beautiful countenance and was a virgin. No man had known her. So when she had gone down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up,<verse eID="Gen.24.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.17" sID="Gen.24.17"/>the servant ran to meet her and said, Let me drink a little water out of thy pitcher.<verse eID="Gen.24.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.18" sID="Gen.24.18"/>Upon which she said, Drink, my lord, and hastened to let down the pitcher on her arm and let him drink till he was satisfied.<verse eID="Gen.24.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.19" sID="Gen.24.19"/>Then she said, I will draw water for thy camels also until they shall have all drunk.<verse eID="Gen.24.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.20" sID="Gen.24.20"/>And she hasted and emptied the pitcher into the watering trough and ran to the well to draw more and drew water for all the camels.<verse eID="Gen.24.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.21" sID="Gen.24.21"/>And the man observed her attentively and held his peace, that he might know whether the Lord had prospered his journey or not.<verse eID="Gen.24.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.22" sID="Gen.24.22"/>And when all the camels had done drinking, the man took ear rings of gold of about a drachm weight, and a pair of bracelets for her hands, the weight of which was ten pieces of gold,<verse eID="Gen.24.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.23" sID="Gen.24.23"/>and he asked her saying, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, is there room at thy father's house for us to lodge?<verse eID="Gen.24.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.24" sID="Gen.24.24"/>And she said, I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Melcha, whom she bore to Nachor.<verse eID="Gen.24.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.25" sID="Gen.24.25"/>Moreover she said to him, We have plenty of straw and provender and room to lodge in.<verse eID="Gen.24.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.26" sID="Gen.24.26"/>Then the man being satisfied, worshipped the Lord<verse eID="Gen.24.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.27" sID="Gen.24.27"/>and said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not withdrawn his kindness and his truth from my master. The Lord hath indeed given me a prosperous journey to the house of my master's brother.<verse eID="Gen.24.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.28" sID="Gen.24.28"/>Upon this the damsel ran to her mother's house and told all these things.<verse eID="Gen.24.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.29" sID="Gen.24.29"/>Now Rebekka had a brother whose name was Laban. And Laban ran out to the man at the well.<verse eID="Gen.24.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.30" sID="Gen.24.30"/>When he saw the ear rings and bracelets in his sister's hands and heard all the words of Rebekka his sister, saying, Thus spake the man to me, he went to the man who was standing by his camels at the well<verse eID="Gen.24.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.31" sID="Gen.24.31"/>and said to him, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord, why hast thou tarried without? I have the house ready and a place for the camels.<verse eID="Gen.24.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.32" sID="Gen.24.32"/>So the man went in to the family, and Laban unsaddled the camels, and gave straw and provender to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him,<verse eID="Gen.24.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.33" sID="Gen.24.33"/>and set bread before them to eat. But the man said I cannot eat till I have told my business. And Laban said, speak.<verse eID="Gen.24.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.34" sID="Gen.24.34"/>Thereupon the man said, I am Abraham's servant,<verse eID="Gen.24.34"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.35" sID="Gen.24.35"/>The Lord indeed hath blessed my master exceedingly, so that he is be 35 come great. He hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold, men
servants and maid servants, camels and asses.<verse eID="Gen.24.35"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.36" sID="Gen.24.36"/>And Sarah, the wife of my master, hath born one son to my master when he was old, and he hath given him all that belonged to him.<verse eID="Gen.24.36"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.37" sID="Gen.24.37"/>And my master made me sware saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son from among the daughters of the Chananites in whose land I sojourn;<verse eID="Gen.24.37"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.38" sID="Gen.24.38"/>but thou shalt go to the house of my father and to my tribe and take thence a wife for my son.<verse eID="Gen.24.38"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.39" sID="Gen.24.39"/>Whereupon I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not come with me.<verse eID="Gen.24.39"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.40" sID="Gen.24.40"/>And he said to me, The Lord God, to whom I have been well pleasing in his
sight, will send his angel with thee, and make thy journey prosperous, and thou
shalt take a wife for my son from my tribe and from my father's house.<verse eID="Gen.24.40"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.41" sID="Gen.24.41"/>On this condition only thou shalt be absolved from my curse; when thou hast gone to my tribe, if they will not give thee, then shalt thou be clear from my oath.<verse eID="Gen.24.41"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.42" sID="Gen.24.42"/>Now, when I came to day to the well, I said, Lord the God of my master Abraham, if thou prosperest the journey in which I am now engaged,<verse eID="Gen.24.42"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.43" sID="Gen.24.43"/>Behold I have stopped at this well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water, Let the virgin to whom I shall say, Let me drink a little water out of thy pitcher;<verse eID="Gen.24.43"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.44" sID="Gen.24.44"/>and who shall say to me, Drink thou, and I will draw water for thy camels; Let her be the wife whom the Lord hath provided for his servant Isaak; and by this I shall know that thon hast dealt mercifully with my master Abraham.<verse eID="Gen.24.44"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.45" sID="Gen.24.45"/>And before I had finished this my address in thought, straightway Rebekka came with the pitcher on her shoulder and went down to the well and drew water, and I said to her, Let me drink.<verse eID="Gen.24.45"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.46" sID="Gen.24.46"/>Upon which she speedily let down the pitcher on Her arm, and said, Drink thou, and I will water thy camels. So I drank. And when she had watered the camels,<verse eID="Gen.24.46"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.47" sID="Gen.24.47"/>I asked her saying, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me. And she said, I am the daughter of Bathuel the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him. Then I put the ear rings on her and the bracelets on her hands,<verse eID="Gen.24.47"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.48" sID="Gen.24.48"/>and being well pleased, I worshipped the Lord and blessed the Lord the God of my master Abraham, who had prospered me in the right way to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.<verse eID="Gen.24.48"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.49" sID="Gen.24.49"/>Now therefore, if you deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me; that I may turn either to the right or left.<verse eID="Gen.24.49"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.50" sID="Gen.24.50"/>In reply to which, Laban and Bathuel said, This matter hath proceeded from the Lord. We cannot gainsay thee, be it good or bad.<verse eID="Gen.24.50"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.51" sID="Gen.24.51"/>Behold Rebekka is before thee. Take her and go and let her be the wife of thy master's son, as the Lord hath spoken.<verse eID="Gen.24.51"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.52" sID="Gen.24.52"/>And when Abraham's servant heard these words, he worshipped the Lord on the ground.<verse eID="Gen.24.52"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.53" sID="Gen.24.53"/>Then the servant brought out jewels of silver and gold and raiment and gave them to Rebekka, and made presents to her brother and to her mother.<verse eID="Gen.24.53"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.54" sID="Gen.24.54"/>And when he and the men who were with him had eaten and drank, they went to rest. And he arose early next morning and said, Dismiss me that I may return to my master.<verse eID="Gen.24.54"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.55" sID="Gen.24.55"/>But her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel stay with us about ten days and then she shall go.<verse eID="Gen.24.55"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.56" sID="Gen.24.56"/>And he said to them, Do not detain me, seeing the Lord hath prospered my journey as far as it respecteth me. Send me away that I may go back to my master.<verse eID="Gen.24.56"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.57" sID="Gen.24.57"/>Whereupon they said, Let us call our child and ask what she saith.<verse eID="Gen.24.57"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.58" sID="Gen.24.58"/>So they called Rebekka and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And
she said, I will go.<verse eID="Gen.24.58"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.59" sID="Gen.24.59"/>Then they sent away their sister Rebekka and what belonged to her, and the servant of Abraham and his attendants.<verse eID="Gen.24.59"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.60" sID="Gen.24.60"/>And they blessed Rebekka and said to her, Thou art our sister. Mayest thou become thousands of myriads and may thy seed inherit the cities of their enemies.<verse eID="Gen.24.60"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.61" sID="Gen.24.61"/>Then arose Rebekka and her maids, and mounting the camels they went with the man. And the servant took Rebekka and departed.<verse eID="Gen.24.61"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.62" sID="Gen.24.62"/>Now Isaak had travelled through the wilderness to the well of Vision, and dwelt in the south country.<verse eID="Gen.24.62"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.63" sID="Gen.24.63"/>And in the evening Isaak went out into the plain to meditate; and raising his eyes he saw camels coming.<verse eID="Gen.24.63"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.64" sID="Gen.24.64"/>Rebekka also having raised her eyes, saw Isaak and alighted from her camel.<verse eID="Gen.24.64"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.65" sID="Gen.24.65"/>She had said to the servant, What man is that coming in the plain to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. Whereupon she took her veil and covered herself.<verse eID="Gen.24.65"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.66" sID="Gen.24.66"/>And the servant told Isaak all that he had done.<verse eID="Gen.24.66"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.24.67" sID="Gen.24.67"/>And Isaak went to his mother's house and took Rebekka, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaak was comforted for the loss of his mother Sarah.<verse eID="Gen.24.67"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.24"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.25" sID="Gen.25"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.1" sID="Gen.25.1"/>Now Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Chettura<verse eID="Gen.25.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.2" sID="Gen.25.2"/>and she bore to him Zembran and Jesan and Madal and Madiam and Jesbok and Soie.<verse eID="Gen.25.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.3" sID="Gen.25.3"/>And Jesan begat Saba and Dedan. And the children of Dedan were Assurieim and Latusieim and Laomeim.<verse eID="Gen.25.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.4" sID="Gen.25.4"/>And the children of Madiam were Gephar and Apheir and Enoch and Abeida and Eldaga. All these were children of Chettura.<verse eID="Gen.25.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.5" sID="Gen.25.5"/>But Abraham gave to his son Isaak all his possessions,<verse eID="Gen.25.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.6" sID="Gen.25.6"/>and to the children of his concubines Abraham gave gifts and sent them, while he was yet living, towards the east, into the eastern country from his
son Isaak.<verse eID="Gen.25.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.7" sID="Gen.25.7"/>Now these were the years of the days of Abraham's life which he lived, one hundred and seventy five years.<verse eID="Gen.25.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.8" sID="Gen.25.8"/>And Abraham declining died in a good old age, an old man and full of days and he was added to his people.<verse eID="Gen.25.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.9" sID="Gen.25.9"/>And his sons Isaak and Ismael buried him in the double cave in the field of Ephron the son of Saar the Chettite, which is over against Mambre—<verse eID="Gen.25.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.10" sID="Gen.25.10"/>in the field and the cave which Abraham bought of the children of Chet, there they buried Abraham with Sarah his wife.<verse eID="Gen.25.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.11" sID="Gen.25.11"/>And after the death of Abraham God blessed his son Isaak; and Isaak dwelt at the well of Vision.<verse eID="Gen.25.11"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.12" sID="Gen.25.12"/>Now these are the generations of Abraham's son Ismael whom Agar the Egyptian, Sarah's maid, bore to Abraham;<verse eID="Gen.25.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.13" sID="Gen.25.13"/>and these are the names of the children of Ismael according to the names of his families. The first born of Ismael was Nabaioth, then Kedar and Nabdael and Massam<verse eID="Gen.25.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.14" sID="Gen.25.14"/>and Masma and Duma and Masse<verse eID="Gen.25.14"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.25.16" sID="Gen.25.16"/>These are the children of Ismael and these are their names in their tents and in their habitations; twelve chiefs of their respective nations.<verse eID="Gen.25.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.17" sID="Gen.25.17"/>And these were the years of the life of Ismael, one hundred and thirty
seven years, and he declining died and was added to his race.<verse eID="Gen.25.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.18" sID="Gen.25.18"/>Now he inhabited the country from Evilat to Sour which is in front of Egypt, all the way to the Assyrians. In front of all his brethren was his habitation.<verse eID="Gen.25.18"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.19" sID="Gen.25.19"/>And these are the generations of Isaak the son of Abraham.</p>
<p>
Abraham begot Isaak.<verse eID="Gen.25.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.20" sID="Gen.25.20"/>And Isaak was forty years old when he took to wife Rebekka the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian of Syro Mesopotamia the sister of Laban the Syrian.<verse eID="Gen.25.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.21" sID="Gen.25.21"/>And Isaak intreated the Lord for Rebekka his wife because she was barren, and the Lord hearkened to him; And Rebekka his wife conceived<verse eID="Gen.25.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.22" sID="Gen.25.22"/>and the children struggled within her and she said; If it is to be so with me, what doth this portend? So she went to inquire of the Lord.<verse eID="Gen.25.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.23" sID="Gen.25.23"/>And the Lord said to her, two nations are in thy womb and two peoples
shall be separated from thy belly, and the one people will excel the other and the elder shall serve the younger.<verse eID="Gen.25.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.24" sID="Gen.25.24"/>So when her days to be delivered were fulfilled there were twins in her womb.<verse eID="Gen.25.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.25" sID="Gen.25.25"/>And the first born came forth red all over hairy like a hide and she called his name Esau;<verse eID="Gen.25.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.26" sID="Gen.25.26"/>and after that came forth his brother and his hand had hold of Esau's heel, and she called his name Jacob. Now Isaak was sixty years old when Rebekka bore them.<verse eID="Gen.25.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.27" sID="Gen.25.27"/>And when they grew up to be young men, Esau was a man skilled in hunting and fond of the field; but Jacob was a man of plain manners and lived at home.<verse eID="Gen.25.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.28" sID="Gen.25.28"/>And Isaak loved Esau, because his game was his food; But Rebekka loved Jacob.<verse eID="Gen.25.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.29" sID="Gen.25.29"/>Now when Jacob was boiling pottage Esau came from the field fainty.<verse eID="Gen.25.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.30" sID="Gen.25.30"/>And Esau said to Jacob, Let me taste some of that red pottage, for I am fainty. For this cause his name was called Edom.<verse eID="Gen.25.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.31" sID="Gen.25.31"/>And Jacob said to Esau, give me this day in exchange thy rights of primogeniture.<verse eID="Gen.25.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.32" sID="Gen.25.32"/>And Esau said, Lo! I am going to die, what then are these rights of primogeniture to me?<verse eID="Gen.25.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.33" sID="Gen.25.33"/>And Jacob said to him, Swear now to me. So he swore to him. Thus were Esau's rights of primogeniture transferred to Jacob.<verse eID="Gen.25.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.25.34" sID="Gen.25.34"/>Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil pottage. And when he had eaten and drunk he arose and went away. Thus did Esau undervalue the rights of primogeniture.<verse eID="Gen.25.34"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.25"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.26" sID="Gen.26"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.1" sID="Gen.26.1"/>Now there had been a famine in the land besides the former famine which happened in the time of Abraham. And Isaak went to Abimelech the king of the Philistines, to Gerar.<verse eID="Gen.26.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.2" sID="Gen.26.2"/>For the Lord had appeared to him and said, Go not down into Egypt, but dwell in the land which I will tell thee.<verse eID="Gen.26.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.3" sID="Gen.26.3"/>Sojourn in this land and I will be with thee and bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed I will give all this land. And I will establish my oath which I
sware to thy father Abraham<verse eID="Gen.26.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.4" sID="Gen.26.4"/>and multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven. And to thy seed I will give all this land; and by thy seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;<verse eID="Gen.26.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.5" sID="Gen.26.5"/>because Abraham thy father hearkened to my voice and kept my ordinances and my commandments and my rules of rectitude and my rites.<verse eID="Gen.26.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.6" sID="Gen.26.6"/>And while Isaak dwelt at Gerar<verse eID="Gen.26.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.7" sID="Gen.26.7"/>the men of the place made inquiry respecting his wife Rebekka; and he
said, She is my sister, for he was afraid to say, She is my wife, lest peradventure the men of the place should kill him for Sebeka"s sake, for she was of a very beautiful countenance.<verse eID="Gen.26.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.8" sID="Gen.26.8"/>However he continued there a long time; for Abimelech king of the Gerarites happening to look through a window saw Isaak dallying with Rebekka his wife.<verse eID="Gen.26.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.9" sID="Gen.26.9"/>Whereupon Abimelech called Isaak and said to him certainly she is thy wife. Why then didst thou say, She is my sister? And Isaak said to him, Because I thought I might perhaps die for her.<verse eID="Gen.26.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.10" sID="Gen.26.10"/>And Abimelech said to him, Why hast thou dealt thus with us? In a little while some person of my family might have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guilt upon us through ignorance.<verse eID="Gen.26.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.11" sID="Gen.26.11"/>Then Abimelech gave a strict charge to all his people saying, Whoever toucheth this man or his wife shall be liable to death.<verse eID="Gen.26.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.12" sID="Gen.26.12"/>And Isaak sowed in that land and got that year an hundred fold of barley. And the Lord blessed him<verse eID="Gen.26.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.13" sID="Gen.26.13"/>and the man was exalted and prospered more and more till he became exceeding great.<verse eID="Gen.26.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.14" sID="Gen.26.14"/>And he had flocks and herds of cattle and many fields under cultivation. And the Philistines envied him;<verse eID="Gen.26.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.15" sID="Gen.26.15"/>and all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the time of his father, the Philistines stopped up and filled them with earth.<verse eID="Gen.26.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.16" sID="Gen.26.16"/>And Abimelech said to Isaak, Depart from us, for thou art become far mightier than we.<verse eID="Gen.26.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.17" sID="Gen.26.17"/>Upon this Isaak departed thence and took up his abode in the valley of Gerar and dwelt there.<verse eID="Gen.26.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.18" sID="Gen.26.18"/>And Isaak digged again the wells of water, which the servants of his father Abraham had digged and which the Philistines had stopped up, after the death of his father Abraham. And he called them by the same names, by which his father had named them.<verse eID="Gen.26.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.19" sID="Gen.26.19"/>Isaak's servants also digged in the valley of Gerar, and found there a well of spring water.<verse eID="Gen.26.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.20" sID="Gen.26.20"/>But the shepherds of the Gerarites contended with Isaak's shepherds,
saying the water was theirs. So he called the name of that well Injustice: because they did him injustice.<verse eID="Gen.26.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.21" sID="Gen.26.21"/>Then he removed thence and digged another well; and about this also they contended; so he called its name Enmity.<verse eID="Gen.26.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.22" sID="Gen.26.22"/>And he removed thence and digged another well; and about this they did not contend; So he called the name of it, Room-enough; saying, For now the Lord hath made room for us, though he hath increased us in the land.<verse eID="Gen.26.22"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.23" sID="Gen.26.23"/>And he went up thence to Well of the Oath;<verse eID="Gen.26.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.24" sID="Gen.26.24"/>and the Lord appeared to him that night and said, I am the God of thy father Abraham; Fear not; for I am with thee; and I will bless thee and multiply thy seed for the sake of thy father Abraham.<verse eID="Gen.26.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.25" sID="Gen.26.25"/>So he built there an altar and invoked the name of the Lord and fixed his tent there. And while the servants of Isaak were digging a well there in the valley of Gerar,<verse eID="Gen.26.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.26" sID="Gen.26.26"/>Abimelech came to him from Gerar, accompanied with Ochozath his chamberlain and Phichol the general of his army.<verse eID="Gen.26.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.27" sID="Gen.26.27"/>And Isaak said to them, Why are you come to me, seeing you have hated me and sent me away from you?<verse eID="Gen.26.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.28" sID="Gen.26.28"/>And they said, We saw plainly that the Lord is with thee; therefore we
said, Let there be an oath between us and thee; and we will make a covenant with thee<verse eID="Gen.26.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.29" sID="Gen.26.29"/>that thou wilt not do us an injury, as we have not hated thee but used thee well and sent thee away in peace, and thou art now blessed of the Lord.<verse eID="Gen.26.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.30" sID="Gen.26.30"/>Then he made an entertainment for them and they ate and drank.<verse eID="Gen.26.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.31" sID="Gen.26.31"/>And early next morning they arose and swore one to the other. And Isaak dismissed them and they departed from him in peace.<verse eID="Gen.26.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.32" sID="Gen.26.32"/>And it happened that on that very day the servants of Isaak came and told him of the well which they had been digging and said, We have found water.<verse eID="Gen.26.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.33" sID="Gen.26.33"/>So he called it, Oath. For this cause they call the name of the city, Well of Oath, even at this day.<verse eID="Gen.26.33"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.34" sID="Gen.26.34"/>Now when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith, the daughter of Beoch the Chettite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Chettite,<verse eID="Gen.26.34"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.26.35" sID="Gen.26.35"/>and they were at strife with Isaak and Rebekka.<verse eID="Gen.26.35"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.26"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.27" sID="Gen.27"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.1" sID="Gen.27.1"/>And after Isaak grew old, when his eyes were so dimmed that he could not
see he called Esau his eldest son and said to him. My Son. And he said here I am.<verse eID="Gen.27.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.2" sID="Gen.27.2"/>And he said, Behold I am grown old and do not know the day of my dissolution;<verse eID="Gen.27.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.3" sID="Gen.27.3"/>now therefore take thy arms—the quiver and the bow; and go out into the field and hunt game for me<verse eID="Gen.27.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.4" sID="Gen.27.4"/>and make me savory meat such as I love and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.<verse eID="Gen.27.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.5" sID="Gen.27.5"/>Now Rebekka heard Isaak speaking to his son Esau. So when Esau was gone to the field to hunt game for his father,<verse eID="Gen.27.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.6" sID="Gen.27.6"/>Rebekka said to Jacob her younger son. Lo! I heard thy father speaking to thy brother Esau saying,<verse eID="Gen.27.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.7" sID="Gen.27.7"/>Bring me game and make me savory meat that I may eat and bless thee in the presence of the Lord before I die.<verse eID="Gen.27.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.8" sID="Gen.27.8"/>Now therefore, my son, hearken to me as I command thee,<verse eID="Gen.27.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.9" sID="Gen.27.9"/>and go to the flock and fetch me thence two kids tender and good, and I will make them savory meat for thy father such as he loveth<verse eID="Gen.27.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.10" sID="Gen.27.10"/>and thou shalt carry it to thy father that he may eat; that thy father may bless thee before he die.<verse eID="Gen.27.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.11" sID="Gen.27.11"/>And Jacob said to his mother Rebekka, My brother Esau is a hairy man and I am a smooth man.<verse eID="Gen.27.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.12" sID="Gen.27.12"/>Perhaps my father may feel me, and I shall be before him as a deceiver,
so I shall bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing.<verse eID="Gen.27.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.13" sID="Gen.27.13"/>And his mother said to him, Upon me, my son, be thy curse. Only hearken to my voice; and go and bring me them.<verse eID="Gen.27.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.14" sID="Gen.27.14"/>So he went and took and brought them to his mother; and his mother made
savory meat such as his father loved.<verse eID="Gen.27.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.15" sID="Gen.27.15"/>And Rebekka took the robe of Esau her eldest son, the robe of dignity which was with her in the house and put it on her younger son Jacob.<verse eID="Gen.27.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.16" sID="Gen.27.16"/>And she put the skins of the kids on his arms and the naked parts of his neck;<verse eID="Gen.27.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.17" sID="Gen.27.17"/>and gave the savory meat and cakes which she had baked, into the hands of her son Jacob;<verse eID="Gen.27.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.18" sID="Gen.27.18"/>and he took them to his father and said, Father! And he said, Here I am. Who art thou, my son?<verse eID="Gen.27.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.19" sID="Gen.27.19"/>And Jacob said to his father. I am Esau, thy first born. I have done as thou badest me. Arise, sit up, and eat of my game that thy soul may bless me.<verse eID="Gen.27.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.20" sID="Gen.27.20"/>And Isaak said to his son, What is this, my son, which thou hast found so quickly? And he said, It is what the Lord thy God presented to my view.<verse eID="Gen.27.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.21" sID="Gen.27.21"/>And Isaak said to Jacob, Come near my son and let me feel thee, whether thou be my son Esau or not.<verse eID="Gen.27.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.22" sID="Gen.27.22"/>And Jacob went near to his father Isaak. And when he had felt him he
said, The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.<verse eID="Gen.27.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.23" sID="Gen.27.23"/>So he did not discover him, because his hands were hairy like the hands of his brother Esau, when he blessed him.<verse eID="Gen.27.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.24" sID="Gen.27.24"/>Then he said. Art thou my son Esau? And he said; I am.<verse eID="Gen.27.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.25" sID="Gen.27.25"/>And he said, Bring it near to me and I will eat of thy game, my son, that my soul may bless thee. So he brought it near to him and he ate. And he brought wine and he drank.<verse eID="Gen.27.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.26" sID="Gen.27.26"/>And Isaak his father said to him, Come near me my son and kiss me.<verse eID="Gen.27.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.27" sID="Gen.27.27"/>And when he came near and kissed him; he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said, Behold the fragrance of my son is like the fragrance of a full field which the Lord hath blessed.<verse eID="Gen.27.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.28" sID="Gen.27.28"/>Therefore God give thee from the dew of heaven and from the fatness of the land plenty of corn and wine.<verse eID="Gen.27.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.29" sID="Gen.27.29"/>May nations serve thee; and princes bow down to thee. Be thou lord of thy brother. And let the children of thy father pay thee homage. Cursed be he who curseth thee; and let him who blesseth thee be blessed.<verse eID="Gen.27.29"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.30" sID="Gen.27.30"/>Now after Isaak had finished blessing his son Jacob, when Jacob had but just withdrawn from the presence of his father Isaak, Esau his brother came from the chace.<verse eID="Gen.27.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.31" sID="Gen.27.31"/>He also had made savory meat and he brought it to his father and said to him, Arise my father and eat thy son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.<verse eID="Gen.27.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.32" sID="Gen.27.32"/>And Isaak his father said to him, Who art thou? And he said I am thy son, thy first born Esau.<verse eID="Gen.27.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.33" sID="Gen.27.33"/>Then was Isaak absorpt in great amazement and said, Who then is he who hath hunted game and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before thou earnest and have blessed him, and he will be blessed.<verse eID="Gen.27.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.34" sID="Gen.27.34"/>And when Esau heard the words of his father Isaak he cried with a loud and very bitter cry and said, Bless, I beseech thee, me also, Father.<verse eID="Gen.27.34"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.35" sID="Gen.27.35"/>And he said to him, Thy brother hath come deceitfully and taken thy blessing.<verse eID="Gen.27.35"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.36" sID="Gen.27.36"/>And Esau said, His name is rightly called Jacob; for lo! he hath now
supplanted me a second time. He took from me my rights of primogeniture; and now he hath taken my blessing. Then Esau said to his father, Hast thou not, father, reserved a blessing for me?<verse eID="Gen.27.36"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.37" sID="Gen.27.37"/>And Isaak in reply said to Esau, Seeing I have made him thy lord and made all his brethren his servants and have also supported him with corn and wine, what can I do for thee, my son?<verse eID="Gen.27.37"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.38" sID="Gen.27.38"/>And Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, father? Bless, I beseech thee, me also, father. And Isaak being deeply affected, Esau raised his voice and wept.<verse eID="Gen.27.38"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.39" sID="Gen.27.39"/>And Isaak his father answered and said to him, Behold thy dwelling shall border on the fatness of the earth and on the dew of heaven from above.<verse eID="Gen.27.39"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.40" sID="Gen.27.40"/>By thy sword thou shalt live and thou shalt serve thy brother. But the time will come when thou mayst shake off and loose his yoke from thy neck.<verse eID="Gen.27.40"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.41" sID="Gen.27.41"/>So Esau harboured a rooted hatred against Jacob on account of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. And in this agitation of his mind Esau said, O! that, the days of mourning for my father were come that I may kill my brother Jacob.<verse eID="Gen.27.41"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.42" sID="Gen.27.42"/>And when the words of Esau her eldest son were told to Rebekka she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, Behold thy brother Esau threateneth to kill thee.<verse eID="Gen.27.42"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.43" sID="Gen.27.43"/>Now therefore, my son, hearken to my voice and arise and flee to Mesopotamia to my brother Laban at Charran,<verse eID="Gen.27.43"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.44" sID="Gen.27.44"/>and dwell with him for some time till the fury<verse eID="Gen.27.44"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.45" sID="Gen.27.45"/>and the anger of thy brother turn away from thee, and until he forget what thou hast done to him, then I will send for thee from that place. Perhaps I may be bereaved of you both in one day.<verse eID="Gen.27.45"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.27.46" sID="Gen.27.46"/>Then Rebekka said to Isaak, I am weary of my life on account of the daughters of the children of Chet. If Jacob should take a wife of the daughters of this land what would life be to me?<verse eID="Gen.27.46"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.27"/>

<p type="x-nobreak">
<verse osisID="Gen.28.1" sID="Gen.28.1"/>Upon this Isaak called Jacob to him and blessed him and charged him

<verse osisID="Gen.28.2" sID="Gen.28.2"/>Arise and go to Mesopotamia and to the house of Bathuel thy mother's father, and take thence a wife for thyself of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.<verse eID="Gen.28.2"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.29.1" sID="Gen.29.1"/>Then Jacob proceeded on, and went to the land of the east to Laban the son of Bathuel, the Syrian, the brother of Rebekka who was Jacob and Esau's mother.<verse eID="Gen.29.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.2" sID="Gen.29.2"/>And looking, he saw a well in the plain and there were three flocks of

<verse osisID="Gen.29.8" sID="Gen.29.8"/>But they said, We cannot, till all the shepherds are come together. Then they will roll the stone from the mouth of the well; and we will water the flocks.<verse eID="Gen.29.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.9" sID="Gen.29.9"/>While he was yet speaking with them, lo! Rachel the daughter of Laban came with her father's sheep; for she tended her father's flock.<verse eID="Gen.29.9"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.29.16" sID="Gen.29.16"/>Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the eldest was Leia; and the name of the youngest, Rachel.<verse eID="Gen.29.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.17" sID="Gen.29.17"/>Leia's eyes were weak, but Rachel was of a beautiful countenance, and a very comely person.<verse eID="Gen.29.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.18" sID="Gen.29.18"/>And Jacob loved Rachel, therefore he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy youngest daughter.<verse eID="Gen.29.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.19" sID="Gen.29.19"/>And Laban said to him, It is better for me to give her to thee than to give her to another man. Abide with me.<verse eID="Gen.29.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.20" sID="Gen.29.20"/>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they appeared to him as a few days, because he loved her.<verse eID="Gen.29.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.21" sID="Gen.29.21"/>Then Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for the days are completed, that I may go in unto her.<verse eID="Gen.29.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.22" sID="Gen.29.22"/>Whereupon Laban collected all the men of the place, and made a wedding feast.<verse eID="Gen.29.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.23" sID="Gen.29.23"/>And in the evening he took his daughter Leia and brought her to Jacob; and Jacob went in unto her.<verse eID="Gen.29.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.24" sID="Gen.29.24"/>And Laban gave his maid Zelpha to his daughter Leia, to be her handmaid.<verse eID="Gen.29.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.25" sID="Gen.29.25"/>And in the morning, when Jacob saw it was Leia, he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done to me? Did I not serve thee for Rachel? Why then hast thou deceived me?<verse eID="Gen.29.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.26" sID="Gen.29.26"/>And Laban answered, It is not customary with us in this place to give the younger before the elder.<verse eID="Gen.29.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.27" sID="Gen.29.27"/>Finish therefore this one's week, and I will give thee the other for the
service which thou mayst perform for me yet other seven years.<verse eID="Gen.29.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.28" sID="Gen.29.28"/>And Jacob did so. And when he had finished this one's week, Laban gave him to wife his daughter Rachel;<verse eID="Gen.29.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.29" sID="Gen.29.29"/>and Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, his maid Balla to be her handmaid.<verse eID="Gen.29.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.30" sID="Gen.29.30"/>And Jacob went in unto Rachel, and loved Rachel more than Leia, and
served him other seven years.<verse eID="Gen.29.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.31" sID="Gen.29.31"/>Now when the Lord God saw that Leia was slighted, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.<verse eID="Gen.29.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.32" sID="Gen.29.32"/>And Leia conceived and bore Jacob a son and called his name Reuben;
saying, Because the Lord hath seen my affliction; therefore he hath given me a
son. Now therefore my husband will love me.<verse eID="Gen.29.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.33" sID="Gen.29.33"/>And she conceived again, and bore to Jacob another son, and said, Because the Lord hath heard that I am slighted, he hath given me this son also; so she called his name Symeon.<verse eID="Gen.29.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.34" sID="Gen.29.34"/>And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, Now will my husband abide with me for I have born him three sons; therefore she called his name Levi.<verse eID="Gen.29.34"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.29.35" sID="Gen.29.35"/>And she conceived again and bore a son and said, Now for this also I will praise the Lord, therefore she called his name Judas. Then she ceased from bearing.<verse eID="Gen.29.35"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.29"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.30" sID="Gen.30"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.1" sID="Gen.30.1"/>Now when Rachel saw that she bore no children to Jacob, she envied her
sister and said to Jacob, Give me children, else I shall die.<verse eID="Gen.30.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.2" sID="Gen.30.2"/>And Jacob was angry with Rachel and said to her, Am I in God's stead, who hath deprived thee of the fruit of the womb?<verse eID="Gen.30.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.3" sID="Gen.30.3"/>Then Rachel said to Jacobs There is my maid Balla; go in unto her, and she
shall bring forth on my knees, so I also shall be supplied with children by her means.<verse eID="Gen.30.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.4" sID="Gen.30.4"/>So she gave him her maid Balla for a wife: and Jacob went in unto her,<verse eID="Gen.30.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.5" sID="Gen.30.5"/>And Balla Rachel"s maid conceived and bore Jacob a son.<verse eID="Gen.30.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.6" sID="Gen.30.6"/>And Rachel said, God hath judged for me and hath heard my voice and given me a son: for this cause she called his name Dan.<verse eID="Gen.30.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.7" sID="Gen.30.7"/>And Balla, Rachel"s maid conceived again and bore to Jacob another son.<verse eID="Gen.30.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.8" sID="Gen.30.8"/>Whereupon Rachel said, God helped me when I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed. So she called his name Nephthaleim.<verse eID="Gen.30.8"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.9" sID="Gen.30.9"/>Now when Leia saw that she had ceased from bearing, she also took her maid Zelpha and gave her to Jacob for a wife, and he went in unto her.<verse eID="Gen.30.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.10" sID="Gen.30.10"/>And Zelpha, Leia's maid conceived and bore Jacob a son.<verse eID="Gen.30.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.11" sID="Gen.30.11"/>Whereupon Leia said, Good luck. So she called his name Gad.<verse eID="Gen.30.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.12" sID="Gen.30.12"/>And Zelpha, Leia's maid conceived again and bore Jacob another son.<verse eID="Gen.30.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.13" sID="Gen.30.13"/>Upon which Leia said, Happy am I; for the women will call me happy. So
she called his name Aser.<verse eID="Gen.30.13"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.14" sID="Gen.30.14"/>And at the time of the wheat harvest, Reuben went out and found in the field mandragore apples and brought them to his mother Leia. And Rachel said to her sister Leia, Give me some of thy son's mandragores.<verse eID="Gen.30.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.15" sID="Gen.30.15"/>And Leia said, Is it not enough for thee that thou hast taken my husband? wouldst thou take also my son's mandragores? And Rachel said, Shall I not have them on this condition? Let him be with thee to night for thy son's mandragores.<verse eID="Gen.30.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.16" sID="Gen.30.16"/>So when Jacob was coming from the field in the evening, Leia went out to meet him and said, Thou must come in to me today; for I have hired thee for my
son's mandragores. And he lay with her that night,<verse eID="Gen.30.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.17" sID="Gen.30.17"/>and God hearkened to Leia and she having conceived bore to Jacob a fifth
son.<verse eID="Gen.30.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.18" sID="Gen.30.18"/>And Leia said, God hath given me my reward for having given my maid to my husband. So she called his name Issachar, that is Reward.<verse eID="Gen.30.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.19" sID="Gen.30.19"/>And Leia conceived again and bore a sixth son to Jacob.<verse eID="Gen.30.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.20" sID="Gen.30.20"/>Whereupon Leia said, God hath now endowed me with a good dowry. My husband will make choice of me, for I have born him six sons. So she called his name Zabulon.<verse eID="Gen.30.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.21" sID="Gen.30.21"/>And after this she bore a daughter and called her name Deina.<verse eID="Gen.30.21"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.22" sID="Gen.30.22"/>Now God had remembered Rachel and God hearkened to her and opened her womb.<verse eID="Gen.30.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.23" sID="Gen.30.23"/>And she having conceived bore Jacob a son. Whereupon she said, God hath taken away my reproach.<verse eID="Gen.30.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.24" sID="Gen.30.24"/>So she called his name Joseph, saying, May God add to me another son.<verse eID="Gen.30.24"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.25" sID="Gen.30.25"/>And when Rachel had born Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my own country.<verse eID="Gen.30.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.26" sID="Gen.30.26"/>Give me up my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, that I may go away: for thou knowest the service which I have done thee.<verse eID="Gen.30.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.27" sID="Gen.30.27"/>Upon which Laban said to him, If I have found favour in thy sight, I would avert this evil: for God hath blessed me by thy coming.<verse eID="Gen.30.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.28" sID="Gen.30.28"/>State to me thy wages and I will give it.<verse eID="Gen.30.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.29" sID="Gen.30.29"/>And Jacob said, Thou knowest what service I have done thee, and how many cattle belonging to thee are now with me.<verse eID="Gen.30.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.30" sID="Gen.30.30"/>Thy stock was small before I came; but it is increased to a multitude, and the Lord hath blessed thee by my attendance. Now then, when shall I provide a house for myself.<verse eID="Gen.30.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.31" sID="Gen.30.31"/>And Laban said, What shall I give thee? To which Jacob replied, Thou
shalt not give me any thing. If thou wilt do this for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep watch.<verse eID="Gen.30.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.32" sID="Gen.30.32"/>Let all thy flocks this day pass in review and separate thou from them every grizly sheep among the lambs, and every one speckled and spotted among the goats. Such shall be my hire<verse eID="Gen.30.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.33" sID="Gen.30.33"/>and my righteousness shall answer for me in time to come; for my wages are apparent to thee. Whatever is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and grizly among the sheep, if found with me, let it be deemed stolen.<verse eID="Gen.30.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.34" sID="Gen.30.34"/>And Laban said to him, Let it be according to thy proposal.<verse eID="Gen.30.34"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.35" sID="Gen.30.35"/>And that very day he separated the goats which were speckled and spotted, both male and female, and every one among the lambs which was grizly and every one in which there was a mixture of white, and delivered them into the hands of his sons,<verse eID="Gen.30.35"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.36" sID="Gen.30.36"/>and set three days journey between them and Jacob. And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.<verse eID="Gen.30.36"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.37" sID="Gen.30.37"/>And Jacob took him rods of the styrax and almond and plane-tree and peeled off the white bark, and twisting it round the green, the white which he peeled off appeared speckled.<verse eID="Gen.30.37"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.38" sID="Gen.30.38"/>And he placed the rods which he had peeled, in the watering troughs, in order that, when the flocks came to drink, they might engender at the rods, while they were drinking, with the rods in view.<verse eID="Gen.30.38"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.39" sID="Gen.30.39"/>So the flocks engendered at the rods and brought forth cattle streaked and spotted and ash coloured.<verse eID="Gen.30.39"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.40" sID="Gen.30.40"/>And when Jacob had separated the lambs and placed before the ewes a
spotted ram and all that had spots among the lambs, then he kept the flocks which were for himself apart by themselves and did not mix them with the flocks of Laban.<verse eID="Gen.30.40"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.41" sID="Gen.30.41"/>And at the season when the sheep were engendering and conceiving, Jacob put the rods in the troughs before some, that they might engender before the rods;<verse eID="Gen.30.41"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.42" sID="Gen.30.42"/>but before others that had lambed he did not place them. Thus the indifferent became Laban's but the choicest were Jacob's.<verse eID="Gen.30.42"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.30.43" sID="Gen.30.43"/>And the man became very rich and had much cattle and herds and men
servants and maid servants and camels and asses.<verse eID="Gen.30.43"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.30"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.31.1" sID="Gen.31.1"/>And Jacob heard the words of Laban's sons saying, Jacob hath taken all that belonged to our father, and with our father's substance he hath acquired all this glory.<verse eID="Gen.31.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.2" sID="Gen.31.2"/>And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and lo! it was not towards him as heretofore.</p>
<p><verse eID="Gen.31.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.3" sID="Gen.31.3"/>Then the Lord said to Jacob, Return to thy father's land and to thy kindred and I will be with thee.<verse eID="Gen.31.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.4" sID="Gen.31.4"/>Thereupon Jacob sent for Leia and Rachel to the field where the flocks were<verse eID="Gen.31.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.5" sID="Gen.31.5"/>and said to them, I see that the countenance of your father is not towards me as heretofore. Though the God of my father was with me;<verse eID="Gen.31.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.6" sID="Gen.31.6"/>and you also know that with all my ability I have served your father;<verse eID="Gen.31.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.7" sID="Gen.31.7"/>yet your father hath dealt deceitfully with me, and at the ten lambings hath changed my wages. But God suffered him not to hurt me.<verse eID="Gen.31.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.8" sID="Gen.31.8"/>When he said the speckled shall be thy wages, then all the cattle brought forth speckled. And when he said, The white shall be thy wages. Then all the cattle brought forth white.<verse eID="Gen.31.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.9" sID="Gen.31.9"/>So the Lord hath taken all the cattle of your father and given them to me.<verse eID="Gen.31.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.10" sID="Gen.31.10"/>Indeed when the flocks engendered I beheld with my eyes in a dream, and lo! the he-goats and the rams, which leaped upon the sheep and the goats were ring-streaked, spotted and ash coloured.<verse eID="Gen.31.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.11" sID="Gen.31.11"/>Moreover an angel of God said to me in a dream, Jacob! And I said, What is the matter.<verse eID="Gen.31.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.12" sID="Gen.31.12"/>And he said, Lift up thy eyes and behold the he-goats and the rams which are leaping on the sheep and the goats! They are ring-streaked, speckled and ash coloured; for I have seen what Laban is doing to thee.<verse eID="Gen.31.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.13" sID="Gen.31.13"/>I am the God who appeared to thee at the place of God, where thou didst anoint for me a pillar and where thou didst make a vow.

<verse osisID="Gen.31.14" sID="Gen.31.14"/>In reply to which Rachel and Leia said to him, Have we any more a portion or an inheritance in our father's house?<verse eID="Gen.31.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.15" sID="Gen.31.15"/>Are we not accounted by him as strangers? For he hath sold us and spent the money he got for us.<verse eID="Gen.31.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.16" sID="Gen.31.16"/>Now since all the riches and glory which God hath taken from our father
shall be ours and our children's, do then what God hath commanded thee.<verse eID="Gen.31.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.17" sID="Gen.31.17"/>So Jacob arose and put his wives and his children on camels,<verse eID="Gen.31.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.18" sID="Gen.31.18"/>and carried off all his substance, and all the goods which he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and all that belonged to him, to go to his father Isaak in the land of Chanaan.<verse eID="Gen.31.18"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.19" sID="Gen.31.19"/>Now Laban being gone to sheer his sheep, Rachel stole her father's idols.<verse eID="Gen.31.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.20" sID="Gen.31.20"/>And Jacob concealed his design from Laban the Syrian by not telling him that he was going away.<verse eID="Gen.31.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.21" sID="Gen.31.21"/>And he departed with all that belonged to him and crossed the river and bent his course to mount Galaad.<verse eID="Gen.31.21"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.31.25" sID="Gen.31.25"/>Now when Laban overtook Jacob, Jacob had pitched his tent on the mount. So Laban halted his brethren at mount Galaad.<verse eID="Gen.31.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.26" sID="Gen.31.26"/>And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done? Why didst thou flee away

<verse osisID="Gen.31.27" sID="Gen.31.27"/>Hadst thou told me I might have sent thee away with joy and musick, with timbrels and the kithara.<verse eID="Gen.31.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.28" sID="Gen.31.28"/>But I have not been thought worthy to kiss my children and my daughters. Now therefore thou hast acted foolishly;<verse eID="Gen.31.28"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.31.30" sID="Gen.31.30"/>Now grant that thou hast gone because thou hadst a longing desire to return to thy father's house, yet why hast thou stolen my Gods?<verse eID="Gen.31.30"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.31" sID="Gen.31.31"/>In reply to this Jacob said to Laban, I was afraid; for I thought that thou perhaps wouldst take from me thy daughters and all that are mine:<verse eID="Gen.31.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.32" sID="Gen.31.32"/>but said Jacob, with whomsoever thou findest thy Gods, let him not live. In the presence of our brethren, examine what there is of thine with me and take it. He knew of nothing with him. Now Jacob did not know that his wife Rachel had stolen them.<verse eID="Gen.31.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.33" sID="Gen.31.33"/>So when Laban had gone in and searched Leia's tent and found them not; and from Leia's tent had gone and searched the tent of Jacob and in the tent of the two handmaids but did not find them. Then he went in also to Rachel's tent.<verse eID="Gen.31.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.34" sID="Gen.31.34"/>Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them in the camel's furniture and
sat upon them,<verse eID="Gen.31.34"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.35" sID="Gen.31.35"/>and she said to her father, Be not offended my lord, I cannot rise before thee, for the custom of women is upon me. So when Laban had searched the whole tent but did not find the idols,<verse eID="Gen.31.35"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.36" sID="Gen.31.36"/>Jacob was inflamed with resentment and remonstrated against Laban. And Jacob addressing Laban said, What is my crime, and what my offence that thou hast pursued me?<verse eID="Gen.31.36"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.37" sID="Gen.31.37"/>And that thou hast searched all the goods of my house? What hast thou found of all the goods of thy house? Set it here before thy brethren and my brethren and let them judge between us both<verse eID="Gen.31.37"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.38" sID="Gen.31.38"/>These twenty years that I have been with thee, thy sheep and thy goats have not cast their young; nor have I devoured the rams of thy flock.<verse eID="Gen.31.38"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.31.42" sID="Gen.31.42"/>Had not the God of my father Abraham and the fear of Isaak been with me, thou wouldst now have sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction and the labour of my hands, therefore he rebuked thee last night.<verse eID="Gen.31.42"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.43" sID="Gen.31.43"/>In reply to this Laban said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the cattle are my cattle. Even all that thou seest are mine and my daughters. What now can I do to them and their children whom they have born?<verse eID="Gen.31.43"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.44" sID="Gen.31.44"/>Now therefore come and let us make a covenant, both I and thou. And let it be for a memorial between me and thee. And he said to him, Behold there is none with us; God a witness between me and thee hath seen.<verse eID="Gen.31.44"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.45" sID="Gen.31.45"/>Then Jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar.<verse eID="Gen.31.45"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.31.46" sID="Gen.31.46"/>And Jacob said to his brethren, Collect stones. And when they had collected stones and made a heap, they eat thereon. Then Laban said to him, "This heap is this day a witness between me and thee;"<verse eID="Gen.31.46"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.33.11" sID="Gen.33.11"/>Receive these my blessings which I have brought thee; because God hath dealt bountifully with me, and is all things to me. So he pressed him and he took them.<verse eID="Gen.33.11"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.33.14" sID="Gen.33.14"/>Let my lord go on before his servant, and I will recruit them on the way by a leisurely march as fast as the young can walk, until I come to my lord at Seir.<verse eID="Gen.33.14"/>

<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.1" sID="Gen.37.1"/>Now Jacob dwelt in the land where his father had sojourned in the land of Chanaan;<verse eID="Gen.37.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.2" sID="Gen.37.2"/>and this is the history of Jacob's posterity. When Joseph was seventeen years of age and feeding his father's sheep with his brothers, as he was young, namely with the sons of Balla and the sons of Zelpha his father's wives, they carried an ill report against Joseph to Israel their father.<verse eID="Gen.37.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.3" sID="Gen.37.3"/>Now Jacob loved Joseph above all his children because he was the son of his old age; and he had made him a robe of different colours.<verse eID="Gen.37.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.4" sID="Gen.37.4"/>So when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his
sons, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.<verse eID="Gen.37.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.5" sID="Gen.37.5"/>Besides Joseph having dreamed a dream told it to his brothers<verse eID="Gen.37.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.6" sID="Gen.37.6"/>and said to them, Hear this dream which I have dreamed.<verse eID="Gen.37.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.7" sID="Gen.37.7"/>I thought we were binding sheaves in the middle of a field; and my sheaf arose and stood upright, and your sheaves being ranged around made obeisance to my sheaf.<verse eID="Gen.37.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.8" sID="Gen.37.8"/>Upon which his brothers said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us or have dominion over us? So they hated him still more for his dreams and for his words.<verse eID="Gen.37.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.9" sID="Gen.37.9"/>And he had another dream and told this to his father and his brothers and
said, Behold, I have dreamed another dream, as if the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.<verse eID="Gen.37.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.10" sID="Gen.37.10"/>Upon which his father rebuked him saying, What is this dream which thou hast dreamed? What! Shall I and thy mother and thy brothers come and bow down to thee on the ground?<verse eID="Gen.37.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.11" sID="Gen.37.11"/>So his brothers envied him; but his father pondered the matter.<verse eID="Gen.37.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.12" sID="Gen.37.12"/>After this his brothers having gone to Sychem to feed their father's flocks,<verse eID="Gen.37.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.13" sID="Gen.37.13"/>Israel said to Joseph, Are not thy brothers tending the flocks at Sychem? Come, let me send thee to them. And he said, I am ready.<verse eID="Gen.37.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.14" sID="Gen.37.14"/>Whereupon Israel said to him, Go and see if thy brothers and the flocks be well and bring me word. So he despatched him from the valley of Hebron and he went to Sychem:<verse eID="Gen.37.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.15" sID="Gen.37.15"/>and a man found him wandering in the plain. And the man asked him saying, What art thou seeking?<verse eID="Gen.37.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.16" sID="Gen.37.16"/>To which he replied, I am seeking my brothers, tell me where they are feeding.<verse eID="Gen.37.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.17" sID="Gen.37.17"/>And the man said to him, They have removed from this place; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothaim. So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothaim.<verse eID="Gen.37.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.18" sID="Gen.37.18"/>Now when they saw him at a great distance before he came near them, they wickedly thought of killing him<verse eID="Gen.37.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.19" sID="Gen.37.19"/>and said one to another, Behold the dreamer is coming.<verse eID="Gen.37.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.20" sID="Gen.37.20"/>Now therefore come let us kill him and throw him into one of these pits, and we will say a savage beast hath devoured him. And let us see what will become of his dreams.<verse eID="Gen.37.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.21" sID="Gen.37.21"/>But when Reuben heard he rescued him out of their hands and said, Let us not touch his life.<verse eID="Gen.37.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.22" sID="Gen.37.22"/>Reuben indeed said to them, Shed not blood. Throw him into one of these pits in the wilderness, but lay not a hand on him, in order that he might rescue him out of their hands and deliver him to his father.<verse eID="Gen.37.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.23" sID="Gen.37.23"/>So when Joseph came to his brothers they stripped him of the variegated robe which he had on<verse eID="Gen.37.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.24" sID="Gen.37.24"/>and took him and threw him into the pit. But the pit was empty. It had no water.<verse eID="Gen.37.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.25" sID="Gen.37.25"/>Then they sat down to eat bread. And raising their eyes they looked; and lo! Ismaelite travellers were coming out of Galaad and their camels were loaded with spiceries, with balm and stacte, which they were carrying to Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.37.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.26" sID="Gen.37.26"/>Thereupon Judas said to his brothers, What advantage will it be though we
slay our brother and conceal his blood?<verse eID="Gen.37.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.27" sID="Gen.37.27"/>Come let us sell him to these Ismaelites and let not our hands be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh. So his brothers hearkened to him.<verse eID="Gen.37.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.28" sID="Gen.37.28"/>And when the Madienite merchants came, they drew him up. They lifted Joseph up out of the pit and sold him to the Ismaelites for twenty pieces of gold; and they carried Joseph down to Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.37.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.29" sID="Gen.37.29"/>Now when Reuben came back to the pit and did not see Joseph in it, he rent his cloaths<verse eID="Gen.37.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.30" sID="Gen.37.30"/>and returned to his brothers and said, The boy is gone. And as for me where now am I to go?<verse eID="Gen.37.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.31" sID="Gen.37.31"/>Then they took Joseph's coat, and having killed a kid of the goats they besmeared the coat with the blood<verse eID="Gen.37.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.32" sID="Gen.37.32"/>and sent away the variegated robe and had it carried to his father and
said, This we found. Examine whether it be thy son's robe or not.<verse eID="Gen.37.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.33" sID="Gen.37.33"/>And he knew it and said, It is my son's robe. An evil beast hath devoured him. A wild beast hath torn Joseph.<verse eID="Gen.37.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.34" sID="Gen.37.34"/>Then Jacob rent his cloaths and put on sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.<verse eID="Gen.37.34"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.35" sID="Gen.37.35"/>And all his sons and daughters assembled and came to comfort him, but he would not be comforted saying, I will go to my son mourning, to the mansion of the dead. Thus his father mourned for him.<verse eID="Gen.37.35"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.37.36" sID="Gen.37.36"/>But the Madienites sold Joseph in Egypt to Petephres the chamberlain of Pharao, the captain of the guards.<verse eID="Gen.37.36"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.37"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.38" sID="Gen.38"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.1" sID="Gen.38.1"/>Now at that time Judas went down from his brothers and came to a certain Odollamite whose name was Eiras.<verse eID="Gen.38.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.2" sID="Gen.38.2"/>And Judas saw there a daughter of a Chananite, her name was Sava. And he took her and went in unto her<verse eID="Gen.38.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.3" sID="Gen.38.3"/>and she conceived and bore a son and called his name Er.<verse eID="Gen.38.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.4" sID="Gen.38.4"/>And she conceived again and bore a son and called his name Aunan.<verse eID="Gen.38.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.5" sID="Gen.38.5"/>And she bore another son and called his name Selom. Now she was at Chasbi when she bore them.<verse eID="Gen.38.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.6" sID="Gen.38.6"/>And for Er his first born Judas took a wife whose name was Thamar.<verse eID="Gen.38.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.7" sID="Gen.38.7"/>But Er the first born of Judas was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and God slew him.<verse eID="Gen.38.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.8" sID="Gen.38.8"/>Whereupon Judas said to Aunan, Go in unto thy brother's wife and be a husband to her and raise up a seed for thy brother.<verse eID="Gen.38.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.9" sID="Gen.38.9"/>But when Aunan knew that the seed would not be his, it came to pass that when he went in unto his brother's wife he shed it on the ground; that he might not give seed to his brother.<verse eID="Gen.38.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.10" sID="Gen.38.10"/>And it appeared evil in the sight of God that he had done this, therefore he caused him also to die.<verse eID="Gen.38.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.11" sID="Gen.38.11"/>Then Judas said to Thamar his daughter in law, Continue a widow in thy father's house till my son Selom grow up. For he said, Peradventure he also may die as his brothers did. So Thamar went and dwelt at her father's house.<verse eID="Gen.38.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.12" sID="Gen.38.12"/>But the time was prolonged and Sava the wife of Judas died. And when Judas was comforted he went up to his sheep shearers, he and his shepherd Eiras the Odollamite, to Thamna.<verse eID="Gen.38.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.13" sID="Gen.38.13"/>And it was told Thamar his daughter in law saying, Lo! thy father in law is going up to Thamna to shear his sheep.<verse eID="Gen.38.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.14" sID="Gen.38.14"/>Whereupon she put off the robes of her widowhood and put on a veil and adorned herself and sat near the gates of Ainan in the way to Thamna. For she
saw that Selom was grown up and that he had not given her to him for a wife.<verse eID="Gen.38.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.15" sID="Gen.38.15"/>And when Judas saw her, he thought she was a harlot, for she had covered her face<verse eID="Gen.38.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.16" sID="Gen.38.16"/>and he did not know her. So he turned aside to her and said to her, Let me come in unto thee. For he did not know that she was his daughter in law. And
she said, What wilt thou give me if thou come in unto me?<verse eID="Gen.38.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.17" sID="Gen.38.17"/>To which he replied, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?<verse eID="Gen.38.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.18" sID="Gen.38.18"/>And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy ring and bracelet and the staff in thy hand. So he gave them to her, and went in unto her, and she conceived by him.<verse eID="Gen.38.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.19" sID="Gen.38.19"/>Then she arose and went away, and took off her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.<verse eID="Gen.38.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.20" sID="Gen.38.20"/>And Judas sent the kid of the goats by the hands of his shepherd the Odollamite to receive from the woman the pledge.<verse eID="Gen.38.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.21" sID="Gen.38.21"/>But he not finding her asked the men of the place, Where is the harlot that was at Ainan by the way side? And they said, There was not a harlot there.<verse eID="Gen.38.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.22" sID="Gen.38.22"/>Thereupon he returned to Judas and said, I have not found her. And the men of the place said there was not a harlot there.<verse eID="Gen.38.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.23" sID="Gen.38.23"/>Then Judas said, Let her keep them. But perhaps we may be laughed at. I indeed sent the kid. Thou however hast not found her.<verse eID="Gen.38.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.24" sID="Gen.38.24"/>Now after three months it was told Judas saying, Thamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot, and lo! she is with child by her whoredom. Whereupon Judas said, Bring her out and let her be burned.<verse eID="Gen.38.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.25" sID="Gen.38.25"/>And when she was brought out she sent to her father in law saying, By the man to whom these belong I am with child. Moreover she said, Examine, whose is this ring and this bracelet and this staff?<verse eID="Gen.38.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.26" sID="Gen.38.26"/>And Judas acknowledged them and said, Thamar hath more justice on her
side than I, because I did not give her to my son Selom. And he proceeded no more to have knowledge of her.<verse eID="Gen.38.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.27" sID="Gen.38.27"/>And when the time of her delivery came she had twins.<verse eID="Gen.38.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.28" sID="Gen.38.28"/>And when she was in child birth, one put forth its hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread about its hand, saying, This will be the first born.<verse eID="Gen.38.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.29" sID="Gen.38.29"/>But when it had drawn back its hand, his brother immediately came forth. Whereupon she said, What! Hath there been a breach made for thee? So she called his name Phares.<verse eID="Gen.38.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.38.30" sID="Gen.38.30"/>And after this his brother came forth, on whose hand was the scarlet thread. So she called his name Zara.<verse eID="Gen.38.30"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.38"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.39" sID="Gen.39"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.1" sID="Gen.39.1"/>Now when Joseph was brought to Egypt, Petephres the chamberlain of Pharao, the captain of the guards, an Egyptian, bought him at the hands of the Ismaelites, who had brought him thither.<verse eID="Gen.39.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.2" sID="Gen.39.2"/>And the Lord was with Joseph, so that he was a fortunate man and was in the same house with his master the Egyptian.<verse eID="Gen.39.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.3" sID="Gen.39.3"/>And his master perceived that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord prospered in his hands what ever he did.<verse eID="Gen.39.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.4" sID="Gen.39.4"/>So Joseph found favour in the sight of his master; and he was pleased with him and set him over his household and committed all that he had to Joseph's charge.<verse eID="Gen.39.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.5" sID="Gen.39.5"/>And after he had made him overseer of his household, and over all that he had, the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake; and there was a blessing of the Lord on all his substance, in his house and in his field.<verse eID="Gen.39.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.6" sID="Gen.39.6"/>So he left to Joseph's management all that he had, and knew not any thing he had save the bread which he ate.</p>
<p>
Now Joseph was a comely person and of a very beautiful countenance,<verse eID="Gen.39.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.7" sID="Gen.39.7"/>and after these things his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, Lie with me;<verse eID="Gen.39.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.8" sID="Gen.39.8"/>but he refused and said to his master's wife, Seeing my lord, on account of his confidence in me, knoweth not any thing in his house, and hath committed to my charge all that he hath<verse eID="Gen.39.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.9" sID="Gen.39.9"/>and there is none in the family superior to me, nor any thing withheld from me, except thyself because thou art his wife; how then can I do this wicked act and commit sin in the presence of God.<verse eID="Gen.39.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.10" sID="Gen.39.10"/>And when she had spoken to Joseph day after day and he hearkened not to her to lie down with her to have commerce with her,<verse eID="Gen.39.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.11" sID="Gen.39.11"/>it came to pass that one day when Joseph went into the house to transact his business and none of the domestics were within,<verse eID="Gen.39.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.12" sID="Gen.39.12"/>she took hold of his mantle saying, Lie with me. But he leaving his mantle in her hands fled and went out.<verse eID="Gen.39.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.13" sID="Gen.39.13"/>And when she saw that he had left his mantle in her hands and had fled and was gone,<verse eID="Gen.39.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.14" sID="Gen.39.14"/>she called those who were in the house and spoke to them saying, See! He hath brought in amongst us a Hebrew slave to insult us. He came to me saying, Lie with me. But I cried with a loud voice.<verse eID="Gen.39.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.15" sID="Gen.39.15"/>And when he heard that I raised my voice and cried aloud he left his mantle with me, fled and went out.<verse eID="Gen.39.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.16" sID="Gen.39.16"/>And she kept the garment by her till his master came home<verse eID="Gen.39.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.17" sID="Gen.39.17"/>and spoke to him in like terms saying, The Hebrew slave whom thou hast brought in amongst us came in to me to insult me and said to me, Let me lie with thee.<verse eID="Gen.39.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.18" sID="Gen.39.18"/>But when he heard that I raised my voice and cried aloud; leaving his mantle with me he fled and went out.<verse eID="Gen.39.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.19" sID="Gen.39.19"/>When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke saying, In this manner did thy slave treat me, he was greatly incensed.<verse eID="Gen.39.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.20" sID="Gen.39.20"/>So Joseph's master took and cast him into prison—into the place where the king's prisoners were confined.<verse eID="Gen.39.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.21" sID="Gen.39.21"/>But in the prison the Lord was with Joseph, and continued his kindness and gave him favour in the sight of the principal keeper of the prison.<verse eID="Gen.39.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.22" sID="Gen.39.22"/>And the principal keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's care the prison and all the prisoners who were in the prison. And whatever was done there, he was the person who caused it to be done.<verse eID="Gen.39.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.39.23" sID="Gen.39.23"/>The principal keeper took no cognizance of any thing himself; for all things were committed to Joseph's management, because the Lord was with him, and the Lord prospered in his hands whatever he did.<verse eID="Gen.39.23"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.39"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.40" sID="Gen.40"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.1" sID="Gen.40.1"/>Now after these things it happened that the chief butler of the king of Egypt and the chief baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.40.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.2" sID="Gen.40.2"/>And Pharao was incensed against his two officers, against the chief butler and against the chief baker<verse eID="Gen.40.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.3" sID="Gen.40.3"/>and sent them under a guard to prison—to the place to which Joseph had been sent.<verse eID="Gen.40.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.4" sID="Gen.40.4"/>And the keeper of the prison committed them to Joseph and he attended them. And when they had been there some days in prison,<verse eID="Gen.40.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.5" sID="Gen.40.5"/>they both had a dream, in the same night. And the appearance of the dream both of the chief butler and the chief baker, who belonged to the king of Egypt and were in prison, was similar.<verse eID="Gen.40.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.6" sID="Gen.40.6"/>And in the morning when Joseph went in to them he saw that they were troubled.<verse eID="Gen.40.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.7" sID="Gen.40.7"/>Whereupon he asked the officers of Pharao who were confined with him at his master's, saying, Why are your countenances sad to day?<verse eID="Gen.40.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.8" sID="Gen.40.8"/>And they said to him, We have had a dream and there is none to interpret it. And Joseph said, Is not the interpretation thereof from God? Therefore tell me.<verse eID="Gen.40.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.9" sID="Gen.40.9"/>So the chief butler told Joseph his dream and said, In my sleep there was a vine before me,<verse eID="Gen.40.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.10" sID="Gen.40.10"/>and on the vine three branches and one was flourishing and had produced clusters, and the grapes of one cluster were ripe.<verse eID="Gen.40.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.11" sID="Gen.40.11"/>And I had in my hand the cup of Pharao. So I took the bunch and squeezed it into the cup and gave the cup into Pharao's hand.<verse eID="Gen.40.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.12" sID="Gen.40.12"/>Thereupon Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it. The three branches are three days.<verse eID="Gen.40.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.13" sID="Gen.40.13"/>Three days hence Pharao will take cognizance of thy administration and restore thee to thy office of cup bearer, and thou shalt give Pharao's cup into his hand according to thy former dignity, when thou wast butler.<verse eID="Gen.40.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.14" sID="Gen.40.14"/>But think of me by thy own case, when it shall be well with thee; and do me the favour to mention me to Pharao and release me from this prison.<verse eID="Gen.40.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.15" sID="Gen.40.15"/>For I have been stolen from the land of the Hebrews; and here I have done nothing, yet they have thrown me into this dungeon.<verse eID="Gen.40.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.16" sID="Gen.40.16"/>And when the chief baker saw that he interpreted well he said to Joseph, I also had a dream, I thought I was carrying on my head three baskets of cakes,<verse eID="Gen.40.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.17" sID="Gen.40.17"/>and in the uppermost basket, pastry of all the sorts which Pharao eateth. And the birds of the air devoured those in the uppermost basket on my head.<verse eID="Gen.40.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.18" sID="Gen.40.18"/>And Joseph answered and said to him, This is the interpretation thereof. The three baskets are three days.<verse eID="Gen.40.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.19" sID="Gen.40.19"/>Three days hence Pharao will take off thy head and hang thee on a gibbet and the birds of the air will devour thy flesh.<verse eID="Gen.40.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.20" sID="Gen.40.20"/>Accordingly it fell out, that the third day was Pharao's birth day, and he made an entertainment for all his servants and took cognizance of the administration of the butler, and the administration of the baker in the midst of his servants.<verse eID="Gen.40.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.21" sID="Gen.40.21"/>And he restored the butler to his office, and he gave the cup into Pharao's hand.<verse eID="Gen.40.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.22" sID="Gen.40.22"/>But the chief baker he hanged as Joseph had interpreted to them.<verse eID="Gen.40.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.40.23" sID="Gen.40.23"/>Yet the chief butler made no mention of Joseph, but passed him over in oblivion.<verse eID="Gen.40.23"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.40"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.41" sID="Gen.41"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.1" sID="Gen.41.1"/>But it happened that at the end of two years Pharao had a dream. He thought he was standing by the river;<verse eID="Gen.41.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.2" sID="Gen.41.2"/>and lo! there came up out of the river seven cows of a beautiful figure and very fat; and they fed on the sedge.<verse eID="Gen.41.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.3" sID="Gen.41.3"/>And seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and lean; and they fed near the other cows on the bank of the river;<verse eID="Gen.41.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.4" sID="Gen.41.4"/>and the seven ill favoured and lean cows devoured the seven cows which were of a beautiful figure and full of flesh. And Pharao awoke.<verse eID="Gen.41.4"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.5" sID="Gen.41.5"/>Again he dreamed a second time; and lo! seven ears of corn sprang upon one
stalk, choice and good:<verse eID="Gen.41.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.6" sID="Gen.41.6"/>and lo! seven ears thin and blasted sprang up after them.<verse eID="Gen.41.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.7" sID="Gen.41.7"/>And the seven thin and blasted ears devoured the seven ears which were choice and full. And Pharao awoke; and it was a dream.<verse eID="Gen.41.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.8" sID="Gen.41.8"/>And in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent for all the interpreters of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof, and told them his dream, but there was none who could interpret it to Pharao.<verse eID="Gen.41.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.9" sID="Gen.41.9"/>Upon this the chief butler spoke to Pharao, saying, I this day acknowledge my fault.<verse eID="Gen.41.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.10" sID="Gen.41.10"/>Pharao was angry with his servants, and ordered us to be confined in the house of the captain of the guards—both me and the chief baker.<verse eID="Gen.41.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.11" sID="Gen.41.11"/>And both I and he had a dream the same night, each had a dream regarding himself.<verse eID="Gen.41.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.12" sID="Gen.41.12"/>And there was there with us a youth, a Hebrew servant of the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us.<verse eID="Gen.41.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.13" sID="Gen.41.13"/>And it fell out as he interpreted to us—I was restored to my office; but he was hanged.<verse eID="Gen.41.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.14" sID="Gen.41.14"/>Upon this Pharao sent for Joseph, and they brought him out of the prison. And when they had shaved him and changed his raiment, he came to Pharao.<verse eID="Gen.41.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.15" sID="Gen.41.15"/>And Pharao said to Joseph, I have had a dream and there is none who can interpret it. But I have heard people say of thee, that upon hearing dreams thou canst interpret them.<verse eID="Gen.41.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.16" sID="Gen.41.16"/>In reply to which, Joseph said to Pharao, Without God no answer of peace can be given to Pharao.<verse eID="Gen.41.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.17" sID="Gen.41.17"/>Then Pharao spoke to Joseph saying, In my sleep I thought I was standing near the edge of the river;<verse eID="Gen.41.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.18" sID="Gen.41.18"/>and there came up as it were out of the river, seven cows of a beautiful figure, and very fat; and they fed on the sedge.<verse eID="Gen.41.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.19" sID="Gen.41.19"/>And lo! seven other cows came up after them, out of the river, ugly and ill favoured and lean of flesh; such that I never saw worse in all the land of Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.41.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.20" sID="Gen.41.20"/>And the seven ill favoured and lean cows devoured the first seven cows which were choice and good.<verse eID="Gen.41.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.21" sID="Gen.41.21"/>But though they devoured them, they gave no sign of fulnes. Their appearance was as ugly as before.</p>
<p>
Then I awoke and again went to sleep,<verse eID="Gen.41.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.22" sID="Gen.41.22"/>and in my sleep I again saw as if seven ears of corn sprang up, on one
stalk, full and good;<verse eID="Gen.41.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.23" sID="Gen.41.23"/>and adjoining them seven other ears sprang up, thin and blasted.<verse eID="Gen.41.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.24" sID="Gen.41.24"/>And the seven thin and blasted ears devoured the seven ears which were full and good. Now I have told the interpreters; but there is not one who can interpret this to me.<verse eID="Gen.41.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.25" sID="Gen.41.25"/>Then Joseph said to Pharao, The dream of Pharao is one. God hath shewn Pharao what he is about to do.<verse eID="Gen.41.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.26" sID="Gen.41.26"/>The seven beautiful cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are
seven years. The dream of Pharao is one.<verse eID="Gen.41.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.27" sID="Gen.41.27"/>The seven lean cows also which came up after them are seven years; and the seven thin and blasted ears are seven years. There shall be seven years of famine.<verse eID="Gen.41.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.28" sID="Gen.41.28"/>This is the thing which I have said to Pharao, God hath shewn Pharao what he is about to do.<verse eID="Gen.41.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.29" sID="Gen.41.29"/>Behold seven years are coming of great plenty in all the land of Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.41.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.30" sID="Gen.41.30"/>But after these there will come seven years of famine. And they will cause the coming plenty to be forgotten in all Egypt. And the famine will consume the land,<verse eID="Gen.41.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.31" sID="Gen.41.31"/>so that the plenty will not be known in the land, by reason of the famine which will come after it: for it will be very great.<verse eID="Gen.41.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.32" sID="Gen.41.32"/>And in as much as the dream of Pharao was doubled, the thing which God had determined will surely come to pass; and God is hasting to do it.<verse eID="Gen.41.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.33" sID="Gen.41.33"/>Now therefore look out for a man of prudence and understanding, and set him over the land of Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.41.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.34" sID="Gen.41.34"/>And let Pharao appoint and set governors of districts over the whole land, and let them send in a fifth of all the products of the land of Egypt, during the seven years of plenty,<verse eID="Gen.41.34"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.35" sID="Gen.41.35"/>and collect all the eatables of those seven good years which are coming. And let food be collected under the care of Pharao, and eatables stored in the cities.<verse eID="Gen.41.35"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.36" sID="Gen.41.36"/>So shall food be kept in the country, against the seven years of famine which will be in the land of Egypt, and the country will not be wasted with the famine.<verse eID="Gen.41.36"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.37" sID="Gen.41.37"/>And the advice was agreeable in the view of Pharao and in the view of all his servants.<verse eID="Gen.41.37"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.38" sID="Gen.41.38"/>And Pharao said to all his servants, Can we find such a man as this who hath in him the spirit of God?<verse eID="Gen.41.38"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.39" sID="Gen.41.39"/>Then Pharao said to Joseph, Seeing God hath shewn thee all these things, there is none more prudent and wise than thou thyself.<verse eID="Gen.41.39"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.40" sID="Gen.41.40"/>Thou shalt be over my household and to thy command all my people shall pay obedience. Only on the throne will I be greater than thou.<verse eID="Gen.41.40"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.41" sID="Gen.41.41"/>Moreover Pharao said to Joseph, Behold I have set thee this day over all the land of Egypt,<verse eID="Gen.41.41"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.42" sID="Gen.41.42"/>And Pharao took off the ring from his own hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him with a cotton robe, and put a chain of gold about his neck;<verse eID="Gen.41.42"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.43" sID="Gen.41.43"/>and caused him to mount a chariot next to that of his own. And a herald made proclamation before him. And when he had set him over all the land of Egypt,<verse eID="Gen.41.43"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.44" sID="Gen.41.44"/>Pharao said to Joseph, I am Pharao. Without thee no man shall lift up his hand in all the land of Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.41.44"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.45" sID="Gen.41.45"/>And Pharao called Joseph's name Psonthomphanech and gave him Aseneth a daughter of Petephres the priest of Heliopolis to be his wife.<verse eID="Gen.41.45"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.46" sID="Gen.41.46"/>Now Joseph was thirty years old, when he stood before Pharao king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharao and went through all the land of Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.41.46"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.47" sID="Gen.41.47"/>And in the seven years of plenty the land produced in vast abundance<verse eID="Gen.41.47"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.48" sID="Gen.41.48"/>and he collected all the varieties of food of those seven years, in which there was plenty in the land of Egypt and stored it in the cities. In every city he stored the eatable productions of the fields around.<verse eID="Gen.41.48"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.49" sID="Gen.41.49"/>So Joseph collected food like the sand of the sea in great abundance until it could not be numbered, for it was innumerable.<verse eID="Gen.41.49"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.50" sID="Gen.41.50"/>Now before the seven years of famine Joseph had two sons, whom Aseneth the daughter of Petephres the priest of Heliopolis bore to him.<verse eID="Gen.41.50"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.51" sID="Gen.41.51"/>And Joseph called the name of his first born Manasses, because God hath made me forget all my troubles and all my father's family.<verse eID="Gen.41.51"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.52" sID="Gen.41.52"/>And the name of his second son he called Ephraim, because God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.<verse eID="Gen.41.52"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.53" sID="Gen.41.53"/>And when the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Egypt were past,<verse eID="Gen.41.53"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.54" sID="Gen.41.54"/>the seven years of famine began to come as Joseph said. And there was a famine in the whole earth, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.<verse eID="Gen.41.54"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.55" sID="Gen.41.55"/>And when all the land of Egypt began to be in want and the people cried to Pharao for bread, Pharao said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph and do whatever he saith to you.<verse eID="Gen.41.55"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.56" sID="Gen.41.56"/>As the famine was over the face of the whole earth, when Joseph opened all his granaries and sold to all the Egyptians,<verse eID="Gen.41.56"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.41.57" sID="Gen.41.57"/>all the countries came to Egypt to buy of Joseph, for the famine was great in the whole earth.<verse eID="Gen.41.57"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.41"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.42.1" sID="Gen.42.1"/>And when Jacob found that there was a sale in Egypt he said to his sons, Why sit ye still?<verse eID="Gen.42.1"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.42.3" sID="Gen.42.3"/>So Joseph's ten brothers went down to purchase corn from Egypt:<verse eID="Gen.42.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.4" sID="Gen.42.4"/>but Benjamin the brother of Joseph he did not send with his brothers; for he said, Perhaps some misfortune may happen to him.</p>

<verse osisID="Gen.42.5" sID="Gen.42.5"/>Now when the sons of Israel went to buy in company with others who were going, for the famine was in the land of Chanaan,<verse eID="Gen.42.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.6" sID="Gen.42.6"/>Joseph was the governor of the country; he sold to all the people of that land. So when Joseph's brothers came they made obeisance to him with their face to the ground.<verse eID="Gen.42.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.7" sID="Gen.42.7"/>And when Joseph saw his brothers he knew them and was reserved and spoke harshly to them and said to them, Whence come you? And they said, From the land of Chanaan to buy food.<verse eID="Gen.42.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.8" sID="Gen.42.8"/>Now Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him.<verse eID="Gen.42.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.9" sID="Gen.42.9"/>And Joseph remembered the dreams, which he had dreamed and said to them, You are spies. You are come to examine the ways into this country.<verse eID="Gen.42.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.10" sID="Gen.42.10"/>And they said, No, my lord. We thy servants are come to buy food.<verse eID="Gen.42.10"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.42.13" sID="Gen.42.13"/>Then they said, Thy servants were twelve brothers in the land of Chanaan. And lo! the youngest is now with our father; but the other is no more.<verse eID="Gen.42.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.14" sID="Gen.42.14"/>Upon this Joseph said, It is as I said, you are spies.<verse eID="Gen.42.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.15" sID="Gen.42.15"/>By this you shall be proved. By the health of Pharao you shall not depart hence unless your youngest brother come hither.<verse eID="Gen.42.15"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.42.20" sID="Gen.42.20"/>and bring your younger brother to me, so shall your words be believed. Unless you do this you shall die. On this occasion they acted thus—<verse eID="Gen.42.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.21" sID="Gen.42.21"/>they said one to another, We indeed are to blame in respect to our brother. Because we disregarded the anguish of his soul, when he intreated us and we would not hear him; for this cause therefore this affliction is come upon us.<verse eID="Gen.42.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.22" sID="Gen.42.22"/>And Reuben in reply said to them, Did I not speak to you saying, Do the lad no injury, but you hearkened not to me. Now behold inquisition is made for his blood.<verse eID="Gen.42.22"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.42.24" sID="Gen.42.24"/>On this Joseph withdrew from them and wept. Then he came to them again and spoke to them and he took Symeon from among them and bound him before their eyes.<verse eID="Gen.42.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.25" sID="Gen.42.25"/>Then Joseph gave orders to fill their sacks with corn and to put every one's money in his bag and to furnish them with provisions for the journey. So this being done for them<verse eID="Gen.42.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.26" sID="Gen.42.26"/>they loaded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.<verse eID="Gen.42.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.27" sID="Gen.42.27"/>And one of them having loosed his bag to give his asses provender at a place where they lodged saw his roll of money, for it was in the mouth of his bag,<verse eID="Gen.42.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.28" sID="Gen.42.28"/>and said to his brothers, The money is returned to me. See, here it is in my bag. Whereupon their heart fainted and they were alarmed and said one to another, What is this which God hath done to us?<verse eID="Gen.42.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.29" sID="Gen.42.29"/>And when they came to their father Jacob to the land of Chanaan, they told him all that had happened to them and said,<verse eID="Gen.42.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.30" sID="Gen.42.30"/>The man the lord of the country spoke harshly to us and put us in prison as coming to spy the country;<verse eID="Gen.42.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.31" sID="Gen.42.31"/>and we told him, We are men of peace, We are not spies.<verse eID="Gen.42.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.32" sID="Gen.42.32"/>We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more. And the youngest is now with our father in the land of Chanaan.<verse eID="Gen.42.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.33" sID="Gen.42.33"/>Upon which the man the lord of the country said to us, By this I shall know that you are men of peace. Leave here with me one brother; and taking the corn purchased for your family go<verse eID="Gen.42.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.34" sID="Gen.42.34"/>and bring me your younger brother, then I shall know that you are not
spies; but men of peace. And I will restore to you your brother and you may traffick in the land.<verse eID="Gen.42.34"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.35" sID="Gen.42.35"/>And when they emptied their sacks every one's roll of money was in their
several sacks. And when they and their father saw their rolls of money they were terrified.<verse eID="Gen.42.35"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.36" sID="Gen.42.36"/>And Jacob their father said to them, Me you have bereaved of children. Joseph is gone. Symeon is gone. And will you take away Benjamin? All these things are against me.<verse eID="Gen.42.36"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.37" sID="Gen.42.37"/>Then Reuben spoke to their father saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not back to thee. Commit him to my charge and I will bring him back to thee.<verse eID="Gen.42.37"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.42.38" sID="Gen.42.38"/>But he said, My son shall not go down with you. For his brother is dead and he alone is left. If any mischief should happen to him in the way you are going, you will bring down my old age with sorrow to the mansion of the dead.<verse eID="Gen.42.38"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.42"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.43" sID="Gen.43"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.1" sID="Gen.43.1"/>Still the famine prevailed in the land.<verse eID="Gen.43.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.2" sID="Gen.43.2"/>So when they had eaten up the corn which they brought from Egypt their father said to them, Go again and buy for us a little food.<verse eID="Gen.43.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.3" sID="Gen.43.3"/>Whereupon Judas spoke to him and said, The man who is the lord of the country solemnly protested saying, You shall not see my face, unless your youngest brother be with you.<verse eID="Gen.43.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.4" sID="Gen.43.4"/>If therefore thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee food.<verse eID="Gen.43.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.5" sID="Gen.43.5"/>But if thou wilt not send our brother with us we will not go. For the man
spoke to us saying, You shall not see my face unless your youngest brother be with you.<verse eID="Gen.43.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.6" sID="Gen.43.6"/>And Israel said, Why did you do me this ill in telling the man that you had a brother?<verse eID="Gen.43.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.7" sID="Gen.43.7"/>And they said, The man examined us strictly touching our family and said, Is your father alive? And have you a brother? And we answered him according to this examination. Could we know that he would say, Bring your brother?<verse eID="Gen.43.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.8" sID="Gen.43.8"/>Moreover Judas said to his father Israel, Send thy son with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die, both we and thou and all that we have.<verse eID="Gen.43.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.9" sID="Gen.43.9"/>I undertake the charge of him. At my hand require him. If I bring him not back to thee and set him before thee let me be a sinner against thee for ever.<verse eID="Gen.43.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.10" sID="Gen.43.10"/>For if we had not been delayed we might have now been back a second time.<verse eID="Gen.43.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.11" sID="Gen.43.11"/>Then Israel their father said to them, If it must be so, do this, Take of all the fruits of this land in your vessels and carry down for the man presents of balm and honey and incense both stacte and terebinthus and almonds.<verse eID="Gen.43.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.12" sID="Gen.43.12"/>Take also double money in your hands and carry back the money which was returned in your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake.<verse eID="Gen.43.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.13" sID="Gen.43.13"/>And take your brother and arise and go down to the man.<verse eID="Gen.43.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.14" sID="Gen.43.14"/>And may my God grant you favour in the sight of the man that he may send back your brother with Benjamin. As for me I am bereaved of children as I have been bereaved.<verse eID="Gen.43.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.15" sID="Gen.43.15"/>So the men took the presents and the double money in their hands and Benjamin and arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.<verse eID="Gen.43.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.16" sID="Gen.43.16"/>And when Joseph saw them and Benjamin his brother by the same mother he
said to his steward, conduct these men into the house and kill victims and make ready, for these men are to dine with me at noon.<verse eID="Gen.43.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.17" sID="Gen.43.17"/>So the man did as Joseph ordered and conducted them to Joseph's house.<verse eID="Gen.43.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.18" sID="Gen.43.18"/>And when the men saw that they were conducted to Joseph's house, they
said, On account of the money which was returned in our bags in the former journey we are brought in for the purpose of accusing us and charging us with it, that he may make us slaves and take our asses.<verse eID="Gen.43.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.19" sID="Gen.43.19"/>Therefore they went near to the man the steward of Joseph's house and
spoke to him at the gate of the house saying,<verse eID="Gen.43.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.20" sID="Gen.43.20"/>Sir, we came down for the first time to purchase provisions,<verse eID="Gen.43.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.21" sID="Gen.43.21"/>But when we came to the lodging place and opened our bags every man's money was in his bag. This money we have now brought back in our hands in full weight.<verse eID="Gen.43.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.22" sID="Gen.43.22"/>And we have brought with us other money to buy provisions—Who put the money into our bags we do not know.<verse eID="Gen.43.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.23" sID="Gen.43.23"/>Upon which he said to them, Peace be to you: fear not, your God and the God of your fathers hath given you treasures in your bags. But as for your money, with perfect good will I decline receiving it. Then he brought out Symeon to them<verse eID="Gen.43.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.24" sID="Gen.43.24"/>and brought them water to wash their feet and gave provender to their asses.<verse eID="Gen.43.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.25" sID="Gen.43.25"/>And they were employed in making ready the presents until Joseph came at noon, for they heard that he was to dine there.<verse eID="Gen.43.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.26" sID="Gen.43.26"/>So when Joseph came home they brought him the presents which they had in their hands into the house and made obeisance to him with their face on the ground.<verse eID="Gen.43.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.27" sID="Gen.43.27"/>And he asked them of their welfare and said to them, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still living?<verse eID="Gen.43.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.28" sID="Gen.43.28"/>And they said, Thy servant, our father is well. He is still alive. And he
said, Blessed of God is that man. Whereupon they bowed down and made obeisance to him.<verse eID="Gen.43.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.29" sID="Gen.43.29"/>And when Joseph raised his eyes and saw Benjamin his brother by the same mother, he said, This is your youngest brother whom you promised to bring to me? Then he said, God be gracious to thee, my son.<verse eID="Gen.43.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.30" sID="Gen.43.30"/>And Joseph was discomposed, for his bowels yearned towards his brother;
so he sought where to weep and went into his chamber and wept there.<verse eID="Gen.43.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.31" sID="Gen.43.31"/>And when he had washed his face and come out he restrained himself and
said, Serve up dinner.<verse eID="Gen.43.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.32" sID="Gen.43.32"/>So they served up for him by himself and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who dined with him, by themselves. For the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews. For that to the Egyptians is an abomination.<verse eID="Gen.43.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.33" sID="Gen.43.33"/>And they sat before him, the first born according to his birth right and the youngest according to his youth. And the men were astonished, one at another.<verse eID="Gen.43.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.43.34" sID="Gen.43.34"/>And when they received their several messes from him, the mess of Benjamin was five times larger than any of theirs. And when they had drank and been plentifully regaled with him<verse eID="Gen.43.34"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.43"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.44" sID="Gen.44"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.1" sID="Gen.44.1"/>Joseph gave orders to the steward of his house saying, Fill the bags of these men with corn, as much as they can carry, and put every one's money in the mouth of his bag,<verse eID="Gen.44.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.2" sID="Gen.44.2"/>and put my silver cup in the bag of the youngest along with the price of his corn. And Joseph's orders being punctually executed;<verse eID="Gen.44.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.3" sID="Gen.44.3"/>the next morning as soon as it was light the men were sent away they and their asses.<verse eID="Gen.44.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.4" sID="Gen.44.4"/>And when they were gone out of the city, but had not got far off, Joseph
said to his steward, Arise and pursue those men; and when thou shalt overtake them, say to them, Why have you returned evil for good?<verse eID="Gen.44.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.5" sID="Gen.44.5"/>Why have you stolen my silver cup? Is not this it out of which my lord drinketh. By it indeed he divineth. You have done evil in so doing.<verse eID="Gen.44.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.6" sID="Gen.44.6"/>So when he overtook them he spoke to them in these terms.<verse eID="Gen.44.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.7" sID="Gen.44.7"/>Upon which they said to him, Why doth my lord speak in such terms as these: Far be it from thy servants to do such an act.<verse eID="Gen.44.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.8" sID="Gen.44.8"/>If we indeed brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan the money which we found in our bags, how should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?<verse eID="Gen.44.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.9" sID="Gen.44.9"/>With whomsoever of thy servants thou shalt find the cup, let him die, and we will be our lord's slaves.<verse eID="Gen.44.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.10" sID="Gen.44.10"/>And he said, Well; Let it be as you say thus far—With whomsoever the cup be found, he shall be my slave; but you shall be blameless.<verse eID="Gen.44.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.11" sID="Gen.44.11"/>Then they hasted, and set down, every one his bag on the ground, and opened, every one his bag.<verse eID="Gen.44.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.12" sID="Gen.44.12"/>And he searched beginning at the eldest till he came to the youngest; and he found the cup in Benjamin's bag.<verse eID="Gen.44.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.13" sID="Gen.44.13"/>Whereupon they rent their cloaths and put every one his bag on his ass and returned to the city.<verse eID="Gen.44.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.14" sID="Gen.44.14"/>And Judas with his brothers went in to Joseph who was still there; and they fell on the ground before him.<verse eID="Gen.44.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.15" sID="Gen.44.15"/>And Joseph said to them, What is this you have done? Did you not know that such a man as I can divine?<verse eID="Gen.44.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.16" sID="Gen.44.16"/>And Judas said, What answer can we make to my lord? Or what can we say? Or how can we justify ourselves? God hath indeed found out the iniquity of thy
servants. Behold we are slaves to our lord—both we and he with whom the cup was found.<verse eID="Gen.44.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.17" sID="Gen.44.17"/>And Joseph said, Far be it from me to do such a thing. The man with whom the cup was found shall be my servant; but as for you go up in peace to your father.<verse eID="Gen.44.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.18" sID="Gen.44.18"/>Upon this Judas came near to him and said, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy presence and be not angry with thy servant, for thou art next to Pharao.<verse eID="Gen.44.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.19" sID="Gen.44.19"/>Thou my lord didst ask thy servants saying, Have you a father or a brother?<verse eID="Gen.44.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.20" sID="Gen.44.20"/>And we said to my lord, We have a father an old man; and he hath a younger son of his old age. His brother is dead, and as he is the only one of his mother left; his father loveth him.<verse eID="Gen.44.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.21" sID="Gen.44.21"/>Then thou saidst to thy servants, Bring him down to me and I will take care of him.<verse eID="Gen.44.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.22" sID="Gen.44.22"/>And we said to my lord, This son cannot leave his father; for if he were to leave him, his father would die.<verse eID="Gen.44.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.23" sID="Gen.44.23"/>Then thou saidst to thy servants, Unless your younger brother come down with you, you shall no more be admitted to see my face.<verse eID="Gen.44.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.24" sID="Gen.44.24"/>So when we went up to thy servant our father, we told him the words of our lord.<verse eID="Gen.44.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.25" sID="Gen.44.25"/>And when our father said, Go again and buy for us a little food;<verse eID="Gen.44.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.26" sID="Gen.44.26"/>we said, We cannot go. If indeed our youngest brother will go down with us, we will go down. For we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother be with us.<verse eID="Gen.44.26"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.27" sID="Gen.44.27"/>Thereupon thy servant our father said to us, You know that my wife bore me two sons;<verse eID="Gen.44.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.28" sID="Gen.44.28"/>and that one went out from me and you said he was devoured by a wild beast and I have not seen him since.<verse eID="Gen.44.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.29" sID="Gen.44.29"/>If therefore you take this one also from me and any misfortune happen to him on the journey, you will bring down my old age with sorrow to the grave.<verse eID="Gen.44.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.30" sID="Gen.44.30"/>Now therefore if I should go to thy servant our father and this son be not with us, as his life dependeth on the life of this son,<verse eID="Gen.44.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.31" sID="Gen.44.31"/>it will come to pass that when he shall see that this son is not with us he will die. Thus will thy servants bring down the old age of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.<verse eID="Gen.44.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.32" sID="Gen.44.32"/>Besides as thy servant received this son from his father and said, If I bring him not back to thee and set him before thee, let me be as a sinner against my father for ever;<verse eID="Gen.44.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.33" sID="Gen.44.33"/>now therefore let me stay with thee instead of him as a slave to my lord, and let this son go up with his brothers<verse eID="Gen.44.33"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.44.34" sID="Gen.44.34"/>(for how can I go up to my father and this son not with us?) that I may not see the evils which will befal my father.<verse eID="Gen.44.34"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.44"/>

<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.1" sID="Gen.45.1"/>Upon this Joseph could not restrain himself before all his attendants, but
said, Dismiss all from me. So there was no attendant with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers,<verse eID="Gen.45.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.2" sID="Gen.45.2"/>but in weeping he raised his voice so that all the Egyptians heard and the news was carried to Pharao's house,<verse eID="Gen.45.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.3" sID="Gen.45.3"/>And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph. Is my father still alive? But his brothers could not answer him; for they were confounded.<verse eID="Gen.45.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.4" sID="Gen.45.4"/>Then Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me? And when they came near; he said, I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.45.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.5" sID="Gen.45.5"/>Now therefore be not grieved, nor let it afflict you that you sold me hither; for God sent me before you for life.<verse eID="Gen.45.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.6" sID="Gen.45.6"/>For this is but the second year of famine on the earth and there will be yet five years, in which there will be neither tillage nor harvest,<verse eID="Gen.45.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.7" sID="Gen.45.7"/>so that God hath sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on the earth and to nourish your great remnant.<verse eID="Gen.45.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.8" sID="Gen.45.8"/>Now therefore it was not you who sent me hither, but it was God. And he hath made me like a father to Pharao, and lord of all his house and governor of all the land of Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.45.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.9" sID="Gen.45.9"/>Haste therefore and go up to my father and say to him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me ruler of all the land of Egypt. Come down therefore to me and tarry not.<verse eID="Gen.45.9"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.45.11" sID="Gen.45.11"/>And I will nourish thee there, (for the famine will continue five years longer) that thou and thy sons and all that belong to thee may not be consumed.<verse eID="Gen.45.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.12" sID="Gen.45.12"/>Behold your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth which speaketh to you.<verse eID="Gen.45.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.13" sID="Gen.45.13"/>Therefore tell my father all my glory in Egypt and all that you see; and make haste and bring my father down hither.<verse eID="Gen.45.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.14" sID="Gen.45.14"/>Then he fell upon the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept upon him.<verse eID="Gen.45.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.15" sID="Gen.45.15"/>And Benjamin wept on his neck. And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. And after that his brothers conversed with him.<verse eID="Gen.45.15"/></p>

<verse osisID="Gen.45.23" sID="Gen.45.23"/>And he sent the like presents to his father together with ten asses which carried some of all the good things of Egypt, and ten mules loaded with bread for his father on the journey.<verse eID="Gen.45.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.24" sID="Gen.45.24"/>And he dismissed them: And as they were departing, he said to them, See that you do not fall out by the way.<verse eID="Gen.45.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.45.25" sID="Gen.45.25"/>So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Chanaan to their father Jacob<verse eID="Gen.45.25"/>

<chapter osisID="Gen.47" sID="Gen.47"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.1" sID="Gen.47.1"/>So Joseph went and told Pharao saying, My father and my brothers with their flocks and their herds and all that belong to them are come from the land of Chanaan; and lo! they are in the land of Gesem.<verse eID="Gen.47.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.2" sID="Gen.47.2"/>And he took of his brothers five men and presented them before Pharao.<verse eID="Gen.47.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.3" sID="Gen.47.3"/>And Pharao said to Joseph's brothers, What is your occupation? and they
said to Pharao, Thy servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.<verse eID="Gen.47.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.4" sID="Gen.47.4"/>Moreover they said to Pharao, We are come to sojourn in this land, because there is no pasture for thy servants' cattle, for the famine hath been great in the land of Chanaan. Now therefore let us sojourn in the land of Gesem. And Pharao said to Joseph, Let them dwell in the land of Gesem; and if thou knowest any men of ability among them, make them overseers of my cattle.<verse eID="Gen.47.4"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.5" sID="Gen.47.5"/>Now when Jacob and his sons came into Egypt to Joseph and Pharao king of Egypt heard of it he said to Joseph, Thy father and thy brothers are come to thee,<verse eID="Gen.47.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.6" sID="Gen.47.6"/>behold the land of Egypt is before thee, settle thy father and thy brothers in the best of the land.<verse eID="Gen.47.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.7" sID="Gen.47.7"/>And when Joseph introduced his father Jacob and presented him before Pharao and Jacob had blessed Pharao,<verse eID="Gen.47.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.8" sID="Gen.47.8"/>Pharao said to Jacob, How many are the years of the days of thy life?<verse eID="Gen.47.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.9" sID="Gen.47.9"/>And Jacob said to Pharao, The days of the years of my life which I am now
sojourning are a hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life. They have not reached to the days of the years of the life of my fathers which they sojourned.<verse eID="Gen.47.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.10" sID="Gen.47.10"/>And when Jacob had blessed Pharao he went out from him.<verse eID="Gen.47.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.11" sID="Gen.47.11"/>And Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land of Ramesses, as Pharao had ordered.<verse eID="Gen.47.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.12" sID="Gen.47.12"/>And Joseph supplied his father and his brothers and all his father's household with a certain portion of corn for each person.<verse eID="Gen.47.12"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.13" sID="Gen.47.13"/>Now there was no food in the land, for the famine prevailed exceedingly; and both the land of Egypt and the land of Chanaan fainted by reason of the famine.<verse eID="Gen.47.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.14" sID="Gen.47.14"/>And Joseph collected all the money which was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Chanaan for the corn which they bought and which he dealt out to them. And Joseph brought all the money to Pharao's house.<verse eID="Gen.47.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.15" sID="Gen.47.15"/>And when all the money was gone, out of the land of Egypt and out of the land of Chanaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, Give us bread. Must we die in thy presence because we have no money?<verse eID="Gen.47.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.16" sID="Gen.47.16"/>Thereupon Joseph said to them, Bring your cattle, and I will give you bread for your cattle if your money be gone.<verse eID="Gen.47.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.17" sID="Gen.47.17"/>So they brought their cattle to Joseph, and he gave them bread for their horses and for their flocks and for their herds and for their asses and
supplied them with bread that year for all their cattle.<verse eID="Gen.47.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.18" sID="Gen.47.18"/>When that year was ended they came to him the next year and said, Perhaps we may be rejected by our lord: for as our money is gone and our stock and cattle are transferred to thee our lord, there is indeed nothing left us in the presence of our lord, but our persons and our lands.<verse eID="Gen.47.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.19" sID="Gen.47.19"/>That we therefore may not die in thy presence and the land become a waste, purchase us and our land for bread, and we with our lands will be
servants to Pharao. Give us seed that we may sow and live and not die. So the land will not become desolate.<verse eID="Gen.47.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.20" sID="Gen.47.20"/>Upon this Joseph purchased all the land of the Egyptians for Pharao. For the Egyptians sold their land to Pharao, because the famine prevailed over them. Thus the land became Pharao's,<verse eID="Gen.47.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.21" sID="Gen.47.21"/>and he reduced the people to a state of vassalage from one border of Egypt to the other,<verse eID="Gen.47.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.22" sID="Gen.47.22"/>save the land of the priests only. This Joseph did not buy; because Pharao had assigned them a gratuitous portion, and they ate the portion which Pharao assigned them. Therefore they did not sell their land.<verse eID="Gen.47.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.23" sID="Gen.47.23"/>Then Joseph said to all the Egyptians, Behold I have this day purchased you and your land for Pharao. Take seed and sow the land.<verse eID="Gen.47.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.24" sID="Gen.47.24"/>And of the products thereof you shall give Pharao the fifth. And the other four parts shall be your own to sow the land, and to be food for you and all your families.<verse eID="Gen.47.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.25" sID="Gen.47.25"/>And they said, Thou hast saved our lives. We have found favour in the
sight of our lord, and we will be servants to Pharao.<verse eID="Gen.47.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.26" sID="Gen.47.26"/>So Joseph enjoined upon them the giving a fifth to Pharao as a statute which continueth even to this day in all the land of Egypt, excepting only the land of the priests. That did not belong to Pharao.<verse eID="Gen.47.26"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.27" sID="Gen.47.27"/>Thus Israel became sojourners in the land of Egypt in the district of Gesem, and they had possessions therein and increased and multiplied exceedingly.<verse eID="Gen.47.27"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.28" sID="Gen.47.28"/>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. And all the days of the years of his life were a hundred and forty seven years.<verse eID="Gen.47.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.29" sID="Gen.47.29"/>Now when the time of Israel's death drew nigh he sent for his son Joseph and said to him, If I have found favour in thy sight, put thy hand under my thigh and thou shalt deal kindly and truly with me, that thou wilt not bury me in Egypt;<verse eID="Gen.47.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.30" sID="Gen.47.30"/>but let me sleep with my fathers. Therefore thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their sepulchre. And he said I will do as thou hast said.<verse eID="Gen.47.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.47.31" sID="Gen.47.31"/>And he said, Swear to me. So he sword to him. And Israel bowed down on the head of his staff.<verse eID="Gen.47.31"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.47"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.48" sID="Gen.48"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.1" sID="Gen.48.1"/>After this when it was told Joseph, Thy father is sick, he took his two
sons Manasses and Ephraim and went to Jacob.<verse eID="Gen.48.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.2" sID="Gen.48.2"/>And when they told Jacob saying, Behold thy son Joseph is coming to thee, Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed.<verse eID="Gen.48.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.3" sID="Gen.48.3"/>And Jacob said to Joseph, My God appeared to me at Louza in the land of Chanaan and blessed me<verse eID="Gen.48.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.4" sID="Gen.48.4"/>and said, Behold I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and make thee a multitude of nations, and I will give thee this land even to thy seed after thee for a perpetual possession.<verse eID="Gen.48.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.5" sID="Gen.48.5"/>Now therefore thy two sons, who have been born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, are mine. Ephraim and Manasses, like Reuben and Symeon, shall be mine.<verse eID="Gen.48.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.6" sID="Gen.48.6"/>And the issue which thou mayst have after this shall go by the name of their brothers. They shall be enrolled in their inheritances.<verse eID="Gen.48.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.7" sID="Gen.48.7"/>Now when I came out of Syrian Mesopotamia Rachel thy mother died in the land of Chanaan, just as I drew near the race ground of Chabratha on the way to Ephratha. So I buried her in the way of the race ground the same is Bethlehem.<verse eID="Gen.48.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.8" sID="Gen.48.8"/>Then Israel seeing the sons of Joseph said, Who are these with thee?<verse eID="Gen.48.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.9" sID="Gen.48.9"/>And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. Whereupon Jacob said, Bring them near to me that I may bless them.<verse eID="Gen.48.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.10" sID="Gen.48.10"/>Now Israel's eyes were dim by reason of old age and he could not see clearly. And when he brought them near to him, he kissed them and embraced them.<verse eID="Gen.48.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.11" sID="Gen.48.11"/>And Israel said to Joseph, Lo! was I not deprived of thy presence? yet behold God hath shewn me even thy seed.<verse eID="Gen.48.11"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.12" sID="Gen.48.12"/>Then Joseph took them from his knees; and when they had made obeisance to him with their face to the ground,<verse eID="Gen.48.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.13" sID="Gen.48.13"/>Joseph taking his two sons, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left and Manasses in his left hand towards Israel's right, brought them near to him.<verse eID="Gen.48.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.14" sID="Gen.48.14"/>But Israel stretching out his right hand laid it on Ephraim's head (now he was the youngest) and his left hand on Manasses' head crossing his hands.<verse eID="Gen.48.14"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.15" sID="Gen.48.15"/>And he blessed them and said, The God whom my fathers Abraham and Isaak worshipped—the God who hath fed me from my youth to this day—<verse eID="Gen.48.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.16" sID="Gen.48.16"/>the Angel who delivered me from all evils, bless these children! And let them be called by my name and by the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaak; and may they be increased to a great multitude on the earth!<verse eID="Gen.48.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.17" sID="Gen.48.17"/>Now when Joseph saw that his father put his right hand on Ephraim's head, it appeared amiss to him; and he took hold of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to the head of Manasses.<verse eID="Gen.48.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.18" sID="Gen.48.18"/>And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father: for this is the first born, put thy right hand on his head.<verse eID="Gen.48.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.19" sID="Gen.48.19"/>But he refused and said, I know; my son; I know. This indeed will be a people and will be exalted. But his younger brother will be greater than he; and his seed will be a multitude of nations.<verse eID="Gen.48.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.20" sID="Gen.48.20"/>And he blessed them that day and said, By you Israel will bless saying, God make thee like Ephraim and Manasses. So he put Ephraim before Manasses.<verse eID="Gen.48.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.21" sID="Gen.48.21"/>Then Israel said to Joseph, Lo I die. But God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers.<verse eID="Gen.48.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.48.22" sID="Gen.48.22"/>Now to thee exclusively above thy brothers, I give Sikima, which I took out of the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.<verse eID="Gen.48.22"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.48"/>

<verse osisID="Gen.49.28" sID="Gen.49.28"/>All these were the twelve sons of Jacob. And these were the words which their father spoke to them when he blessed them, each according to his peculiar blessing.<verse eID="Gen.49.28"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.49.29" sID="Gen.49.29"/>And when he had blessed them he said, I am going to be added to my people, and you shall bury me with my fathers,<verse eID="Gen.49.29"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.49.30" sID="Gen.49.30"/>in the cave which is in the field of Ephron the Chettite, in the double cave which is over against Mambre in the land of Chanaan—the cave which Abraham bought of Ephron the Chettite for the possession of a burying place.<verse eID="Gen.49.30"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.49.31" sID="Gen.49.31"/>There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaak and Rebekka his wife. There Leia was buried—<verse eID="Gen.49.31"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.49.32" sID="Gen.49.32"/>in the field namely in the cave in it, which was purchased of the children of Chet.<verse eID="Gen.49.32"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.49.33" sID="Gen.49.33"/>And when Jacob had finished this charge to his sons he drew up his feet into the bed and gave up the ghost and was added to his people.<verse eID="Gen.49.33"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.49"/>
<chapter osisID="Gen.50" sID="Gen.50"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.1" sID="Gen.50.1"/>Then Joseph fell upon his father's face and bewailed him and kissed him.<verse eID="Gen.50.1"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.2" sID="Gen.50.2"/>And Joseph gave orders to his servants the embalmers to embalm his father. And when the embalmers had embalmed Israel,<verse eID="Gen.50.2"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.3" sID="Gen.50.3"/>and compleated his forty days; (for this is the time allowed for embalming) the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.<verse eID="Gen.50.3"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.4" sID="Gen.50.4"/>And when the days of mourning were over, Joseph spoke to the princes of Pharao saying, If I have found favour in your sight, speak for me to Pharao and
say,<verse eID="Gen.50.4"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.5" sID="Gen.50.5"/>My father adjured me saying, In the tomb which I cut out for myself in the land of Chanaan there thou shalt bury me. Now therefore let me go up and bury my father and I will return again.<verse eID="Gen.50.5"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.6" sID="Gen.50.6"/>And Pharao said to Joseph, Go up and bury thy father as he adjured thee.<verse eID="Gen.50.6"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.7" sID="Gen.50.7"/>So Joseph went up to bury his father. And there went up with him all the
servants of Pharao and the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,<verse eID="Gen.50.7"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.8" sID="Gen.50.8"/>and all Joseph's family and his brothers and all his lather's household and his kindred. But their flocks and herds they left in the land of Gesem.<verse eID="Gen.50.8"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.9" sID="Gen.50.9"/>There went up also with him chariots and horsemen, so that the camp was very large.<verse eID="Gen.50.9"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.10" sID="Gen.50.10"/>And when they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is on the bank of the Jordan, they mourned for him with a very great and sore lamentation. And he continued the mourning for his father seven days.<verse eID="Gen.50.10"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.11" sID="Gen.50.11"/>And when the inhabitants of the land of Chanaan saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, This is a great grief to the Egyptians. For this cause they called its name Grief of Egypt. It is on the bank of the Jordan.<verse eID="Gen.50.11"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.12" sID="Gen.50.12"/>When his sons had done this for him—<verse eID="Gen.50.12"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.13" sID="Gen.50.13"/>when they had carried him to the land of Chanaan and buried him in the double cave; the cave which Abraham bought for the possession of a burying place from Ephron the Chettite over against Mambre,<verse eID="Gen.50.13"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.14" sID="Gen.50.14"/>then Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren and those who went up with him to bury his father.<verse eID="Gen.50.14"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.15" sID="Gen.50.15"/>Now when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Perhaps Joseph may bear us a grudge and requite us for all the ills which we have done to him.<verse eID="Gen.50.15"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.16" sID="Gen.50.16"/>So they came to Joseph and said, Our father before he died adjured us
saying,<verse eID="Gen.50.16"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.17" sID="Gen.50.17"/>Thus shall you say to Joseph. Forgive them their iniquity and their sin for having done thee evil. Now therefore forgive the iniquity of the servants of the God of thy father. And while they were speaking to him, Joseph wept.<verse eID="Gen.50.17"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.18" sID="Gen.50.18"/>And they came near to him and said, We are thy servants,<verse eID="Gen.50.18"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.19" sID="Gen.50.19"/>upon which Joseph said to them, Fear not, for I am God's servant.<verse eID="Gen.50.19"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.20" sID="Gen.50.20"/>You indeed consulted against me for evil: but God determined concerning me for good, to bring to pass as at this day, that much people might be nourished.<verse eID="Gen.50.20"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.21" sID="Gen.50.21"/>Moreover he said to them, Be not afraid. I will continue to nourish you and your families. So he comforted them, and spoke affectionately to them,<verse eID="Gen.50.21"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.22" sID="Gen.50.22"/>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his brothers and all his father's family. And when Joseph had lived a hundred and ten years<verse eID="Gen.50.22"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.23" sID="Gen.50.23"/>and saw Ephraim's children to the third generation; and the children of Machir the son of Manasses were also dandled on his knees;<verse eID="Gen.50.23"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.24" sID="Gen.50.24"/>Joseph spoke to his brothers, saying, I die, but God will assuredly visit you and conduct you out of this land into the land which God with an oath gave to our fathers, Abraham, Isaak and Jacob.<verse eID="Gen.50.24"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.25" sID="Gen.50.25"/>And Joseph adjured the children of Israel saying, In the visitation wherewith God will visit you, you shall carry my bones hence with you.<verse eID="Gen.50.25"/>
<verse osisID="Gen.50.26" sID="Gen.50.26"/>So Joseph died being a hundred and ten years old, and when they had embalmed him they put him into a coffin in Egypt.<verse eID="Gen.50.26"/></p><chapter eID="Gen.50"/>
