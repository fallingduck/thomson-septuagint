<chapter osisID="Eccl.1" sID="Eccl.1"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.1" sID="Eccl.1.1"/>The words of the preacher the son of David, king of Israel in Jerusalem.<verse eID="Eccl.1.1"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.2" sID="Eccl.1.2"/>Vanity of vanities, said the preacher. Vanity of vanities. All is vanity.<verse eID="Eccl.1.2"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.3" sID="Eccl.1.3"/>What lasting advantage hath a man by all the labour with which he toileth under the sun?<verse eID="Eccl.1.3"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.4" sID="Eccl.1.4"/>One generation passeth away and another cometh. But the earth hath continually kept its station.<verse eID="Eccl.1.4"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.5" sID="Eccl.1.5"/>The sun riseth and the sun setteth and cometh round to his place.<verse eID="Eccl.1.5"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.6" sID="Eccl.1.6"/>Rising there he marcheth southward, then wheeleth about to the north. The wind wheeleth in circuits, and in its circuits it returneth.<verse eID="Eccl.1.6"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.7" sID="Eccl.1.7"/>All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not filled. To the place whence the rivers come, thither they return to continue their course.<verse eID="Eccl.1.7"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.8" sID="Eccl.1.8"/>All these considerations are wearisome. Man cannot recount them: nor can the eye be satisfied with seeing; nor the ear filled with hearing.<verse eID="Eccl.1.8"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.9" sID="Eccl.1.9"/>What is that which hath been? The very same which shall be. And what is that which hath been done? The very same which shall be done: for there is nothing entirely new under the sun.<verse eID="Eccl.1.9"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.10" sID="Eccl.1.10"/>Who can speak and say, Behold this is entirely new. It hath been already in the ages past which were before us.<verse eID="Eccl.1.10"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.11" sID="Eccl.1.11"/>There is no remembrance of former things: and of those things which shall happen hereafter, there will be no remembrance among them who shall be born at a remote period.<verse eID="Eccl.1.11"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.12" sID="Eccl.1.12"/>I the preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem;<verse eID="Eccl.1.12"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.13" sID="Eccl.1.13"/>and I applied my heart to seek and make diligent search by wisdom concerning all the things which are done on the earth. Because God hath assigned to the sons of men painful employment, that they may be kept employed,<verse eID="Eccl.1.13"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.14" sID="Eccl.1.14"/>I took a view of all the different sorts of work which are done under the
sun. And behold they are all vanity and vexation of spirit.<verse eID="Eccl.1.14"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.15" sID="Eccl.1.15"/>That which is crooked cannot be made straight, nor can wants be numbered.<verse eID="Eccl.1.15"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.16" sID="Eccl.1.16"/>I communed with my heart, saying, Behold I am become great and have made advances in wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. And I have applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge.<verse eID="Eccl.1.16"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.17" sID="Eccl.1.17"/>And my mind hath taken a view of many things—of wisdom and knowledge—of parables and science. I have found by experience that this also is indeed vexation of spirit.<verse eID="Eccl.1.17"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.1.18" sID="Eccl.1.18"/>Because by much wisdom there is much knowledge; and he who addeth to his knowledge will add to his sorrow;<verse eID="Eccl.1.18"/></p><chapter eID="Eccl.1"/>
<chapter osisID="Eccl.2" sID="Eccl.2"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.1" sID="Eccl.2.1"/>I said in my heart, Come now let me try thee with pleasure. Take a view of that considered as a good. But behold this also is vanity.<verse eID="Eccl.2.1"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.2" sID="Eccl.2.2"/>To laughter I said, It is madness; and to mirth, What is this thou art doing?<verse eID="Eccl.2.2"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.3" sID="Eccl.2.3"/>Now I had examined whether my mind could lead my flesh to wine; and my mind had led it with wisdom, retaining a command over pleasure, until I should
see of what sort that good is, which the sons of men are to pursue under the
sun, all the days of their life.<verse eID="Eccl.2.3"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.4" sID="Eccl.2.4"/>I enlarged my plan of operations. I built me houses. I planted me vineyards.<verse eID="Eccl.2.4"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.5" sID="Eccl.2.5"/>I made me gardens and orchards and planted therein all sorts of fruit trees.<verse eID="Eccl.2.5"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.6" sID="Eccl.2.6"/>I made me pools of water, to water from them my blooming nurseries.<verse eID="Eccl.2.6"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.7" sID="Eccl.2.7"/>I purchased men servants and maid servants; and had servants born in my family. And my stock of herds and flocks was great above all who were before me in Jerusalem.<verse eID="Eccl.2.7"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.8" sID="Eccl.2.8"/>I collected also for myself silver and gold and the choicest treasures of kings and countries. I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men—a butler and the requisites to entertainments.<verse eID="Eccl.2.8"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.9" sID="Eccl.2.9"/>And I was great and surpassed all who had been before me in Jerusalem; and
still my wisdom continued with me.<verse eID="Eccl.2.9"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.10" sID="Eccl.2.10"/>And whatever mine eyes desired I withheld not from them, nor did I restrain my heart from all my pleasure. Because my heart had been gladdened with all my labour, (now this was my portion from all my labour)<verse eID="Eccl.2.10"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.11" sID="Eccl.2.11"/>therefore I looked back on all the works which my hands had done, and on the labour with which I had toiled to execute them; and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there is no lasting advantage under the sun.<verse eID="Eccl.2.11"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.12" sID="Eccl.2.12"/>Then I looked back to take a view of wisdom and madness and folly. In all the particulars which formed this deliberation (for who is the man equal to a compleat investigation)<verse eID="Eccl.2.12"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.13" sID="Eccl.2.13"/>I saw indeed that there is an advantage in wisdom above folly, like the advantage of light above darkness.<verse eID="Eccl.2.13"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.14" sID="Eccl.2.14"/>The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness. Nevertheless I knew that one event will happen to them all.<verse eID="Eccl.2.14"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.15" sID="Eccl.2.15"/>Therefore I said in my heart, As the same event will happen to me as happeneth to the fool, why have I studied wisdom? Why communed abundantly with my heart? Because even this is vanity; (since out of an abundance the fool
speaketh)—<verse eID="Eccl.2.15"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.16" sID="Eccl.2.16"/>because there is no remembrance forever of the wise man more than of the fool (seeing the days are now coming when all shall be for gotten and the wise must die as well as the fool)<verse eID="Eccl.2.16"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.17" sID="Eccl.2.17"/>therefore I hated the whole of this life; because the work which was done under the sun was toilsome to me—because all are vanity and vexation of
spirit:<verse eID="Eccl.2.17"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.18" sID="Eccl.2.18"/>and I hated all this labour of mine for which I am toiling under the sun; because I must leave it to a man who is coming after me;<verse eID="Eccl.2.18"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.19" sID="Eccl.2.19"/>and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? Now if he hath power over all my labour for which I have toiled and in which I have displayed wisdom under the sun; surely this is vanity.<verse eID="Eccl.2.19"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.20" sID="Eccl.2.20"/>Then I turned about that my heart might state distinctly in every labour of mine in which I had toiled under the sun;<verse eID="Eccl.2.20"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.21" sID="Eccl.2.21"/>that here is a man whose labour hath been with wisdom and with knowledge, and with ability; and there is a man to whom, though he did not labour fur him, he shall give his portion. Surely this is vanity and a great vexation—<verse eID="Eccl.2.21"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.22" sID="Eccl.2.22"/>That such is the case with another man by all his labours and the vexation of his heart with which he toileth under the sun,<verse eID="Eccl.2.22"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.23" sID="Eccl.2.23"/>that all his days are days of sorrow and his employment grief, and even at night his heart hath no rest. Surely this is vanity.<verse eID="Eccl.2.23"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.24" sID="Eccl.2.24"/><note placement="foot"><reference type="annotateRef">2:24 An objection.</reference></note> Hath not a man something good which he can eat and drink and which he can point out to his soul as a good by his labour?<verse eID="Eccl.2.24"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.25" sID="Eccl.2.25"/><note placement="foot"><reference type="annotateRef">2:25 The answer.</reference></note> With respect to that I saw indeed that even this is from the hand of God;for who can eat or who can drink without him?<verse eID="Eccl.2.25"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.2.26" sID="Eccl.2.26"/>For to the man who is good in his sight he hath given wisdom and knowledge and joy; and to the sinner he hath given the trouble of gathering and heaping up to give to him who is good in the sight of God. So that this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.<verse eID="Eccl.2.26"/></p><chapter eID="Eccl.2"/>
<chapter osisID="Eccl.3" sID="Eccl.3"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.1" sID="Eccl.3.1"/>Time is for all things: but there is a particular portion of time for every particular affair under heaven—<verse eID="Eccl.3.1"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.2" sID="Eccl.3.2"/>a time to be born and a time to die—a time to plant and a time to root up what was planted—<verse eID="Eccl.3.2"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.3" sID="Eccl.3.3"/>a time to kill and a time to heal—a time to pull down and a time to build up—<verse eID="Eccl.3.3"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.4" sID="Eccl.3.4"/>a time to weep and a time to laugh—a time to mourn and a time to dance—<verse eID="Eccl.3.4"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.5" sID="Eccl.3.5"/>a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together—a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing—<verse eID="Eccl.3.5"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.6" sID="Eccl.3.6"/>a time to seek and a time to lose—a time to keep and a time to throw away—<verse eID="Eccl.3.6"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.7" sID="Eccl.3.7"/>a time to rend and a time to sew—a time to be silent and a time to speak—<verse eID="Eccl.3.7"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.8" sID="Eccl.3.8"/>a time to love and a time to hate—a time of war and a time of peace.<verse eID="Eccl.3.8"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.9" sID="Eccl.3.9"/>What is the lasting advantage of the agent from the things in which he laboureth?<verse eID="Eccl.3.9"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.10" sID="Eccl.3.10"/>I have taken a collective view of all the business which God hath assigned to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.<verse eID="Eccl.3.10"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.11" sID="Eccl.3.11"/>All the things which he made, considered as a whole, are good in his time. But with regard to all things considered as one whole, to them he hath assigned the whole age; so that no man can find out the work which God hath done from beginning to end.<verse eID="Eccl.3.11"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.12" sID="Eccl.3.12"/>I have found that there is no good in them<verse eID="Eccl.3.12"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.13" sID="Eccl.3.13"/>(I mean in regard to every man who eateth and drinketh, and can see good in all his labour) if there is not a gift of God that he may be made glad and do good in his life.<verse eID="Eccl.3.13"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.14" sID="Eccl.3.14"/>I have found that all the things which God hath made shall continue their age; there is no adding to it nor taking from it; and that God hath acted that they may be awed at his presence.<verse eID="Eccl.3.14"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.15" sID="Eccl.3.15"/>What hath been is now; and what are to be have already been; and God will find out him who is persecuted:<verse eID="Eccl.3.15"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.16" sID="Eccl.3.16"/>and yet I saw under the sun a place of judgment; was the wicked there? and a place for the just; was the pious there?<verse eID="Eccl.3.16"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.17" sID="Eccl.3.17"/>Then I said in my heart God will judge the whole class of the righteous, and the whole class of the wicked. For there is a time for every thing; and he is there over all the work.<verse eID="Eccl.3.17"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.18" sID="Eccl.3.18"/>I communed with my heart concerning a saying of the sons of men, "That God distinguisheth them." Now in order to shew that they themselves are beasts,<verse eID="Eccl.3.18"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.19" sID="Eccl.3.19"/>that at least which befalleth man, befalleth them; and that which befalleth the beast befalleth man. The same event happeneth to both. As the one dieth, so doth the other. And they have all one breath. What advantage then hath man over the beast? None: for all are vanity.<verse eID="Eccl.3.19"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.20" sID="Eccl.3.20"/>They are all for one place. They were all from dust: and to dust they
shall all return.<verse eID="Eccl.3.20"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.21" sID="Eccl.3.21"/>And who hath seen the breath of the sons of men whether it ascendeth upwards; and the breath of the beast, whether it descendeth downwards into the earth?<verse eID="Eccl.3.21"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.3.22" sID="Eccl.3.22"/>So I saw that there is nothing good in the works of man, but that by which he can be made glad; for that is his portion, for who will bring him to
see what will be after him?<verse eID="Eccl.3.22"/></p><chapter eID="Eccl.3"/>
<chapter osisID="Eccl.4" sID="Eccl.4"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.1" sID="Eccl.4.1"/>Then I turned and took a view of all the different sorts of oppression under the sun; and behold the tear of the oppressed and they have no comforter. Though from the hand of oppressors some have relief; yet others have no comforter.<verse eID="Eccl.4.1"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.2" sID="Eccl.4.2"/>Therefore I praised the whole body of the dead—those who were already dead, above the living—those who are still alive:<verse eID="Eccl.4.2"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.3" sID="Eccl.4.3"/>but better than both is he who hath never been—who hath not seen all the evil work which is done under the sun.<verse eID="Eccl.4.3"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.4" sID="Eccl.4.4"/>In the review of labour in general, I took a view in particular of manly exertion in executing. Because this causeth a man to be envied by his neighbour, this therefore is vanity and vexation of spirit.<verse eID="Eccl.4.4"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.5" sID="Eccl.4.5"/>The fool folded his hands and devouring his flesh said,<verse eID="Eccl.4.5"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.6" sID="Eccl.4.6"/>"Better is one handful of rest than two handfuls of labour and vexation of
spirit."<verse eID="Eccl.4.6"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.7" sID="Eccl.4.7"/>Then I turned and took a view of a vanity under the sun;<verse eID="Eccl.4.7"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.8" sID="Eccl.4.8"/>Here is a single individual who hath no second; at least he hath neither
son nor brother, yet there is no end to all his labour. His eye is not
satisfied with riches, yet doth he say, For whom do I labour and deprive my
soul of good? Surely this is vanity and a sore vexation.<verse eID="Eccl.4.8"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.9" sID="Eccl.4.9"/>two are better than one. They have a better reward for their labour.<verse eID="Eccl.4.9"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.10" sID="Eccl.4.10"/>For if they chance to fall the one can raise up his fellow. But alas for him who is alone, when he falleth and hath not another to raise him up.<verse eID="Eccl.4.10"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.11" sID="Eccl.4.11"/>Again if two lie together they have warmth: but how can one be warm who is alone?<verse eID="Eccl.4.11"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.12" sID="Eccl.4.12"/>Again though one should be strong the two may withstand him, and a three fold cord cannot easily be broken.<verse eID="Eccl.4.12"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.13" sID="Eccl.4.13"/>Better is a poor and wise subject than an old and foolish king who hath not yet learned how to conduct himself;<verse eID="Eccl.4.13"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.14" sID="Eccl.4.14"/>for out of prison he may come to reign. Because even in his own kingdom he was needy,<verse eID="Eccl.4.14"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.15" sID="Eccl.4.15"/>I took a view of the whole body of the living who were walking under the
sun with the youth second in rank who is to succeed him.<verse eID="Eccl.4.15"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.4.16" sID="Eccl.4.16"/>There is no end of all the people—of all who resorted to them. Yet they who come last will have no joy in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.<verse eID="Eccl.4.16"/></p><chapter eID="Eccl.4"/>
<chapter osisID="Eccl.5" sID="Eccl.5"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.1" sID="Eccl.5.1"/>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and let thy sacrifice be a readiness to hear rather than the oblation of fools. Because they are not
sensible that they do amiss,<verse eID="Eccl.5.1"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.2" sID="Eccl.5.2"/>be thou not rash with thy mouth; nor let thy heart be hasty to utter a word in the presence of God. Because God is in the heaven above, and thou art on the earth, let thy words there fore be few.<verse eID="Eccl.5.2"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.3" sID="Eccl.5.3"/>Because a dream cometh by much temptation, and a fool's voice with many words;<verse eID="Eccl.5.3"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.4" sID="Eccl.5.4"/>when thou vowest a vow to God delay not the performance of it. For in fools there is no fixed will. Pay thou therefore what thou vowest.<verse eID="Eccl.5.4"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.5" sID="Eccl.5.5"/>It is better not to vow, than to vow and not perform.<verse eID="Eccl.5.5"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.6" sID="Eccl.5.6"/>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin, nor say in the presence of God, It was an inadvertence, that God may not be provoked to wrath by thy voice, and destroy the works of thy hands,<verse eID="Eccl.5.6"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.7" sID="Eccl.5.7"/>because it was with a multitude of dreams and vanities, and many words that thou fearest God.<verse eID="Eccl.5.7"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.8" sID="Eccl.5.8"/>If thou seest a frivolous accusation of a poor man, and a rigorous exaction of judgment and justice in a country, marvel not at the matter. Because there is a high one over a high one to watch, and high ones are for these things,<verse eID="Eccl.5.8"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.9" sID="Eccl.5.9"/>and the profit of land is for every one, a king is appendant to the cultivated field.<verse eID="Eccl.5.9"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.10" sID="Eccl.5.10"/>A lover of silver cannot be satisfied with silver; but did any one ever love what the abundance of this produceth? Surely this is vanity.<verse eID="Eccl.5.10"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.11" sID="Eccl.5.11"/>By an abundance of wealth they who consume it are multiplied. And what is the mighty advantage of the owner from it? That he hath the first sight of it with his eyes?<verse eID="Eccl.5.11"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.12" sID="Eccl.5.12"/>The sleep of the slave is sweet whether he eateth little or much. But the fulness of the rich suffereth him not to sleep.<verse eID="Eccl.5.12"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.13" sID="Eccl.5.13"/>There is a weakness which I have seen under the sun: riches kept by one for his descendant to his own hurt.<verse eID="Eccl.5.13"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.14" sID="Eccl.5.14"/>Yet these riches acquired with grievous vexation shall perish, and he hath begotten a son, and there is nothing in his hand.<verse eID="Eccl.5.14"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.15" sID="Eccl.5.15"/>As he came naked out of his mother's womb, he shall turn about and go as he came. He shall take nothing by his labour to go with him in his hand.<verse eID="Eccl.5.15"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.16" sID="Eccl.5.16"/>Surely this a grievous weakness; for as he came, so he must depart. What then is his lasting advantage, for which he laboureth in vain;<verse eID="Eccl.5.16"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.17" sID="Eccl.5.17"/>and for which all his days are in darkness and mourning, and much grief and weakness and repining?<verse eID="Eccl.5.17"/></p>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.18" sID="Eccl.5.18"/>Behold I have seen a good which is comely, namely to eat and drink, and to have a good enjoyment in all the labour with which one toileth under the
sun, the number of the days of his life which God hath given him; for this is his portion.<verse eID="Eccl.5.18"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.19" sID="Eccl.5.19"/>And every man indeed to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and granted him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, hath by means of his being made glad in his labour, this further gift of God,<verse eID="Eccl.5.19"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.5.20" sID="Eccl.5.20"/>that he will not much remember the days of his life, because God occupieth him with the joy of his heart.<verse eID="Eccl.5.20"/></p><chapter eID="Eccl.5"/>
<chapter osisID="Eccl.6" sID="Eccl.6"/>
<p>
<verse osisID="Eccl.6.1" sID="Eccl.6.1"/>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men—<verse eID="Eccl.6.1"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.6.2" sID="Eccl.6.2"/>a man to whom God giveth riches and wealth and glory, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he can desire; but God granteth him not a power to eat thereof. In as much as a stranger is to devour it, this is vanity and grievous infirmity.<verse eID="Eccl.6.2"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.6.3" sID="Eccl.6.3"/>Though a man should beget a hundred children and live many years, if during that multitude of years which his days shall continue, his soul shall not be satisfied with an enjoyment of good, and he hath got no burying place, I conclude that an Abortive is better than he.<verse eID="Eccl.6.3"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.6.4" sID="Eccl.6.4"/>Grant that it came in vanity and goeth away in darkness; with darkness also his name shall be covered!<verse eID="Eccl.6.4"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.6.5" sID="Eccl.6.5"/>It indeed never saw the light; and he never knew rest: it hath an advantage over him<verse eID="Eccl.6.5"/>
<verse osisID="Eccl.6.6" sID="Eccl.6.6"/>though he had lived the revolutions of a thousand years, if he never enjoyed good. Do not all go to one place?<verse eID="Eccl.6.6"/></p>
<p>
