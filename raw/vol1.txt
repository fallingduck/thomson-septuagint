   Ch. I.                            GENESIS.
     I.     IN the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.
    2 And the earth was invisible and unfurnished and there was
       darkness over this abyss ; and a breath of God was brought on
    3 above the water.        And God said, " Let there be Light ; " and
    4 there was light.      And God saw the light that it was good.           And
       God made a separation between the light and the darkness.
    5 And God called the light day ; and the darkness he called night.
       And there was an evening and there was a morning.                      The
       first day.
    6      Then God said, " Let there be a firmament in the midst of
       the water ; and let it make a separation between water and wa-
     7 ter."   And it was so.     God made the firmament ; and God made
       a separation between the water which was below the firmament
    8 and the water which was above the firmament.               And God called
       the firmament, heaven.        And God saw that it was good.            And
       there was an evening and there was a morning.            Thesecond day.
    9      Then God said, "Let the water which is below the hea-
       ven be gathered into one receptacle and let the dry land ap-
       pear."    And it was so.         The waters which were below the
       heaven were gathered into their several collections, and the dry
   10 land appeared.        And God called the dry land, earth ; and the
       collections of the waters he called, seas.         And God saw that it
   11 was good.       And God said, "Let the earth produce the grassy
       plant with sowing seed according to kind and according to like-
       ness, and the fruit bearing tree together with the fruit, the seed
       of which is in it according to kind, upon the earth."               And it
   12 was so.      The earth indeed produced the grassy plant with
       sowing seed according to kind and according to likeness, and
       the fruit tree together with fruit, the seed of which is in it,
       according to kind, in the earth.            And God saw that it was
   13 good.     And there was an evening and there was a morning.
       The third day.
   14      Then God said, "Let there be luminaries in the firma-
       ment of heaven, to give light on the earth ; to make a separa-
       tion between the day and the night : and let them be for signs
   15 and for seasons and for days and for years ; and let them be
       for an illumination in the firmament of heaven so as to shine
   16 on the earth."        And it was so.         God indeed made the two
       great luminaries, the greater luminary for the regulations of
           VOL. I.                         A
                                   GENESIS.
       Ch. I.
           the day, and the lesser luminary, with the stars, for the regu-
        17 lations of the night.And God placed them in the firmament of
           heaven so as to shine on the earth, and to regulate the day and
           the night, and to make a division between the light and the
        18 darkness.  And God saw that it was good.    And there was an
           evening and there was a morning.   The fourth day.
        20    Then God said, " Let the waters produce moving crea-
           tures having life ; and winged creatures flying above the earth
        21 in the open firmament of heaven."    And it was so.   God in-
           deed made the great sea monsters and every species of moving
           animals which the waters produced according to their kinds,
        22 and every winged flying creature according to kind.       And
           God saw that they were good.    And God blessed them saying,
           " Increase and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let
        23 flying creatures be multiplied on the earth."And there was an
           evening and there was a morning.   The fifth day.
        24    Then God said, " Let the earth produce animal life accord-
           ing to kind ; four footed beasts and reptiles and wild beasts
        25 of the earth according to kind."   And it was so.  God indeed
           made the wild beasts of the earth according to their kind, and
           the cattle according to their kind, and all the reptiles of the
           earth according to kind.   And God saw that they were good.
        26 Then God said, " Let us make man after our image and after
           a likeness ; and let them have dominion over the fishes of the
           sea, and the fowls of the air, and the cattle, and the whole
        27 earth, and all the reptiles which creep on the earth." So God
           made man.   After an image of God he made him.     A male and
        28 a female he made them.    And God blessed them saying, " In-
           crease and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it ; and have
           dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air,
           and all the cattle, and all the earth, and all the reptiles which
        29 creep on the earth."  Moreover God said, " Behold I have given
           you every seed bearing plant, the sowing seed which is on the
           whole earth, and every tree which hath in itself the fruit of se-
        30 minal seed, you shall have for food : And to all the beasts of
           the earth, and to all the birds of the air, and to every reptile on
           the earth, which hath in it animal life, I have also given every
        31 green herb for food."   And it was so.  And God saw all the
                                                                                                                        ;

            things which he had made, and behold they were very good.
            And there was an evening and there was a morning.                                           The sixth
            day.
      II.         Thus were finished the heaven and the earth and all the ar-
        2 rangement of them.                      And God finished on the sixth day these
            his works which he made ; and on the seventh day he desisted
        3 from all these works of his which he made.                                      And God blessed
            the seventh day and hallowed it ; because on it he rested from
            all these works of his which God had taken occasion to make.
        4         This is the genealogy of heaven and earth.                                 When theywere
        5 made,â€”on the day when the Lord God had made the heavenand
            the earth, and all the verdure of the field, before it was on the
            earth, and every herb of the field, before it sprang up, (for God
        6 had not rained on the earth, nor was there a man to till it
            but a fountain ascended out of the earth and watered the whole
        7 face of the ground,) then God formed the man, dust from the
            earth, and breathed upon his face a breath of life, and the man
        8 became a living soul.                     And God planted a garden in Eden to-
            wards the east and placed there the man whom he had made.
        9 And God caused to spring up there also out of that ground
            every tree beautiful to the sight and good for food, and the tree
            of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree for the pur-
            pose of knowing what was to be known of good and evil.
      10          Now a river issueth out of Eden to water the garden:
      11 thence it is divided into four heads.                                  The name of the first is
            Physon.           This is that which encircleth the whole country
            Evilat, where there is gold, and the gold of that country is good.
      12 There also is the carbuncle and the Prasian stone.                                               And the
      13 name of the second river is Geon.                              This is that which encircleth
      14 the whole country of Ethiopia.                              And the third river is Tigris.
            This is that which floweth down over against the Assyrians.
            And the fourth river is Euphrates.
      15          And the Lord God took the man whom he had made, and
            placed him in this garden of pleasure to work it and to watch.
       16 And the Lord God gave a charge to Adam, saying, "Of
            every tree which is in the garden for food, thou mightest have
      17 eaten ; but from this tree, that you may know good and evil, you
            must not eat of it.                On the day you eat of it, by death you shall
            die."
         Ch. III.                     GENESIS.
         18     Then the Lord God said, "It is not good that the man
            should be alone : let us make for him a helper correspondent
         19 to himself."   Now God had also formed out of the earth all
            the beasts of the field, and all the birds of the air, and brought
            them to Adam to see what he would call them.            And what-
            ever Adam called every living creature, that was its name.
         20 So Adam gave names to all the cattle, and to all the fowls of the
            air, and to all the wild beasts of the field.But for Adam there was
         21 not found a helper like himself.    Then God brought an ecstasy
            upon Adam and caused him to sleep, and took one of his ribs
         22 and filled up flesh instead thereof.    And God built up the rib,
            which he took from Adam, into a woman, and brought her to
         23 Adam.    And Adam said, " This now is bone of my bones, and
            flesh of my flesh, let her be called Woman."      Because she was
         24 taken out of her man, therefore a man is to leave his father
            and his mother and cleave to his wife, and they two shall be
            one flesh.
         III.   Now the two, both Adam and his wife were naked, and
            were not ashamed.      But the serpent was the wisest of all the
            beasts on the earth which the Lord God had made, and the
            serpent said to the woman, " Why hath God said, you must
          2 not eat of every tree of the garden ? "       And the woman said
          3 to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we
            may eat ; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle
            of the garden, God said, You shall not eat of it, nor touch it,
          4 that you may not die."       xincl the serpent said to the woman,
          5 " You will not by death die.      For God knew that in the day
            you eat thereof, your eyes would be opened and you would
          6 be like gods knowing good and evil."         And the woman saw
            that the tree was good for food ; and that it is delightful to see
            with the eyes ; and that to exercise understanding is comely,
            so having taken some of the fruit thereof, she ate and gave
          7 also to her husband with her. And when they had eaten, the eyes
            of them both were opened, and they perceived that they were
            naked.    And they sewed together fig leaves and made for
          8 themselves girdles.    And when they heard the sound of the
            Lord God walking in the garden in the evening, both Adam
            and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord
            God, among the trees of the garden.
                               GENESIS.
    Ch. III.
     9    And the Lord God called Adam and said to him, " Adam,
       where art thou?"    And he said to him, "I heard the sound
       of thee walking in the garden and I was afraid, because I am
    11 naked, and I hid myself."      And God said to him, "Who
       told thee that thou art naked, if so be thou hast not eaten of
       the tree of which alone I commanded thee not to eat of this ? "
    12 And xVdam said, " The woman whom thou gavest to be with
    13 me, she gave me of the tree and I did eat."      And the Lord
       God said to the woman, " Why hast thou done this ? "       And
    14 the woman said, " The serpent seduced me and I ate."       And
       the Lord God said to the serpent, "Because thou hast done
       this, thou art cursed from all the cattle and from all the beasts
       which are upon the earth.     Upon thy breast and belly thou
    15 shalt go and shalt eat earth all the days of thy life.And I will
       put enmity between thee and the woman ; and between thy
    16 seed and her seed.    He will wound thy head, and thou wilt
       wound his heel."   And to the woman he said, " I will great-
       ly multiply thy sorrows and thy anguish.    With sorrows thou
       shalt bear children and to thy husband shall be thy recourse,
    17 and he shall rule over thee."    And to Adam he said, " Be-
       cause thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten
       of the tree of which alone I commanded thee not to eat, the
       ground is cursed by thy labours.     With sorrows thou shalt
    18 eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns and thistles it shall
       cause to spring up for thee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the
    19 field.  By the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread until
       thou return into the earth out of which thou wast taken ; for
       earth thou art and to earth thou shalt return."
    20     And Adam called the name of his wife Life, because she
    21 was to be the mother of all the living.     And the Lord God
       made for Adam and his wife garments of skin and cloathed
       them.
    22     And God said, " Behold Adam was made like one of us to
       know good and evil.   And now perhaps he may stretch forth his
       hand and take of the tree of life and eat, so shall he live for
    23 ever."  So the Lord God sent him out of the garden of plea-
       sure to till the ground out of which he was taken.    And when
       he put Adam out he caused him to dwell over against the gar-
       den of pleasure and stationed the Cherubim and the whirling
       flame of fire to keep the way to the tree of life.
         Ch. IV.                        GENESIS.
         IV.      AdcI Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and
          2 brought forth Cain, and said, " I have gotten a man from
             God."    And again she brought forth his brother Abel.           And
             Abel became a keeper of sheep, and Cain tilled the ground.
          3 And when in process of time Cain brought of the fruits of the
             earth a sacrifice to the Lord, and Abel also brought, he indeed
             of the firstlings of his flock even some of the fattest of them,
          5 God looked upon Abel and on his gifts ; but upon Cain and
             upon his sacrifices he did not look with regard.           Thereupon
             Cain was exceedingly grieved and his countenance became
          6 dejected.    And the Lord God said to Cain, "Why art thou
             become sorrowful and why is thy countenance dejected? ''
           7 Though thou hast offered right, yet if thou hast not rightly
             divided, hast thou not sinned?        Be composed.     To thee shall
             be his recourse, and thou shalt rule over him."
          8      Then Cain said to Abel his brother, "Let us go into the
             plain."   And when they were in the plain, Cain rose upon Abel
           9 his brother and slew him.       And when the Lord God said to
             Cain, " Where is Abel thy brother ? " he said I know not.         Am
         10 I my brother's keeper?          Then the Lord said, "What hast
             thou done?      The voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me
         11 out of the ground.       Now therefore thou art cursed from this
             land, which hath opened its mouth to receive the blood of thy
             brother from thy hand.      When thou tillest the ground, it will
             not henceforth yield thee its strength.     Thou shalt be in a state
         12 of anguish and terror in this land.''     And Cain said to the Lord
             God, " Is my fault too great to be forgiven ?         If thou castest
             me out this day from the face of this land and I be hid from
             thy presence and be in a state of anguish and terror in the land,
             it will come to pass that whoever findeth me will kill me."
         15 And the Lord said to him, " Not so.          Whosoever killeth Cain
             shall suffer seven fold vengeance." And the Lord God gave a sign
         16 to Cain, that whoever found him would not kill him.            So Cain
             went out from the presence of God and dwelt in the land of
         17 Naid over against Eden.         And Cain knew his wife, and she
             conceived and brought forth Enoch.        And he employed himself
             in building a city and he called the city Enoch after his son's
         18 name.      And to Enoch was born Gaidad ; and Gaidad begot
             Maleleel, and Maleleel begot Mathousala, and Mathuusala be-
                                                                                          ;

    Ch. V.
         2:ot    Lamech.         And Lamech took to himself two wives.                                 The
         name of the first was Aria ; and the name of the second Sella.
    20 And Ada bore Jobel.                    He was the father of them who dwell in
         tents, feeding cattle.               And the name of his brother was Jon-
    22 bal.        He was the inventor of the psaltery and kithara.                                As for
          Sella, she also bore Thobel, and he was a smith, a manufac-
         turer of brass and iron ; and the sister of Thobel was Noe-
         ma.      And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sella,
    23 " Hearken to my voice, ye wives of Lamech,
         " Listen attentively to my words.
         " For have I slain a man that I should be wounded,
          " And a young man that I should be hurt ?
    24 " For seven fold vengeance was to be taken for Cain
         " But for Lamech will be taken seventy times seven."
    25         And Adam knewEve his wife and she conceived and brought
         forth a son and called his name Seth, saying, " For God hath
    26 raised up for me another seed in the place of Abel whom Cain
         slew."        And Seth had a son ; and he called his name Enos.
         He hoped that he would invoke the name of the Lord God.
    V.         This is the genealogy of men.
      2 On the day God made Adam, he made him after an image
         of God.          A male and a female he made them, and blessed
         them.         And he called his name Adam on the day he made
      3 them.         And Adam lived two hundred and thirty years, and
         begot a son after his own likeness and after his own image,
      4 and called his name Seth.                        And the days of Adam which he
         lived after he begot Seth were seven hundred years, and he
      5 begot sons and daughters.                     So all the days of Adam which he
          lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
      6        And Seth lived two hundred and five years and begot
          Enos.       And Seth lived after he begot Enos seven hundred and
          seven years and begot sons and daughters.                             So all the days of
          Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.
      9        And Enos lived one hundred and ninety years and begot
          Kaiuan.         And Enos lived after he begot Kainan seven hun-
          dred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.                                    So all
         the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he
          died.
    12         And Kainan lived one hundred and seventy years and be-
       Ch. VI.                   GENESIS.
           got Maleleel. And Kaiuan lived after he begot Maleleel seven
          hundred and forty years and begot sons and daughters.So all
          the days of Kainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he
          died.
       15    And Maleleel lived one hundred and sixty five years and
          begot Jared. And Maleleel lived after he begot Jared seven hun-
          dred and thirty years and begot sons and daughters.  So all
          the days of Maleleel were eight hundred and ninety five years,
          and he died.
       18    And Jared lived one hundred and sixty two years and begot
          Enoch.   And Jared lived after he begot Enoch eight hundred
          years and begot sons and daughters. So all the days of Jared
          were nine hundred and sixty two years, and he died.
       21    And Enoch lived one hundred and sixty five years and be-
          got Mathousala.  And Enoch continued to please God after
          he begot Mathousala two hundred years and begot sons and
          daughters.  And all the days of Enoch were three hundred
          and sixty 1iYe years. And Enoch continued to please God
          and was not found, for God translated hirn.
       25    xlnd Mathousala lived one hundred and eighty seven
          years and begot Lamech.   And Mathousala lived after he be-
          got Lamech seven hundred and eighty two years and begot
          sons and daughters. So all the days of Mathousala which he
          lived were nine hundred and sixty nine years, and he died.
       28     And Lamech lived one hundred and eighty eight years
          and begot a son and called his name Noe, saying " This child
          will cause us to cease from our works and from the toils of
          our hands and from the earth which the Lord hath cursed.
          And Lamech lived after he begot Noe five hundred and sixty
          Hve years and begot sons and daughters.  So all the days of
          Lamech were seven hundred and fifty three years, and he
          died.
       VI.   And Noe was five hundred years old and he had three
          sons, Sem, Cham, Japheth.   And it came to pass when the
          men began to be multiplied on the earth and daughters were
        2 born to them, that the sons of God seeing the daughters of
          men that they were fair, took to themselves wives of all whom
        3 they chose : then the Lord God said, " My breath must not
          continue in these men to this age, because they are flesh ; their
                                                                                                                       ;;
      Ch. VI.                                         GENESIS.
            days however, shall be an hundred and twenty years."                                                 Now
            there were giants on the earth in those days, and after that
            when the sons of God went in unto the daughters of men and
        5 they bore to them.                    These were the giants of old, the men of
            renown.         So when the Lord God saw that the wickedness of
            the men on the earth was multiplied, and that every one was
        6 in his heart studiously and continually bent upon evils, God
        7 was grieved that he had made man on the earth.                                                And God
           came to a determination and said, "I will blot out from the
           face of this earth the man I have made, both man and beast
       8 both reptiles and birds of the air.                                For I am grieved that I
           made them.              But Noe found favour in the sight of the Lord
           God.
       9         Now these are the generations of Noe.                                     Noe was a just
           man; and being perfect in the tenor of his life, Noe pleased
     10 God.           And Noe had three sons, Sem, Cham, Japheth.                                              Now
     11 the earth was corrupt before God ; and the earth was filled
     12 with iniquity.                And God beheld the earth and it was corrupt.
           Because all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth
     13 therefore the Lord God said to Noe, " The time of every
           man is come before me.                       Because the earth is filled with ini-
           quity by their means, therefore behold I am going to destroy
           them and the earth.                     Make therefore for thyself an ark of
     14 squared timber.                  Thou shalt make the ark with small apart-
     15 ments, and pitch it on the inside and outside with pitch.                                               And
          in this manner thou shalt make the ark.                                      Three hundred cu-
          bits shall be the length of the ark, and fifty cubits the breadth,
     16 and thirty cubits the height thereof.                              In building the ark thou
          shalt narrow the breadth and finish it above at a cubit.                                              And
          thou shalt make the door of the ark out of the sides.                                               With
     17 lower, second and third stories thou shalt make it.                                             Now be-
          hold I am going to bring a flood of water upon the earth to
          destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven,
          and all that are on the earth shall die ; and I will establish my
    18 covenant with thee.                   Thou therefore shalt go into the ark, thou
    19 and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons' wives with thee.
          And of all the cattle, and of all the reptiles, and of all the wild
          beasts, even of all flesh thou shalt bring into the ark a pair of
    20 every sort, that thou mayest nourish them with thyself.                                               They

                   shall be a male with a female.                        Of all the winged fowls ac-
                   cording to kind, and of all the cattle according to kind, and
                  of all the reptiles which creep on the earth according to their
                  kind, pairs of every sort shall come to thee, a male with a fe-
             21 male, to be fed with thee.                   Thou shalt therefore take to thee of
                  all the varieties of food which you eat, and collect it to thee,
                  and it shall be for thee and for them to eat."
             22         And ISToe did all that the Lord God commanded him
             VII. and when he had done so, the Lord God said to Noe,
                  " Go into the ark, thou and all thy family, for I have seen thee
              2 righteous before me in this generation.                             And of all the cattle
                  which are clean take thee seven pairs, a male with a female,
                  and of all the cattle which are not clean, pairs, a male with a
              3 female ; and of the birds of the air which are clean, seven pairs,
                  male and female, and of all the birds which are not clean,
              4 pairs, male and female, to nourish seed on the earth.                                     For yet
                  seven days and I bring rain upon the earth forty days and for-
                  ty nights.         And I will blot out from the face of the whole earth
                  all the raised which I made."
              5        And Noe did all that the Lord God commanded him.
              6 Now Noe was six hundred years old when the deluge of water
              7 came on the earth.                   And Noe and his sons and his wife and
              8 his sons' wives with him went into the ark on account of the
                  water of the deluge.                And of the fowls which were clean and
                  of the fowls which were not clean, and of the beasts which were
                  clean and of the beasts which were not clean, and of all the rep-
              9 tiles which creep on the earth, pairs went to Noe into the ark,
             10 a male with a female as God commanded Noe.                                        And it came
                  to pass after the seven days that the water of the flood came
                  on the earth.
            11         In the six hundredth year of Noe's life, the second month
                  and twenty seventh day of the month, on that day all the foun-
            12 tains        of    the     abyss were burst open and the cataracts of
                  heaven were opened, and there came rain on the earth forty
             13 days and forty nights.                  On that day Noe, Sem, Cham, Japheth,
                  the sons of Noe, and Noe's wife and the three wives of his
             14 sons with him went into the ark : And all the beasts accord-
                  ing to kind, and all the cattle according to kind, and every
             15 moving reptile on the earth according to its kind, and every
      Cb. VIII.                          GENESIS.
          kind of winged fowls went to Noe into the ark, two and two,
          a male and a female of all flesh in which is the breath of life.
     16 And when they, that were going in, male and female of all
          flesh, had gone in as God commanded Noe, the Lord God
     17 shut up the ark on the outside, and the deluge came on the
          earth forty days and forty nights.          And the water increased ex-
          ceedingly and lifted up the ark, and it was raised up from
     IS the earth.       And the water prevailed and was exceedingly in-
          creased on the earth : And the ark was borne up above the
     19 water.      Still the water prevailed more and more on the earth
         and covered all the high mountains which were under the
     20 heaven.       Fifteen cubits above was the water raised when it
     21 had covered all the high mountains.              And all animate flesh on
          the earth of fowls and cattle and wild beasts and every moving
     22 reptile on the earth and every man died.                  Every thing which
         hath the breath of life, even every thing which was on the dry
     23 land died.       It swept away every thing raised up, which was
         on the face of the earth, man and cattle and reptiles and the
         fowls of the air.       They were swept away from the earth, and
         Noe alone was left and they who were with him in the ark.
     24 And the water was raised up above the earth a hundred and
         fifty days.
     VIII.     Now God had remembered Noe and all the beasts and
         all the cattle and all the fowls and all the reptiles which creep,
         even all that were with him in the ark ; and God brought a
      '2 wind over the earth and aswaged the water.                   And the foun-
         tains of the abyss were shut up and also the cataracts of heaven
         and the rain from heaven was stayed : and the water running
      3 off from the earth subsided ; so after a hundred and fifty days
         the water was lessened and the ark grounded in the seventh
         month and twenty seventh day of the month upon the nioun-
      4 tains of Ararat.        Still the water continued to lessen till the
      5 tenth month.        And in the tenth month, on the first, day of the
      6 month, the tops of the mountains appeared.                   And after forty
         days Noe opened the window which he had made in the ark
      7 and sent forth a raven ; and it having gone out did not return
      8 till the water was dried up from the earth.             So he sent out after
      9 it the dove to see if the water was abated from the earth ; and
         the dove finding no resting place for its feet, returned to him
             IX.
        Oh.                         GENESIS.
            into the ark, for the water was on the whole face of the earth.
            Therefore he stretched out his hand and brought it to him in-
        10 to the ark.   And having waited yet other seven days, he again
        11 sent forth the dove out of the ark, and towards evening the
            dove returned to him and it had an olive leaf, a dry leaf in its
        12 bill.  So Noe knew that the water was abated from the earth.
           And having waited yet other seven days he again sent out the
           dove, and it returned to him no more.
        13     And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year of
           Noe's life, in the first month and the first day of the month,
           the   water was gone from the earth ;        and Xoe removed
           the covering of the ark which he had made, and he saw
        14 that the water was gone from the face of the earth.         And
        15 in the second month and twenty seventh day of the month,
           when the ground was dry, the Lord God spoke to Noe saying,
        16 " Go forth out of the ark, thou and thy wife and thy sons and
           thy sons' wives with thee, and all the beasts which are with
        17 thee, even all flesh both of fowls and cattle.     Take out al-
            so with thee every moving reptile on the earth, and be ye
        18 fruitful and multiplied on the earth."     So Noe and his wife
        19 and his sons and his sons' wives with him went out.     And all
            the beasts and all the cattle and every fowl and every moving
            reptile on the earth according to their kind, went forth out of
        20 the ark.   And Noe built an altar to the Lord, and took of all
            the cattle which are clean and of all the fowls which are clean,
        21 and offered them up upon the altar for a whole homage offering.
            And the Lord God smelled a sweet savour, and the Lord
            God having come to a determination, said, "I will no more
            curse the ground on account of the works of men.        Though
            the imagination of man is studiously bent upon evils from his
            youth, I will not on that account again smite all living flesh,
        22 as I have done.    While the earth continueth, seed time and
            harvest, cold and heat, summer and spring, with a succession
            of day and night shall not cease."
        IX.    Then God blessed Noe and his sons and said to them,
            " Increase and multiply and replenish the earth and have do-
         2 minion over it ; and let the fear and the dread of you be upon
            all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds of the air, and
            on all that move on the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea.
    <l.. IX.                      GENESIS.
       To you I have subjected them and every reptile which hath
     3 life.  They shall be food for you.     As the herb of grass I have
     4 given you them all.     But flesh with the blood of life you shall
     5 not eat.   For with regard to your blood of your lives, I will in-
       deed make inquisition for it at the hand of the beasts.      At the
       hand of a man's brother I will make inquisition for the life of
     6 man.   He who sheddeth man's blood shall for it have his own
     7 blood poured out ; for in an image of God I have made man.       As
       for you therefore be fruitful and multiply and replenish the
       earth and have dominion over it."
     8     Moreover God spoke to Noe and to his sons with him,
     9 saying, "Behold I renew my covenant with you and with your
    10 seed after you, and with every living creature with you both
       birds and cattle and with all the wild beasts of the earth which
    11 are with you ; even with all that went out of the ark.    And this
       covenant of mine I will lay before you.     All flesh shall no more
       die by the water of a deluge ; nor shall there any more be a
       deluge of water to destroy the whole earth."
    12     Moreover the Lord God said to Noe, "This is the sign of
       the covenant which I make between me and you and every
       living creature which is with you for perpetual generations.
    13 This bow of mine I place in the clouds and it shall be for a
    14 sign of the covenant between me and the earth, so that when
    15 I cause clouds to gather upon the earth, the bow shall be seen
       in the cloud ; and I will remember this my covenant, which is
       between me and you and every life living in all flesh, and the
    lb* water shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.    When
       this my bow shall be in the cloud, I will look that I may re-
       member the everlasting covenant between me and the earth
    17 and life living in all flesh which is on the earth.       Therefore
       (said God to Noe) this is the sign of the covenant which I have
       made between me and all flesh which is on the earth."
    18     Now these were the sons of Noe who went out of the ark,
    19 Sem, Cham, and Japheth.       And Cham was the father of Cha-
       naan.   These three are the sons of Noe.     From them men were
       disseminated over the whole earth.
    20     Now Noe being a husbandman, began and planted a vine-
    21 yard, and he drank of the wine and was intoxicated and un-
    22 covered in his house.     And Cham, the father of Chanaan, saw

            the nakedness of his father, and going out told his two brothers
         23 without.    Whereupon Sem and Japheth took the garment and
             put it on both their shoulders, and went backwards and covered
             the nakedness of their father ; and their faces being turned
         24 from him, they did not see the nakedness of their father.
         25     And when Noe recovered from the wine and knew what
             his younger son had done to him, he said,
                 " Ah devoted Chanaan !
                 " To his brethren he will be a domestic servant.
         26 Moreover he said,
                 " Blessed be the Lord God of Sem :
                 " And let Chanaan be his domestic servant.
         27      " God make room for Japheth !
                 " And let him dwell in the tents of Sem,
                 " And let Chanaan become his servant."
         28      And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty
         29 years.    So all the days of Noe were nine hundred and fifty
             years, and he died.
         X.      Now these are the generations of the sons of Noe, Sem,
             Cham, Japheth, to whom sons were born after the flood.
          2      The sons of Japheth, Gamer, and Magog and Madoi and
          3 Jovan and Elisa and Thobel and Mosoch and Theiras.                And
             the sons of Gamer, Aschanaz and Kiphath and Thorgama.
          4 And the children of Jovan, Elisa, and the Tharsians, Ketians,
           5 Khodians.    By these the islands of the nations were set apart in
             their land, each according to their language in their tribes and
             in their nations.
           6     And the sons of Cham ; Chous, and Mesrain, Phoud and
           7 Chanaan.     And the children of Chous ; Saba and Evila and Sa-
           8 batha and Begma and Sabathaka.         And the sons of Begma ; Sa-
           9 ba and Dadan.      And Chous begot Nebrod.        He began to be a
             giant on the earth.      He was a giant hunter before the Lord
             God.    For this cause they say, " Like Nebrod the giant hunter
          10 before the Lord."      And the beginning of his kingdom was
             Babylon and Orech and Archad and Chalane in the land of
          11 Senaar.    From this land Assour went out and builded Ninive
          12 and the city Booboth and Chalach and Dase, between Ninive
          1  and Chalach.     This was the great city.    And Mesrain begot the
             Tjoudieims and the Nephthaleims, and the Enemetieims, and
  Ch. XL                   GENESIS.
  14 Labieiins, and Patrosonieirus, and the Chasmonieinis (from
     whom descended the Philistines) and the Gapkthorieiins.And
  15 Chanaan begot Sidon his first born, and Chettaius, and Jebou-
     saius and Amoraius and Gergasaius and Evaius and Arou-
     kaius and Asennaius and Aradius and Samaraius and Amathius.
  19 And after this the tribes of the Chananites were dispersed.
     And the boundaries of the Chananites were from Sidon ex-
     tending to Gerara and Gaza, thence extending to Sodom and
  20 Gomorra, Adama and Seboin even to Dasa.    These were the
     children of Cham in their tribes according to their languages
     in their countries and in their nations.
  21    To Sem also children were born even to him who was the
     father of all the children of Eber and the brother of Japheth
  22 who was older than he.  The children of Sem were Elam and
  23 Assour and Arphaxad and Loud and Aram and Kainan.    And
     the children of Aram were Ouz and Oul and Gater and Mo-
  24 soch. And Arphaxad begot Kainan; and Kainan begot Sala;
  25 and Sala begot Eber; and to Eber were born two sons, the
     name of the one was Phaleg, because in his days the earth was
  26 divided, and his brother's name was Jektan.And Jektan be-
  27 got Elmodad and Saleth and Sarmoth and Jarach and Odorra
  28 and Aibel and Dekla and Eval and Abimael and Saba and
  29 Oupheir and Evila and Jobab. All these were the children of
  30 Jektan, and their dwelling was from Massa extending to Sap-
  31 hera a mountain of the east. These were the children of Sem
     in their tribes according to their tongues in their countries
     and in their nations.
  32     These were the tribes of the children of Noe according to
      their descents and according to their nations.From these
      were peopled the different countries of the nations on the
      earth after the flood.
   XL    Now when the whole earth was of one lip and all had one
    2 voice, it came to pass as they were moving from the east that
      they found a plain in the land of Sennaar and settled there.
    3 And they said one to another, Come let us make bricks and
      bake them with fire. Now the bricks served them for stone
    4 and their mortar was asphaltus.And they said, Come, let us
      build for ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which shall
      be up to heaven ; and let us make a name for ourselves before
                                                                                                                               ;

                5 we be scattered on the face of the whole earth.                                         And the Lord
                    came down to see the city and the tower which the children
                6 of men were building.                       And the Lord said, Behold they are all
                    of one race and one lip.                   And this they have begun to do ; and
                   now nothing will fail of all which they may determine to do.
                7 Come, let us go down and there confound their language that
               8 they may not understand each other's voice.                                              So the Lord
                   dispersed them from that place over the face of the whole
               9 earth, and they left off building the city and the tower.                                                 For
                   this cause the name of it was called Confusion, because
                   there the Lord confounded the lips of the whole earth, and
                   dispersed them thence over the face of the whole earth.
             10          Noav these are the generations of Sem.                                    Sem was an hun-
             11 dred years old when he begot Arphaxad the second year after
                   the flood.          And Sem lived after he begot Arphaxad five hun-
                   dred years and begot sons and daughters, and died.
             12          And Arphaxad lived a hundred and thirty five years and
                   begot Kainan.              And Arphaxad lived after he begot Kainan four
                   hundred years and begot sons and daughters, and died.
             13          And Kainan lived a hundred and thirty years and begot
                   Sala ; and Kainan lived after he begot Sala three hundred and
                   thirty years and begot sons and daughters, and died.
             14          And Sala lived a hundred and thirty years and begot Eber
                   and Sala lived after he begot Eber three hundred and thirty
                  years and begot sons and daughters, and died.
             16         And Eber lived a hundred and thirty four years and begot
                  Phaleg ; and Eber lived after he begot Phaleg two hundred
                  and seventy years and begot sons and daughters, and died.
             18         And Phaleg lived a hundred and thirty years and begot
                  Ragau; and Phaleg lived after he begot Kagau two hundred
                  and nine years and begot sons and daughters, and died.
            20          And Ragau lived a hundred and thirty two years and be-
                  got Serouch ; and Ragau lived after he begot Serouch two
                  hundred and seven years and begot sons and daughters, and
                  died.
            22          And Serouch lived a hundred and thirty years and begot
                  Nachor; and Serouch lived after he begot Nachor two hun-
                  dred years and begot sons and daughters, and died.
            24          And Nachor lived a hundred and seventy nine years and
                                                                                                              ;

      Ch.
           begot Tharra ; and Nachor lived after lie begot Tharra a hun-
           dred and twenty five years and begot sons and daughters,
           and died.
      26         And Tharra lived seventy years and begot Abram and
           Nachor and Arran.
      27         Now these are the generations of Tharra.                                 Tharra be^ot
      28 Abram and Nachor and Arran ; and Arran begot Lot.                                              And
           Arran died in the presence of his father Tharra in the land in
      29 which he was born in the country of the Chaldees.                                   And Abram
           and Nachor took themselves wives.                              The name of Abram's
           wife was Sara, and the name of Nachor's wife, Malcha, a
           daughter of Arran, who was the father of Malcha and the fa-
      30 ther of Jescha.              And Sara was barren and did not bear chil-
      31 dren.        And Tharra took Abram his son and Lot the son of
           Arran, his grand son, and Sara his daughter in law, the wife of
           his son Abram, and led them out of the country of the Chal-
      32 dees to go to the land of Chanaan.                             But when they came to
           Charran he took up his abode there.                         And in the land of Char-
           ran, all the days of Tharra were two hundred and five years.
           And Tharra died in Charran.
     XII.         Now the Lord said to Abram, Depart from thy land and
           from thy kindred and from the house of thy father and come
       2 to the land which I will shew thee, and I will make thee a great
       3 nation ; and I will bless thee and make thy name great, and
          thou shalt be blessed ; and I will bless them, who bless thee
           and those who curse thee I will curse : and by thee all the tribes
       4 of the earth shalt be blessed.                        So Abram went as the Lord
           commanded him, and Lot went with him.                                    Now Abram was
       5 seventy five years old when he came out of Charran.                                            And
           Abram took Sara his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all
           their substance which they possessed, and every living creature
           which they had, and set out from Charran to go to the land of
       6 Chanaan.           And Abram travelled through the land length-
          wise till he came to the place of Sychem to the lofty Oak.
       7 Now the Chananites at that time inhabited that land.                                    And the
          Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him, " To thy seed I
          will give this land."               So Abrambuilt there an altar to the Lord
       8 who appeared to him.                    And from that place he went to the
          mountain east of Baithel and there pitched his tent, having
               vol. i.                                  c
            Ch. XIII.                                        GENESIS.
                  Baithel on the west and Aggai on the east, and built there an
              9 altar to the Lord and invoked the name of the Lord.                                                     And
                  Abram removed and proceeding forward encamped in the wil-
             10 derness.            And there was a famine in the land, so Abram went
                   down to Egypt to sojourn there, because the famine prevailed
             11 in the land.                x\nd when Abram was near entering Egypt, he
                   said to his wife Sara, I know that because thou art a beautiful
             12 woman, it will therefore come to pass that when the Egyptians
                   see thee, they will say, She is his wife, and they will kill me ;
             13 but thee they will save alive.                           Say thou therefore, I am his sis-
                   ter, that it may be well with me on thy account, and my life
             14 will be preserved for thy sake.                                 So when Abram came into
                   Egypt the Egyptians beheld his wife, for she was very beau-
             15 tiful ; and when the princes of Pharaoh saw her they praised
                   her to Pharaoh, and she was brought to Pharaoh's house.
             16 And they treated Abram well for her sake, though he had
                   sheep and oxen and asses and men servants and maid servants
             17 and mules and camels.                          But God visited Pharaoh and his fa-
                   mily with great and grievous plagues because of Sara the wife
             18 of Abram.               And Pharaoh called Abram and said, Why hast
                   thou acted thus with me and didst not tell me that she is thy
             19 wife? Why didst thou say, She is my sister? I indeed took
                   her to be my wife, but now there is thy wife before thee.
             20 Take her and begone.                           And Pharaoh gave strict orders to
                   men touching Abram, to convoy away him and his wife and
                                                                           r                          Egypt with his
                   all that he had.                   So Abram went up out of
                   wife and all his substance, and Lot with him, into the wil-
                   derness.
             XIII.         Now Abram was very rich in cattle and in silver and
                   gold, therefore he proceeded on to the place from which he
                   had come into the wilderness, even to Baithel to the place
                   where his tent formerly was, between Baithel and Aggai, to the
                   place of the altar which he had there built at the first, and
                   there Abram invoked the name of the Lord.
               5         Now Lot who accompanied Abram had flocks and herds
                   and tents, so that the land would not admit of their living to-
               6 gether.           Because their substance was great and the land did
                   not admit of their living together, and there was quarreling
               7 between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of
    Ch. XIV.                GENESIS.
       Lot's cattle, and the Chananites and the Pherezites then inha-
     8 bited that land ; therefore Abram said to Lot, Let there be no
       quarreling between roe and thee, and between my herdsmen
     9 and thy herdsmen, for we are brethren. Behold is not the
       whole land before thee ? Separate from me.If thou incline
       to the left, I will take the right.Or if thou go to the right, I
    10 will go to the left.Then Lot raised his eyes and took a view
       of all the country bordering on the Jordan.For before God
       overthrew Sodom and Goraorra it was all watered till it
       reacheth Zogora, like the paradise of God, and like the land,
    11 of Egypt. So Lot chose for himself all the country bordering
       on the Jordan ; and Lot removed to the eastern border.And
    12 the brothers separated one from the other.And Abram dwelt
       in the land of Chanaan ; and Lot dwelt in a city of the bor-
    13 derers and pitched his tent among the Sodomites, though the
       men of Sodom were wicked and very great sinners in the sight
       of the Lord.
    14    And God said to Abram after Lot had separated from him,
       Kaise thy eyes and look from the place where thou now art,
    15 to the north and south and east and west.For all the land
       which thou seest I will give to thee and thy seed for ever.
    16 And I will make thy seed like the dust of the earth.If any
       can count the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed be num-
    17 bered. Arise and travel through the land, the length and
       the breadth thereof, for to thee I will give it and to thy seed
    18 for ever. Then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt
       near the Oak of Mambre, which was by Chebron, and built
       there an altar to the Lord.
    XIV.    And it came to pass in the reign of Amarphal king of
       Sennaar, and of Arioch king of Ellasar, that Chodollogomar
     2 king of Elam, and Thargal king of nations, made war on Balla
       king of Sodom, and on Barsa king of Gomorra, and on Sen-
       naar king of Adama, and Sumobor king of Seboeim, and the
     3 king of Balak which is Segor.All these met together on the
     4 salt vale, which is now the sea of salt.Twelve years they had
       served Chodollogomar, but in the thirteenth year they revolt-
     5 ed.  And in the fourteenth year came Chodollogomar and the
       kings with him, and having subdued the giants in Astaroth
       and Ivarnain, and mighty nations with them, namely, the Om-
       Ch. XIV.                   GENESIS.
        6 maians who dwelt in the city Save, and the Chorrites on the
          mountain of Seir as far as the pine grove of Pharan, which is
        7 in the wilderness, they turned and came to the fountain of
          Judgment, which is Kades, and smote the princes of Amalek
        8 and the Amorites, who dwelt in Asasonthamar.     Then march-
          ed out the king of Sodom and the king of Goniorra and the
        9 king of Adama and the king of Seboeim and the king of Ba-
          lak, that is Segor, and drew up in array against them for bat-
          tle in the salt vale, against Chodollogomar king of Elam and
          Thargal king of nations, and Amarphal king of Sennaar, and
       10 Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five. Now in this
          salt vale there were wells of Asphaltus. And the king of So-
          dom and the king of Gomorra fled and fell there.    And they
       11 who were left fled to the hilly country.And they took all the
          cavalry of Sodom and Gomorra and all their provisions and
       12 departed.  They took also Lot, Abram's brother's son and his
          substance, when they went off, as he dwelt among the Sodo-
       13 mites.  And one of them who escaped, came and told Abram,
          the traveller, who then dwelt near the oak grove of Mambre
          the Amorite, the brother of Eschol, and the brother of Au-
       14 nan, who were in alliance with Abram.      And when Abram
          heard that his nephew Lot was carried away captive, he num-
          bered his domestics, three hundred and eighteen men, and
       15 pursued them to Dan.   And in the night he and his servants fell
          upon them and smote them, and pursued them even to Choba,
       16 on the left of Damascus.  And he brought back all the cavalry
          of the Sodomites.  He brought back also his nephew Lot and
       17 all his substance and the women and the people. And on his re-
          turn from the slaughter of Chodollogomar and the kings who
          were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him, to the
       18 valley of Sabu which was the king's dale. Melchisedek also the
          king of Salem carried out bread and wine. Now he was a priest
       19 of the most High God, and he blessed Abram, and said, May
          Abram be blessed by God the Most High, who created the
       20 heaven and the earth : And blessed be God the Most High who
       21 hath delivered thy enemies into thy hands.   And Abram gave
          him a tenth of all.  And the king of Sodom said to Abram,
       22 Give me the men, but take the horses for thyself.  Whereupon
          Abram said to the king of Sodom, With this uplifted hand of
                                 GENESIS.
   Ch. KV.
   23 mine I swear by the Lord the God Most High, who created
       the heaven and the earth, that of all which belong to thee I will
   24 not take from a thread to a shoe latchet ; that thou mayest not
       say, I have made Abram rich ; save only what the young men
       have eaten, and the portion of these men who went with
       me, namely, Eschol, Aunan, Mambre.          Let them take a por-
       tion.
   XV.     After these things a word of the Lord came to Abram in
       a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram, I protect thee.      Thy reward
    2 shall be exceedingly great.      Whereupon Abram said,          sove-
       reign Lord, what wilt thou give me, seeing I die childless, and
    3 the son of Masek my servant, this Damascus Eliezerâ€”Then
      xVbram said, seeing thou hast not given me seed, this servant
    4 of mine is to be my heir.     And immediately there came a voice
      of the Lord to him saying, He shall not be thy heir : but one
    5 who shall spring from thee shall be thy heir.      Then he led him
      out and said to him, Look up now to the heaven and count the
    6 stars if thou canst number them.       Then he said, So shall thy
      seed be.   And Abram believed God and it was counted to him
    7 for righteousness.    Then he said to him, I am the God who
      brought thee out of the country of the Chaldees, that I might
    8 give thee this land to inherit it.     Whereupon he said,       sove-
    9 reign Lord, how shall I know that I shall inherit it ?      And the
      Lord said to him, " Take for me a heifer of three years old and
      a she goat three years old and a ram three years old and a tur-
   10 tie dove and a pidgeon."     So he took for him all these and divid-
      ed them in halves and placed the halves opposite to one another,
   11 but the birds he did not divide; but the birds alighted on the
      carcases, on the two halves of them, and Abram sat down with
   12 them.    And at the going down of the sun an ecstacy came on
      Abram, and lo ! a great gloomy horror falleth upon him, and
   13 it was said to Abram, Know assuredly that thy seed shall so-
      journ in a land not their own.     And they shall be enslaved and
   1-1 afflicted and humbled. Four hundred years. But the nation which
      they shall serve I will judge.     And after that they shall come
   15 out hither with much wealth.       Thou indeed shalt go to thy fa-
   16 thers in peace, having been nourished in a good old age.        And
      in the fourth generation they shall be brought back hither.      For
   17 the sins of the Amorites have not yet come to the full.       And as
                       Ch. XVI.                                                                  GENESIS.
                                the sun was setting there was a flash of fire, and lo ! a smok-
                                ing furnace and lamps of fire passed between the halved parts.
                       18 On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying,
                      19 "To thy seed I will give this land from the river of Egypt to the
                                great river Euphrates, the Ivenites and the Kenezites, and
                      20 the Kedmonites and the Chettites and the Pherezites and the
                      21 Eaphaeims and the Amorites and the Chananites and the Evites
                                and the Gergesites and the Jebusites.
                      XYI. Still Sara, the wife of Abram, did not bear him children ;
                          2 so having an Egyptian servant whose name was Agar, Sara
                                said to Abram, Behold the Lord hath shut me up that I may not
                          3 bear.                  Go in therefore to my maid that I may have children by
                                her.            And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sara.                                                                               And Sara the
                                wife of Abram took Agar her Egyptian maid, after Abram had
                                dwelt ten years in the land of Chanaan, and gave her to Abram
                          4 her husband to be his wife.                                                      And he went in unto Agar and she
                                conceived.                       And when she saw that she was with child, her mis-
                          5 tress was contemptible in her sight.                                                                         Whereupon Sara said to
                                Abram, I am injured on thy account.                                                                        I gave thee this maid of
                                mine into thy bosom, and when she seeth that she is with child,
                          6 I am contemptible in her sight.                                                                     God judge between me and
                                thee.              And Abram said to Sara, Behold thy maid is in thy
                                hands, treat her as it seemeth good to thee.                                                                                     Thereupon Sara
                          7 treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence.                                                                                                         But an
                              ' angel of the Lord found her at the fountain of water in the wil-
                          8 dernessâ€”at the fountain in the way to Sour.                                                                                        And the angel of
                                the Lord said to her, Agar, thou servant of Sara, whence
                                comest thou and whither art thou going ?                                                                                And she said I am
                          9 fleeing from the face of my mistress Sara.                                                                                        And the angel of
                                the Lord said to her, Return to thy mistress and submit to her
                       10 authority.                             Moreover the angel of the Lord said to her, I will
                                 multiply thy seed so that it shall not be numbered on account
                       11 of the multitude of it.                                                 Furthermore the angel of the Lord said
                                 to her, Behold thou art with child, and thou shalt bear a son
                                 and shalt call his name Ismael ; for the Lord hath hearkened to
                        12 thy affliction. He will be a wild man. His hands will be against all,
                        13 and the hands of all, against him.                                                                       And he shall dwell in front
                                 of all his brethren."                                        So she called the name of the Lord who
                                 spoke to her, "Thou the God who lookest upon me;" for said
  Oh. XVII.                          GENESIS.
   II she, I saw plainly hiin who appeared to ine ; for this cause
   15 she called the well, The well before which I saw.              Lo ! it is be-
       tween Kades and Barad.            And Agar bore Abrarn a son; and
       Abram called his son whom Agar bore to him Ismael.
   XVII. Now Abram was eighty six years old when Agar bore Ismael
    1 to Abram.      And when Abram was ninety nine years old the
       Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, " I am thy God.
    '1 Be well pleasing in my sight, and be blameless and I will
       establish that covenant of mine between me and thee and
    3 multiply thee exceedingly."          Whereupon Abram fell on his face,
    I and God spake to him saying, " On my part lo ! this is my co-
    5 venant with thee, Thou shalt be the father of a multitude of na-
       tions, and thy name shall no more be called Abram but thy name,
       shall be Abraham ; because I have made thee the father ofmany
    6 nations : And I will increase thee exceedingly, and cause thee to
    7 become nations ; and kings shall spring from thee : And I will es-
       tablish this my covenant with thee and thy seed after thee, through-
       out their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be thy God
    8 and the God of thy seed after thee.             And I will give thee and
       thy seed after thee this land in which thou sojournest ; even all
       the land of Ohanaan for an everlasting possession, and I will be
    9 their God."        Moreover God said to Abraham, " On thy part
       thou shalt keep this my covenant; thou and thy seed after thee
   10 throughout their generations.            And this is the covenant which
       thou shalt keep between me and you, even thy seed after thee
       throughout their generations, Evert/ male of you shall be cir-
   11 cumcised.      Ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and
   12 it shall be for a sign of the covenant between me and you.                And
       the child of eight days old shall be circumcised among you.
       Every male throughout your generations, including the home
       born servant, and him who is bought with money from any
   13 stranger, not of thy seed.         Thyhome born servant and he who is
        bought shall surely be circumcised.          And this my covenant shall
    14 be on your flesh for an everlasting covenant.             And with regard
        to the uncircumcised male, the flesh of whose foreskin shall
        not be circumcised on the eighth day, that soul shall be cut off
        from its family, because it hath broken my covenant."
    15      Moreover God said to Abraham, " Sara thy wife shall not
    16 be called Sara.      Her name shall be Sarah.         And I will bless her
        and give thee a son by her.        And I will bless him.      And he shall
            XVIII.              GENESIS.
        Ch.
        17 become nations, and from him there shall be kings of nations."
           Upon this Abraham fell on his face and smiled, and said in his
        18 heart, To him who is in his hundredth year shall a son be born ?
        19 and shall Sarah bring forth in her ninetieth year?And Abra-
           ham said to God, Let this Ismael live before thee.Whereupon
           God said to Abraham, Nay, behold Sarah thy wife shall bear
           thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaak.And I will
          establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant to
        20 be his God and the God of his seed after him.And as for Is-
           mael, lo ! I have hearkened to thee and behold I have blessed
           him, and I will increase him and multiply him exceedingly.
           He shall beget twelve nations, and I will make him a great na-
        21 tion.But this covenant of mine I will establish with Isaak whom
           Sarah shall bear about this time next year."
        22    And when God had finished talking with him, and bad
        23 ascended from him, Abraham took his son Ismael and all the
           servants born in his family and all those who were bought with
           money, even every male of the men in Abraham's family and cir-
           cumcised their foreskins that very day, as God had ordered
        24 him. Now Abraham was ninety nine years old when he was
        25 circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.And Ismael his son
           was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of
        26 his foreskin.In one and the same clay were circumcised Abra-
           ham and his son Ismael and all the men of his household, both
          his home born servants and those bought from foreign nations.
       XVIII.   Again God appeared to him at the Oak grove of Mambre.
          As he was sitting at the door ofhis tent at noon, he raised his eyes
         2 and looked, and lo ! three men stood above him. And when he saw
          them he ran to meet them from the door ofhis tent ; and having
         3 made obeisance to the ground, he said, My Lord, if I have
        4 found favour in thy sight, pass not by thy servant. Let water, I
          pray thee, be brought and let your feet be washed ; and re-
         5 fresh yourselves under this tree ; and I will fetch bread that
          you may eat.  And after that you may proceed on your jour-
          ney, in as much as you have turned aside to your servant.
         6 Whereupon he said, Do as thou hast said. Then Abraham
          hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said to her, Haste, and mix
          up three measures of fine flour and make cakes on the hearth.
        7 Then Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf tender and good
  Cb. XVIII.                GENESIS.
   8 and gave it to a servant and urged hirn to dress it quickly.And
     he took butter and milk and tbe calf which be bad dressed and
     set it before them, and they ate, and be stood by them under the
   9 tree. And be said to Abraham, Where is Sarah thy wife ? And
  10 Abraham said, Behold ! in the tent.Then he said, I will return
     and come to thee about this time twelve month, and Sarahthy wife
  11 will have a son.And Sarah heard, being at the door of the tent
     behind them. (Now Abraham and Sarah were far advanced in life,
     and it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.)
  12 And Sarah smiled within herself, saying, It hath never been
  13 so with me even to this time, and my lord is old.And the Lord
     said to Abraham, Why did Sarah smile within herself, saying,
  14 Shall I indeed bring forth ? I who am old ? Can any thing be
     impossible with God ? About this time twelve month I will re-
  15 turn to thee, and Sarah shall have a son.Then Sarah denied,
     saying, I did not smile, for she was terrified.And he said to
     her, Nay, but thou didst smile.
  16     Then the men arose and directed their course towards
     Sodom and Gomorra, and Abraham went with them to conduct
  17 them on the way.   And the Lord said, Shall I hide from my
  18 servant Abraham, what I am going to do ?  Abraham shall in-
     deed become a nation great and numerous ; and by him all the
  19 nations of the earth are to be blessed.For I know that he will
     command his children and his household after him, who are to
     keep the ways of the Lord, to execute judgment and justice,
     that the Lord may bring upon Abraham all that he hath spoken
     to him.
  20     Then the Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorra
     hath been multiplied before me, and their sins are exceedingly
  21 great, therefore I am come down to see whether they do to
     each other according to the cry which is come to me ; and if
  22 not, that I may know.  Now the men had turned thence aud
     were gone on to Sodom, but Abraham was still standing before
  23 the Lord.  And Abraham drew near and said, Thou wouldst
     not destroy a righteous with a wicked man !Shall a righteous
  24 man be as the wicked ? Should there be fifty righteous men in
     the city, wilt thou destroy them? Wilt thou not spare the
     whole city for the sake of fifty righteous, if they be there?
  25 Thou canst not do such a thing as this to slay the righteous
        VOL. I.                 D
          Ch. XIX.                            GENESIS.
               with the wicked.       Shall the righteous be as the wicked ? No, no ;
               Thou who judgest the whole earth ; wilt not thou execute
          26 judgment? And the Lord said, If there be among the Sodo-
               mites fifty righteous men in the city, I will spare the whole
          27 city and the whole place for their sake.                 Then Abraham an-
              swered and said, Now I have taken upon me to speak to my
              Lord, I who am but dust and ashes ! But if the fifty righteous
              be lessened to forty five wilt thou for want of the five destroy
          28 the whole city ? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find
          29 there forty five.       And Abraham proceeded farther to speak to
          30 him and said, But if there be found there forty ? And he said
              For the sake of the forty I will not destroy it.                  Then Abra-
              ham said, Wilt thou,            Lord, be offended if I speak? But if
          31 there be found there thirty ? And he said, I will not; destroy
              it, for the sake of the thirty.           Again Abraham said, Since I
              am permitted to speak to the Lord, If twenty be found there ?
          32 And he said I will not destroy it, if I find twenty there.                  And
              Abraham said, Wilt thou,              Lord, be offended, if I speak yet
              once more ? But if ten be found there ? And he said, For
              the sake of ten I will not destroy it.             Then the Lord having
              done speaking to Abraham departed, and Abraham returned to
              his place.
          XIX.        Now in the evening the two angels came to Sodom, and
              Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom, and upon seeing them,
              Lot arose to meet them, and made obeisance with his face to
           2 the ground, and said, I intreat you, my lords, turn aside to
              the house of your servant and tarry all night, and wash your
              feet,   and rising early in the morning, you may proceed on
            3 your journey.       And they said, No, we will lodge in the street.
               Then he pressed them, and they went home with him.                        And
               when they came to his house, he made an entertainment for
               them ; and baked for them unleavened cakes, and they did eat.
            4 But before they went to rest, the men of the city, the Sodo-
               mites, surrounded the house, both young and oldâ€”all the
            5 people in a body.         And they called out Lot and said to him,
               Where are the men who came to thee this night ? Bring them
            6 out to us that we may know them.              Whereupon Lot went out to
            7 them into the porch and shut the door after him : And he said
               to them, You must not brethren, commit such wickedness.
   Oh. XIX.                      GENESIS.
    8 I have two daughters who have not known man ; Let me bring
       out these to you, and use them as you please ; only do no injury
       to these men in as much as they have come under the shelter of
    9 my roof.    And they said to him, Begone there ! Thou earnest
       to sojourn, didst thou also, to be our judge ?      Now therefore
       we will treat thee worse than them.       And they pressed vio-
       lently against the man, Lot ; and came near to break open the
   10 door.   Then the men stretched forth their hands and pulled Lot
      to them into the house and shut the door of the house, and
   11 smote with blindness the men who were at the door of the
       house, both small and great, so that they were tired seeking
   12 the door.   Then the men said to Lot, Hast thou here sons in
       law, or sons or daughters ? or if thou hast any other in this city
       take them out of this place, for we are going to destroy this
   13 place.   For their cry is come up before the Lord, and the Lord
   14 hath sent us to destroy it.    Upon this Lot went out and spoke
       to his sons in law, who had bethrothed his daughters and said,
       Arise and depart from this place ; for the Lord is going to
       destroy this city.   But he seemed to his sons in law to be
   15 mocking.     Now when it was break of day the angels hurried
       Lot, saying, Arise and take thy wife and thy two daughters
       whom thou hast, and get away, lest thou also perish for the
   16 iniquities of this city.    But they were confounded.       So the
       angels took hold of his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the
   17 hands of his two daughters, as the Lord spared him.            And
       having led them out they said, Escape for thy life.     Look not
       back, nor stop in any part of the plain around.     Escape to the
   18 mountains, lest peradventure thou be overtaken.         Thereupon
   19 Lot said to them, I beseech thee,         Lord, since thy servant
       hath found favour in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy
   20 kindness in what thou dost for me to save my life.        I cannot
       escape to the mountains.   Peradventure the calamity may over-
       take me and I shall die.   Behold that city is nigh for me to flee
       to.  It is little and thither I can escape. Is it not little ? And
   21 my soul shall live by thy means.     And he said, Behold I have
       indulged thee also in this matter, so as not to destroy that city
   22 of which thou hast spoken.     Haste therefore to escape thither ;
       for I cannot do any thing till thou get there.     For this cause
       he called the name of that city, Segor.
                                                                                                                                ;
              Ch. XX.                                         GENESIS.
              23          The sun was risen on the earth when Lot entered Segor
              24 and the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorra brimstone
              25 and fire from the Lord out of heaven.                                          And he overthrew
                    these cities, and all the circumjacent country, and all the inha-
                    bitants of those cities, and all the productions of the ground.
              2(3 And Lot's wife having looked back was turned into a pillar
                    of salt.
              27          And Abraham went early in the morning to the place,
              28 where he had stood before the Lord, and he looked towards
                    Sodom and Gomorra and towards the circumjacent plain, and
                    he beheld and lo ! a flame ascended out of the earth like the
              29 smoke of a furnace.                     But when God destroyed all the cities of
                    that neighbourhood he remembered Abraham, and sent Lot
                    out from that destruction.
                          Now when the Lord had destroyed those cities in which
              30 Lot had dwelt, Lot went up out of Segor, and he and his two
                    daughters with him settled in the mountains ; for he was afraid
                    to dwell in Segor.                So he and his two daughters with him took
              31 up their abode in a cave.                          And the elder said to the younger,
                    Our father is old and there is none in this land who will come
              32 in unto us, as is customary in all the earth.                                    Come, let us make
                    our father drink wine, and we will lie with him that we may
              33 raise up seed from our father.                            So they made their father drink
                    wine that very night, and the elder having gone in lay with her
                   father that night, and he knew not when she lay down, nor when
              34 she arose.            And on the next night the elder said to the young-
                    er, Lo ! I lay with our father last night, let us make him drink
                    wine this night also, and do thou go in and lie with him and
              35 let us raise up seed from our father.                                So they made their father
                    drink wine that night also, and the younger went in and lay
                    with her father ; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when
              36 she arose.              Thus the two daughters of Lot conceived by their
              37 father.           And the eldest bore a son and called his name 3Foab,
                    saying From myfather.                        He is the father of the present 3Ioa-
              38 bites.          And the youngest also bore a son and called his name
                    Amman saying, Son of the same as I.                                   He is the father of the
                    present Ammanites.
              XX.           NowAbraham had removed thence into the south country,
                     and made his abode between Kades and Sour, and sojourned

     2 among the Gerarites.     And Abraham said of Sarah his wife,
       She is my sister.    For he was afraid to say, She is my wife,
     3 lest the men of the city should kill him on her account.      And
       Abimelech the king of the Gerarites sent and took Sarah.      And
       God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said, Behold
       thou diest for this woman, whom thou hast taken ; for
     4 she is the man's wife.      Now Abimelech had not touched
       her.  And Abimelech said,        Lord, wilt thou destroy an un-
     5 knowing and righteous nation ? Did he not tell me, She is my
       sister ? And did not she say to me, He is my brother ?       With
     6 a pure heart and innocent hands I have done this.       And God
       said to him in a dream, I know indeed that with a pure heart
       thou hast done this, and out of compassion I withheld thee from
     7 sinning against me.   For this cause I suffered thee not to touch
       her.   Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a pro-
       phet ; and he will pray for thee and thou shalt live.  But if thou
       restore not, be assured that thou and all belonging to thee
     8 shall die.  And Abirnelech arose early next morning and called
       all his servants and related all these things in their hearing.
     9 And all the men were exceedingly terrified.      Then Abimelech
       sent for Abraham and said to him, Why hast thou dealt thus
       with us ? Have we in any respect sinned against thee, that thou
        shouldst bring upon me and upon my kingdom this great sin ?
    10 Thou hast done to me what no one should do.              Moreover
       Abimelech said to Abraham, What didst thou see that thou
    1  shouldst do this ? And Abraham said, I indeed thought, as
       there is no worship of God in this place, they will kill me for
    12 my wife's sake.   And indeed of a truth she is my sister by the
        same father but not of the same mother, so she became my wife.
    13 And when God led me out from my father's house I said to
        her, Thou wilt do me this kindness.     To what place soever we
    14 come say of me, He is my brother.        Then Abimelech took, a
        thousand didrachms and sheep and oxen and men servants
        and maid servants and gave them to Abraham, and restored to
    15 him Sarah his wife.    And Abimelech said to Abraham, Behold
    16 my land is before thee ; dwell wherever it may please thee. And
        to Sarah he said, Behold 1 have given thy brother a thou-
        sand didrachms.    Let these therefore be for thee to adorn thy
        countenance and for all the women with thee.          ^Iake thou

         17 therefore all things hereafter accord with truth.                  Then Abra-
             ham prayed to God ; and God healed Abinielech and his wife
         18 and his maid servants and they Lore children.                   For the Lord
             had shut up every womb in Abimelech's family on the account
             of Sarah the wife of Abraham.
         XXI. Now the Lord visited Sarah as he had said.                    And the Lord
          2 did for Sarah as he had spoken, and she conceived and bare a
             son to Abraham in old age at the set time, of which the Lord
          3 had spoken to him.           And Abraham called the name of his son
          4 who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaak.                         And
             Abraham circumcised Isaak on the eighth day, as God had com-
          5 manded him.          Now Abraham was a hundred years old when
          (3 his son Isaak was born to him.                And Sarah said, The Lord
             hath made laughter for me ; for whoever shall hear will rejoice
          7 with me.       And she said, Who will tell Abraham that Sarah is
          8 suckling a childâ€”that I have born a son in my old age !                      And
             the child grew and was weaned and Abraham made a great en-
          9 tertainment on the day his son Isaak was weaned.                     And when
             Sarah saw the son of Agar the Egyptian who was born to
             Abraham sporting with her son Isaak, she said to Abraham,
         10 Send away this girl and her son ; for the son of this girl shall
         11 not be heir with my son Isaak.              And the thing appeared very
         12 hard in Abraham's view, touching his son.                   But God said to
             Abraham, Let not this respecting thy son and respecting the
             handmaid appear hard in thy view.                Hearken to the voice of
         13 Sarah in whatever she may have said to thee.                   For in Isaak a
             seed shall be called for thee.         Nevertheless I will make the son
         14 of this handmaid a great nation, because he is thy seed.                       So
             Abraham arose early the next morning and took loaves and a
              skin full of water, and when he had put them on her shoulder
              he gave the boy to Agar and sent her away.               And she departing
         15 lost her way between the wilderness and Well of the Oath ; And
              the water in the skin being spent she laid the boy under the
              first pine tree and going away sat down over against him at the
         16 distance ofabout a bow shot.            For she said, I cannot behold the
             death of my son.        So she sat over against him and the lad wept
         17 with a loud voice.          And God heard the voice of the lad from
              the place where he was.         And an angel of God called to Agar
              out of heaven and said, What is the matter, Agar ? Fear not.
      XXII.                GENESIS.
   Ch.
      For God hath heard the voice of the lad from the place where
   18 he is.Arise and take up the boy and support him with thy
   19 hand ; for I will make him a great nation.And God opened
     her eyes and she saw a well of spring water.So she went and
  20 filled the vessel with water and gave the boy drink.And God
     was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and
  21 became a bowman.   Thus he dwelt in the wilderness, and his
     mother took for him a wife from Pharan of Egypt.
  22    Now it happened at that time that Abimelech, accompanied
     with Ochozath his chamberlain and Phichol the general of his
  23 army, spoke to Abraham saying, God is with thee in all that
     thou dost. Now therefore swear to me by God, that thou wilt
     not injure me nor my seed nor my name ; but that according
     to the kindness with which I have treated thee, thou wilt deal
  24 with me and this land in which thou hast sojourned. And Abra-
  25 ham said, I swear. Then Abraham expostulated with Abime-
     lech touching the wells of water which the servants of Abime-
   26 lech had taken.And Abimelech said to him, I did not know
     that any one had done this to thee.Thou didst not tell me, nor
   27 did I hear of it till this day.Then Abraham took sheep and
      oxen and gave them to Abimelech ; and they both made a co-
   28 venant. Now Abraham had set seven ewe lambs by them-
   29 selves ; And Abimelech said to Abraham, What are these se-
   30 ven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves ? Upon which
      Abraham said, These seven ewe lambs thou wilt take of me
      that they may be a witness for me, that I digged this well.
   31 For this cause he called the name of that place, Well of the
      Oath, because both of them swore there and made a covenant
   32 at Well of the Oath.Then arose Abimelech and Ochozath his
      chamberlain and Phichol the general of his army and returned
   33 to the land of the Philistines ; and Abraham planted a field at
      Well of the Oath and there invoked the name of the Lord, the
   34 everlasting God.And Abraham sojourned many days in the
      land of the Philistines.
   XXII.    And it came to pass after these things that God tried
      Abraham and said to him, Abraham ! xVbraham ! And he said,
    2 Here I am. And he said, Take thy son, thy dear son whom thou
      hast lovedâ€”Isaak; and go to the hilly country and offer him up
      there for a whole homage offering on one of the hills which I
           XXII.                 GENESIS.
       Ch.
        3 will point out to thee.So Abraham arose in the morning and
          saddled his ass and took with him two servants and his son
          Isaak : and having split wood for the whole homage offering he
          set out on the journey and came to the place which God
        4 told him on the third day.Now when Abraham raised his eyes
        5 and saw the place at a distance he said to his servants, Stay
          here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder, and when
        6 we have worshipped we will return to you.    Then Abraham
          took the wood of the whole homage offering and laid it on his
          son Isaak ; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife, and
        7 they both proceeded on together. And Isaak said to his father
          Abraham, Father.   And he said, What is the matter, son ?
          And Isaak said, Here is the fire and the wood ; where is the
        8 sheep for a whole homage offering ? And Abraham said, My
          son ! God will provide for himself a sheep for a whole homage
        9 offering. So they both proceeded on together and came to the
          place which God told him.  And Abraham built there the altar,
          and placed thereon the wood ; and having bound his son Isaak
       10 he laid him on the altar above the wood. And when Abraham
           stretched forth his hand to take hold of the knife to slay his
       11 son, the angel of the Lord called to him out of heaven and said,
       12 Abraham ! Abraham ! And he said, Here I am.     And he said,
          Lay not thy hand on the lad, nor do any thing to him ; for now
          I know that thou fearest God and on my account hast not spared
       13 thy darling son. Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and
          lo ! a ram caught by the horns in a sabek bush.And Abraham
          went and took the ram and offered him up for an homage offer-
       14 ing instead of his son Isaak.And Abraham called the name of
          that place, The Lord hath seen, that at this day they might
       15 say, On this mountain, The Lord was seen.    Then the angel
       16 of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven,
       17 saying, By myself I have sworn, saith the Lord, Because
          thou hast done this, and for my sake hast not spared thy beloved
          son ; with blessings I will indeed bless thee ; and I will multi-
          ply thy seed abundantly as the stars of heaven and as the sand
          on the sea shore : and thy seed shall inherit the cities of their
       18 adversaries ; and by the seed of thee all the nations of the earth
          shall be blessed, because thou hast hearkened to my voice.
       19 Then Abraham returned to his servants and they arose and
   Ch. XXIII.                      GENESIS.
       came together to Well of the Oath, for Abraham lived at Well
   20 of the Oath.     And after these things it was told Abraham say-
       ing, With regard to Melcha, behold she also hath born sons to
   21 thy brother Nachor, Ouz the first born, and Banx his brother,
   22 and Hamnel, the father of the Syrians, and Chazad and Azau,
   23 and Phaldes and Jeldaph and Bathuel ; and Bathnel begot Ke-
       bekka.    These were the eight sons, whom Melcha bore to Na-
   24 chor the brother of Abraham.         And his concnbine whose name
       was Eeuma bore also Tabek and Gaani and Tochos and Mo-
       cha.
   XXIII.         Now the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty seven
    2 years.   And Sarah died in the city Arbok, which is in the vale,
       the same is Chebron in the land of Chanaan.       AndAbraham went
    3 to mourn for Sarah and to make lamentation.             And Abraham
       arose from before his dead and spoke to the children of Chet,
    4 saying, I am a stranger and sojourner among you, give me
       therefore the possession of a burying place among you, that I
    5 may bury my dead from before me.           And the children of Chet
       answered and said to Abraham, Nay, Sir, rather hearken to us.
    6 Thou art a king from God among us.              In the choice of our
       tombs bury thy dead ; for there is none of us who will deny
    7 thee his tomb to bury there thy dead.           Then Abraham stand-
       ing up made obeisance to the people of the landâ€”the children
    8 of Chet.     And Abraham spoke to them saying, If it be your
       wish that I should bury this my dead out of my sight, hearken
    9 to me and speak for me to Ephron the son of Saar.          And let him
       give me the double cave which belongeth to himâ€”that which
       is in a part of his field. Let him give it to me for the full value
   10 of it, among you, for a possession of a burying place.             Now
       Ephron was sitting among the children of Chet ; And Ephron
       the Chettite answered Abraham and said in the hearing of the
       children of Chet and of all coming into the city, Attend, Sir,
   11 and hearken to me.       The field and the cave which is in it I give
       thee.   In the presence of my fellow citizens I have given them
   12 to thee.    Bury thy dead.     And when Abraham had made obei-
       sance before all the people of the land, he said to Ephron in the
   13 hearing of all the people of the land, As thou art here before
       me, hearken to me.      Take of me in silver the value of the field
   14 and I will bury my dead there.         Whereupon Ephron answered
           VOL. I.                      E
             XXIV.                    GENESIS.
        Oh.
        15 Abraham, saying, Nay, Sir, I have indeed heard that the land
            is worth four hundred didrachms of silver ; but what can that
        16 be between me and thee ? But bury thou thy dead.         And Abra-
            ham hearkened to Ephron ; and Abraham paid down to Ephron
            the money which he mentioned in the hearing of the children
            of Chet, four hundred didrachms of silver current among mer-
        17 chants.   So the field of Ephron including the double cave which
            is situate before Mambre, the field and the cave in it and all the
            wood in the field and all within the bounds thereof round about
        18 were conveyed to Abraham for a possession in the presence of
        19 the children of Chet and of all who entered the city.     After this
            Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the double cave of the field
            which is over against Mambre (the same is Chebron in the land
        20 of Chanaan.)     And the property of the field and the cave in it
            was confirmed to Abraham for a possession of a burying place
            by the children of Chet.
        XXIV. Now Abraham was old and far advanced in years, and the
         2 Lord had blessed him in all things.      And Abraham said to his
            servant, the oldest of his family and who was ruler over all
         3 that he had, Put thy hand under my thigh, and let me cause
            thee to swear by the Lord the God of heaven and the God of
            earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son Isaak, of the
         4 daughters of the Chananites among whom I dwell ; but that
            thou wilt go to the land where I was born, and to my tribe and
         5 take thence a wife for my son Isaak.       And the servant said to
            him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to come with me
         6 to this land ; shall I take back thy son to the land from which
            thou earnest ?   Whereupon Abraham said to him, Beware that
         7 thou take not back my son thither.      The Lord, the God of hea-
            ven and the God of earth, who took me from my father's house
            and from the land of my nativity ; who spoke to me, and who
            sware to me saying, " To thee I will give this land and to thy
            seed ; " he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take
         8 thence a wife for my son.      But if the woman will not come
            with thee into this land, thou shalt be absolved from this my oath,
         9 save that thou must not take my son back thither.          Then the
            servant put his hand under his master Abraham's thigh, and
        10 swore to him respecting this matter.      And the servant took ten
            camels of the camels of his master ; and of all the goods of his
    Ch. XXIV.                  GENESIS.
        master which were in his charge, and arose and went to Me-
    11 sopotainia to the city of Nachor.  And he made his camels lie
        down without the city, by the well of water, in the evening,
    12 when the women come out to draw water ; and said,        Lord
       the God of my master Abraham, prosper the way before me
    13 this day ; and shew thy kindness to my master Abraham.     Be-
       hold I stand by this well of water and the daughters of the in-
    14 habitants of the city will come out to draw water. Now let the
       virgin to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher that I may
       drink ; and who shall say, Drink thou, and I will give water al-
       so to thy camels till they have all done drinking ; let her be
       the woman whom thou hast provided for thy servant Isaak.
       And by this I shall know that thou hast dealt mercifully with
    15 my master Abraham.     And before he had finished this mental
       speech, lo ! Eebekka the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Mel-
       cha, the wife of Nachor, Abraham's brother, came out with
    1G her pitcher on her shoulder.   Now the damsel was of a very
       beautiful countenance and was a virgin.   No man had known
       her.  So when she had gone down to the well and filled her
    17 pitcher and came up, the servant ran to meet her and said, Let
    18 me drink a little water out of thy pitcher.   Upon which she
       said, Drink, my lord, and hastened to let down the pitcher on
    19 her arm and let him drink till he was satisfied.Then she said,
       I will draw water for thy camels also until they shall have all
    20 drunk.   And she hasted and emptied the pitcher into the wa-
       tering trough and ran to the well to draw more and drew water
    21 for all the camels. And the man observed her attentively and
       held his peace, that he might know whether the Lord had
    22 prospered his journey or not.   And when all the camels had
       done drinking, the man took ear rings of gold of about a drachm
       weight, and a pair of bracelets for her hands, the weight of
       which was ten pieces of gold, and he asked her saying, Whose
    23 daughter art thou ? Tell me, Is there room at thy father's house
    24 for us to lodge ? And she said, I am the daughter of Bathuel,
    25 the son of Melcha, whom she bore to Nachor.      Moreover she
       said to him, We have plenty of straw and provender and room
    26 to lodge in.   Then the man being satisfied, worshipped the
       Lord and said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abra-
       ham, who hath not withdrawn his kindness and his truth from
        Cb. XXIV.                 GENESIS.
        27 my master.   The Lord hath indeed given me a prosperous
        28 journey to the house of my master's brother. Upon this the
           damsel ran to her mother's house and told all these things.
        29 Now Kebekka had a brother whose name was Laban.    And La-
        30 ban ran out to the man at the well.When he saw the ear rings
           and bracelets in his sister's hands and heard all the words of
        31 Eebekka his sister, saying, Thus spake the man to me, he went
           to the man who was standing by his camels at the well and said
           to him, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord, why hast thou tar-
       32 ried without?  I have the house ready and a place for the ca-
           mels. So the man went in to the family, and Laban unsaddled
           the camels, and gave straw and provender to the camels, and
           water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with
       33 him, and set bread before them to eat.But the man said I can-
           not eat till I have told my business.And Laban said, speak.
       34 Thereupon the man said, I am Abraham's servant, The Lord
          indeed hath blessed my master exceedingly, so that he is be-
       35 come great.  He hath given him flocks and herds and silver
          and gold, men servants and maid servants, camels and asses.
       36 And Sarah, the wife of my master, hath born one son to my
          master when he was old, and he hath given him all that be-
       37 longed to him.  And my master made me sware saying, Thou
          shalt not take a wife for my son from among the daughters of
       38 the Chananites in whose land I sojourn; but thou shalt go to
          the house of my father and to my tribe and take thence a
       39 wife for my son.  Whereupon I said to my master, Perhaps
       40 the woman will not come with me. And he said to me, The Lord
          God, to whom I have been well pleasing in his sight, will send
          his angel with thee, and make thy journey prosperous, and
          thou shalt take a wife for my son from my tribe and from my
       41 father's house.On this condition only thou shalt be absolved
          from my curse ; when thou hast gone to my tribe, if they will
       42 not give thee, then shalt thou be clear from my oath. Xow,
          when I came to day to the well, I said, Lord the God of my
          master Abraham, if thou prosperest the journey in which I am
       43 now engaged, Behold I have stopped at this well of water, and
          the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw
       44 water, Let the virgin to whom I shall say, Let me drink a little
          water out of thy pitcher ; and who shall say to me, Drink thou,
        XXIV.                 GENESIS.
   Ch.
       and I will draw water for thy camels ; Let her be the wife whom
       the Lord hath provided for his servant Isaak ; and by this I
       shall know that thon hast dealt mercifully with my master
   45 Abraham. Andbefore I had finished this my address in thought,
       straightway Kebekka came with the pitcher on her shoulder
       and went down to the well and drew water, and I said to her,
   46 Let me drink. Upon which she speedily let down the pitcher on
      herarm, and said, Drink thou, and I will water thy camels.  So
      I drank.   And when she had watered the camels, I asked her
   47 saying, Whose daughter art thou ? Tell me. And she said, I am
      the daughter of Bathuel the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bore
      to him.  Then I put the ear rings on her and the bracelets on
   48 her hands, and being well pleased, I worshipped the Lord and
      blessed the Lord the God of my master Abraham, who had
      prospered me in the right way to take the daughter of my
   49 master's brother for his son.Now therefore, if you deal kindly
      and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me ; that I may
   50 turn either to the right or left.In reply to which, Laban and
      Bathuel said, This matter hath proceeded from the Lord.   We
   51 cannot gainsay thee, be it good or bad.   Behold Rebekka is
      before thee. Take her and go and let her be the wife of thy
   52 master's son, as the Lord hath spoken.  And when Abraham's
      servant heard these words, he worshipped the Lord on the
   58 ground.   Then the servant brought out jewels of silver and gold
      and raiment and gave them to Bebekka, and made presents to
   54 her brother and to her mother.    And when he and the men
      who were with him had eaten and drank, they went to rest.
      And he arose early next morning and said, Dismiss me that
   55 I may return to my master.   But her brother and her mother
      said, Let the damsel stay with us about ten days and then she
   56 shall go. And he said to them, Do not detain me, seeing the
      Lord hath prospered my journey as far as it respecteth me.
   57 Send me away that I may go back to my master.     Whereupon
   58 they said, Let us call our child and ask what she saith.   So
      they called Bebekka and said to her, Wilt thou go with this
   59 man?    And she said, I will go.  Then they sent away their
      sister Bebekka and what belonged to her, and the servant of
   GO Abraham and his attendants.    And they blessed Bebekka and
      said to her, Thou art our sister. Mayest thou become thou-
       Ch. XXV.              GENESIS.
          sands of myriads and may thy seed inherit the cities of their
       61 enemies.Then arose Bebekka and her maids, and mounting
          the camels they went with the man.And the servant took
          Bebekka and departed.
       62   Now Isaak had travelled through the wilderness to the well
       63 of Vision, and dwelt in the south country.And in the even-
          ing Isaak went out into the plain to meditate ; and raising his
       64 eyes he saw camels coming.Bebekka also having raised her
       65 eyes, saw Isaak and alighted from her camel.She had said to
         the servant, What man is that coming in the plain to meet us ?
         And the servant said, It is my master.Whereupon she took
       66 her veil and covered herself.And the servant told Isaak all
         that he had done.And Isaak went to his mother's house and
         took Bebekka, and she became his wife, and he loved her.
         And Isaak was comforted for the loss of his mother Sarah.
       XXV.    Now Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was
        2 Chettura and she bore to him Zembran and Jesan and Madal
        3 and Madiam and Jesbok and Soie.And Jesan begat Saba
         and Dedan. And the children of Declan were Assurieim and
        4 Latusieim and Laomeim.And the children of Madiam were
        5 Gephar and Apheir and Enoch and Abeida and Eldaga.All
         these were children of Chettura.But Abraham gave to his son
        6 Isaak all his possessions, and to the children of his concubines
         Abraham gave gifts and sent them, while he was yet living,
         towards the east, into the eastern country from his son Isaak.
        7 Now these were the years of the days of Abraham's life which
        8 he lived, one hundred and seventy five years.And Abraham
          declining died in a good old age, an old man and full of days and
        9 he was added to his people.And his sons Isaak and Ismael
          buried him in the double cave in the field of Ephron the son
       10 of Saar the Chettite, which is over against Marnbreâ€”in the field
          and the cave which Abraham bought of the children of Chet,
          there they buried Abraham with Sarah his wife.And after
       11 the death of Abraham God blessed his son Isaak; and Isaak
          dwelt at the well of Vision.
       12   Now these are the o-enerations of Abraham's son Ismael
       13 whom Agar the Egyptian, Sarah's maid, bore to Abraham ; and
          these are the names of the children of Ismael according to the
       14 names of his families.The first born of Ismael was Nabaioth,
                                                                                                                                 ;
     Ch. XXV.                                            GENESIS.
     15 then Kedar and Nabdael and Massani and Masrua and
           Duma and Masse and Choddan and Thaiman and Jetur and
     16 Naphes and Kednia.                             These are the children of Ismael and
           these are their names in their tents and in their habitations
     17 twelve chiefs of their respective nations.                                          And these were the
           years of the life of Ismael, one hundred and thirty seven years,
     18 and he declining died and was added to his race.                                                    Now he in-
           habited the country from Evilat to Sour which is in front of
           Egypt,all the way to the Assyrians.                                   In front of all his brethren
           was his habitation.
     19          And these are the generations of Isaak the son of Abraham.
    20           Abraham begot Isaak.                          And Isaak was forty years old when
           he took to wife Eebekka the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian
    21 of Syro Mesopotamia the sister of Laban the Syrian.                                                     And Isaak
           intreated the Lord for Eebekka his wife because she was bar-
    22 ren, and the Lord hearkened to him ; And Eebekka his wife
           conceived and the children struggled within her and she said ;
           If it is to be so with me, what doth this portend ? So she went to
    23 inquire of the Lord.                         And the Lord said to her, Two nations are
           in thy womb and two peoples shall be separated from thy belly,
           and the one people will excel the other and the elder shall
    24 serve the younger.                        So when her days to be delivered were ful-
    25 filled there were twins in her womb.                                        And the first born came
           forth red all over hairy like a hide and she called his name
    26 Esau ; and after that came forth his brother and his hand had
    27 hold of Esau's heel, and she called his name Jacob.                                                     Now Isaak
           was sixty years old when Eebekka bore them.                                                        And when
           they grew up to be young men, Esau was a man skilled in
           hunting and fond of the field ; but Jacob was a man of plain
    28 manners and lived at home.                                    And Isaak loved Esau, because
    29 his game was his food ; But Eebekka loved Jacob.                                                        Now when
    30 Jacob was boiling pottage Esau came from the field fainty.                                                          And
           Esausaid to Jacob, Let me taste some of that red pottage, for I am
    31 fainty.             For this cause his name was called Edom.                                            And Jacob
           said to Esau, give me this day in exchange thy rights of primo-
    32 geniture.               And Esau said, Lo ! I am going to die, what then are
    33 these rights of primogeniture to me ?                                          And Jacob said to him,
           Swear now to me.                       So he swore to him.                            Thus were Esau's
    34 rights of primogeniture transferred to Jacob.                                               Then Jacob gave
         Ch. XXVI.                   GENESIS.
            Esau bread and lentil pottage. And when lie had eaten and
            drunk he arose and went away.       Thus did Esau undervalue
            the rights of primogeniture.
         XXVI. Now there had been a famine in the land besides the
            former famine which happened in the time of Abraham.       And
            Isaak went to Abimelech the king of the Philistines, to Gerar.
          2 For the Lord had appeared to him and said, Go not down into
         3 Egypt, but dwell in the land which I will tell thee.     Sojourn
            in this land and I will be with thee and bless thee : for to thee
            and to thy seed I will give all this land. And I will establish
            my oath which I sware to thy father Abraham and multiply
          4 thy seed like the stars of heaven. And to thy seed I will give
          5 all this land ; and by thy seed all the nations of the earth shall
            be blessed ; because Abraham thy father hearkened to my
            voice and kept my ordinances and my commandments and my
         6 rules of rectitude and my rites.     And while Isaak dwelt at
            Gerar the men of the place made inquiry respecting his wife
         7 Eebekka; and he said, She is my sister, for he was afraid to say,
            She is my wife, lest peradventure the men of the place should kill
         8 him for Kebekka's sake, for she was of a very beautiful counte-
            nance.  However he continued there a long time ; for Abimelech
            king of the Gerarites happening to look through a window saw
         9 Isaak dallying with Rebekka his wife.     Whereupon Abimelech
            called Isaak and said to him certainly she is thy wife. Why then
            didst thou say, She is my sister?  And Isaak said to him, Be-
        10 cause I thought I might perhaps die for her.     And Abimelech
            said to him, Why hast thou dealt thus with us ? In a little while
            some person of my family might have lain with thy wife, and
            thou wouldst have brought guilt upon us through ignorance.
        11 Then Abimelech gave a strict charge to all his people saying,
            Whoever toucheth this man or his wife shall be liable to death.
        12 And Isaak sowed in that land and got that year an hundred
        13 fold of barley.   And the Lord blessed him and the man was
            exalted and prospered more and more till he became exceed-
        14 ing great.  And he had flocks and herds of cattle and many
        15 fields under cultivation.  And the Philistines envied him ; and
            all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the time
            of his father, the Philistines stopped up and filled them with
        16 earth.  And Abimelech said to Isaak, Depart from us, for thou
   Ch. XXVI.                      GENESIS.
   17 art become far mightier than we.         Upon this Isaak departed
       thence and took up his abode in the valley of Gerar and dwelt
   18 there.   And Isaak digged again the wells of water, which the
       servants of his father Abraham had digged and which the Phi-
       listines had stopped up, after the death of his father Abraham.
       And he called them by the same names, by which his father
   19 had named them.        Isaak's servants also digged in the valley of
   20 Gerar, and found there a well of spring water.         But the shep-
       herds of the Gerarites contended with Isaak's shepherds, say-
       ing the water was theirs.    So he called the name of that well In-
   21 justice : because they did him injustice.          Then he removed
       thence and digged another well ; and about this also they con-
   22 tended; so he called its name Enmity.         And he removed thence
       and digged another well ; and about this they did not contend ; So
       he called the name of it, Boom-enough; saying, For now the Lord
       hath made room for us, though he hath increased us in the land.
   23      And he went up thence to Well of the Oath ; and the Lord
   24 appeared to him that night and said, I am the God of thy father
       Abraham; Fear not ; for I am with thee ; and I will bless thee
   25 and multiply thy seed for the sake of thy father Abraham.            So
       he built there an altar and invoked the name of the Lord and
   2(j fixed his tent there.   And while the servants of Isaak were dig-
       ging a well there in the valley of Gerar, Abimelech came to
       him from Gerar, accompanied with Ochozath his chamberlain
    27 and Phichol the general of his army.        And Isaak said to them,
       Why are you come to me, seeing you have hated me and sent
   28 me away from you ? And they said, We saw plainly that the
       Lord is with thee ; therefore we said, Let there be an oath be-
    29 tween us and thee ; and we will make a covenant with thee that
       thou wilt not do us an injury, as we have not hated thee but
       used thee well and sent thee away in peace, and thou art now
    30 blessed of the Lord.    Then he made an entertainment for them
    31 and they ate and drank.        And early next morning they arose
       and swore one to the other.        And Isaak dismissed them and
    32 they departed from him in peace.       And it happenedthat on that
        very day the servants of Isaak came and told him of the well
        which they had been digging and said, We have found water.
    33 So he called it, Oath.    For this cause they call the name of the
       city, Well of Oath, even at this day.

      Ch.
      34    Xow when Esau was forty years old lie took to wife Judith,
         the daughter of Beoch the Chettite, and Baseroath the daughter
         of Elon the Chettite, and they were at strife with Isaak and
         Rebekka.
      XXVII. And after Isaak grew old, when his eyes were so dim-
         med that he could not see he called Esau his eldest son and said
       2 to him.  My Son.  And he said here I am.Andhe said, Behold
         I am grown old and do not know the day of my dissolution ;
       3 now therefore take thy armsâ€”the quiver and the bow ; and go
       4 out into the field and hunt game for me and make me savory
         meat such as I love and bring it to me, that I may eat ; that
       5 my soul may bless thee before I die.  Xow Kebekka heard
          Isaak speaking to his son Esau.So when Esau was gone to
       6 the field to hunt game for his father, Rebekka said to Jacob
         her younger son. Lo ! I heard thy father speaking to thy bro-
       7 ther Esau saying, Bring me game and make me savory meat
         that I may eat and bless thee in the presence of the Lord be-
       8 fore I die. Now therefore, my son, hearken to me as I com-
       9 mand thee, and go to the flock and fetch me thence two kids
         tender and good, and I will make them savory meat for thy fa-
      10 ther such as he loveth and thou shalt carry it to thy father that
      11 he may eat ; that thy father may bless thee before he die. And
          Jacob said to his mother Rebekka, My brother Esau is a
       12 hairy man and I am a smooth man.Perhaps my fathermay feel
          me, and I shall be before him as a deceiver, so I shall bring
       13 upon myself a curse and not a blessing.And his mother said
          to him, Upon me, my son, be thy curse.Only hearken to my
       14 voice ; and go and bring me them.So he went and took and
          brought them to his mother ; and his mother made savory meat
       15 such as his father loved.And Rebekka took the robe of Esau
          her eldest son, the robe of dignity which was with her in the
       16 house and put it on her younger son Jacob.And she put the
       17 skins of the kids on his arms and the naked parts of his neck ;
       18 and gave the savory meat and cakes which she had baked, into
          the hands of her son Jacob ; and he took them to his father and
       19 said, Father ! And he said, Here I am.Who art thou, my son ?
          And Jacob said to his father.I am Esau, thy first born. I have
       20 done as thou badest me.Arise, sit up, and eat of my game that
          thy soul may bless me.And Isaak said to his son, What is this,
    Ch. XXVII.                    GENESIS.
    21 myson, which thou hast found so quickly ? And he said, It is what
       the Lord thy God presented to my view.       And Isaak said to Ja-
       cob, Come near my son and let me feel thee, whether thou be
    22 my son Esau or not.    And Jacob went near to his father Isaak.
       And when he had felt him he said, The voice indeed is the voice
    23 of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.       So he did not
       discover him, because his hands were hairy like the hands of his
    2-i brother Esau, when he blessed him.      Then he said.    Art thou
    25 my son Esau? And he said, I am. And he said, Bring it near to
       me and I will eat of thy game, my son, that my soul may bless
       thee.   So he brought it near to him and he ate.   Andhebrought
    26 wine and he drank.      And Isaak his father said to him, Come
    27 near me my son and kiss me.        And when he came near and
       kissed him ; he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed
       him and said, Behold the fragrance of my son is like the fra-
    28 grance of a full field which the Lord hath blessed.       Therefore
       God give thee from the dew of heaven and from the fatness of
       the land plenty of corn and wine.    May nations serve thee ; and
    29 princes bow down to thee.     Be thou lord of thy brother.     And
       let the children of thy father pay thee homage.          Cursed be
       he who curseth thee ; and let him who blesseth thee be bles-
       sed.
    30     Now after Isaak had finished blessing his son Jacob, when
       Jacob had but just withdrawn from the presence of his father
    31 Isaak, Esau his brother came from the chace.          He also had
       made savory meat and he brought it to his father and said to
       him, Arise my father and eat thy son's venison, that thy soul
    32 may bless me.     And Isaak his father said to him, Who art
    33 thou? And he said I am thy son, thy first born Esau.          Then
       was Isaak absorpt in great amazement and said, Who then is
       he who hath hunted game and brought it to me, and I have
       eaten of all before thou earnest and have blessed him, and he
    34 will be blessed.  And when Esau heard the words of his father
       Isaak he cried with a loud and very bitter cry and said, Bless,
    35 I beseech thee, me also,      Father.    And he said to him, Thy
       brother hath come deceitfully and taken thy blessing.          And
    36 Esau said, His name is rightly called Jacob ; for lo ! he hath now
       supplanted me a second time.      He took from me my rights of
   37 primogeniture; and now he hath taken my blessing.              Then
                 Ch. XXVIII.                                          GENESIS.
                       Esau said to his father, Hast thou not,                                                 father, reserved a
                       blessing for me? And Isaak in reply said to Esau, Seeing I
                       have made him thy lord and made all his brethren his servants
                       and have also supported him with corn and wine, what can I
                 38 do for thee, my son ? And Esau said to his father, Hast thou
                       but one blessing, father? Bless, I beseech thee, me also,
                       father.         And Isaak being deeply affected, Esau raised his voice
                39 and wept.                 And Isaak his father answered and said to him, Be-
                       hold thy dwelling shall border on the fatness of the earth and
                       on the dew of heaven from above.                                         By thy sword thou shalt
                40 live and thou shalt serve thy brother.                                          But the time will come
                       when thou mayst shake off and loose his yoke from thy neck.
                41           So Esau harboured a rooted hatred against Jacob on ac-
                       count of the blessing with which his father had blessed him.
                       And in this agitation of his mind Esau said,                                            !  that the days of
                       mourning for my father were come that I may kill my brother
                42 Jacob.              And when the words of Esau her eldest son were told
                       to Rebekka she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him,
                43 Behold thy brother Esau threateneth to kill thee.                                                       Now there-
                       fore, my son, hearken to my voice and arise and flee to Meso-
                44 potamia to my brother Laban at Charran, and dwell with him
                       for some time till the fury and the anger of thy brother turn
                45 away from thee, and until he forget what thou hast done to
                       him, then I will send for thee from that place.                                             Perhaps I may
                46 be bereaved of you both in one day.                                              Then Bebekka said to
                       Isaak, I am weary of my life on account of the daughters of
                       the children of Chet.                       If Jacob should take a wife of the daugh-
                 XXVIII. ters of this land what would life be to me ? Upon this
                       Isaak called Jacob to him and blessed him and charged him
                       saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of the Cha-
                   2 nanites.             Arise and go to Mesopotamia and to the house of
                       Bathuel thy mother's father, and take thence a wife for thyself
                   3 of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.                                                    And may my
                       God bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee, that
                   4 thou mayst become a multitude of nations.                                                 And may he give
                       thee the blessing of my father Abraham, to thee and thy seed
                       after thee, to inherit this land of thy sojourning, which God
                   5 gave to Abraham.                        So Isaak sent away Jacob and he went to
                       Mesopotamia to Laban the son of Bathuel the Syrian the bro-
                       ther of Bebekka who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
        XXVIII.                GENESIS.
    Ch.
     6     When Esau saw that Isaak had blessed Jacob and sent him
       to Syro Mesopotamia to take there a wife for himself, and that
       when he blessed him he charged him saying, Thou shalt not
     7 take a wife of the daughters of the Chananites ; and that Jacob
       hearkened to his father and mother and was gone to Syrian
     8 Mesopotamia, Esau seeing that the daughters of the Chananites
     9 were displeasing in the sight of his father Isaak, went to Is-
       mael and in addition to his other wives took to wife Maeleth
       the daughter of Ismael, Abraham's son, the sister of Xabaioth.
    10     Xow when Jacob set out from Well of the Oath, and was
    11 proceeding on his journey to Charran he came to a place and
       went to rest there, for the sun was setting.Having taken one
       of the stones of the place and put it at his head he composed
    12 himself to rest in that place and dreamed ; and lo ! a ladder set
       on the earth, the top of which reached up to heaven and the an-
    13 gels of God were ascending and descending on it.      And the
       Lord leaned over it and said, I am the God of Abraham thy
       father and the God of Isaak.   Fear not.   To thee and to thy
    14 seed I will give the land in which thou art sleeping.And thy
       seed shall be as the dust of the earth and shall spread abroad
       to the west and the south, and the north and the east. And by
       thee all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed, namely by the
    15 seed of thee. And lo ! I am with thee watching; over thee in all
       the way thou goest and I will bring thee back to this land : for
       I will not leave thee until I have done all that I have spoken
    16 to thee.  And when Jacob awoke from his sleep he said, Surely
    17 the Lord is in this place and I knew it not.  And he was ter-
       rified and said, How awful is this place; This is no other than
    18 the house of God.   And this is the gate of heaven.   So when
       Jacob arose in the morning he took the stone which he had
    19 there put at his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on
       the top of it ; and called the name of that place House of God.
    20 But the first name of this city was Oulamluz.      And Jacob
       made a vow saying, If the Lord God will be with me and watch
       over me in the way in which I am going and give me bread to
    21 eat and raiment to clothe me and bring me back safely to my
    22 father's house, The Lord shall be my God.     And this stone
       which I have set up as a pillar shall be for a house of God.
        And of all that thou mayst give me I will set apart a tenth
       for thee.
        Ch. XXIX.                     GENESIS.
        XXIX.        Then Jacob proceeded on, and went to the land of the
            east to Laban the son of Bathuel, the Syrian, the brother of
          2 Eebekka who was Jacob and Esau's mother.             And looking,
            he saw a well in the plain and there were three flocks of sheep
         3 lying by it ; for out of that well they watered the flocks.     Xow
            there was a great stone on the mouth of the well, and when all
            the flocks were collected there, the shepherds rolled away the
            stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep ; and
            then put the stone again in its place on the mouth of the well.
         4      And Jacob said to them, Brethren, whence are you ? And
         5 they said, We are of Charran.       xlnd he said to them, Do you
         6 know Laban the son of Nachor ?          And they said, We know
            him.   And he said to them, Is he well ? And they said, He is
            well.  And lo yonder is Kachel his daughter ! She was coming
         7 with the sheep.     Then Jacob said to them, There is yet much
            day.   It is not yet time for the cattle to be folded.   Water the
         S flocks and lead them off to feed.   But they said, We cannot, till
            all the shepherds are come together.      Then they will roll the
            stone from the mouth of the well ; and we will water the flocks.
         9 While he was yet speaking with them, lo ! Kachel the daugh-
            ter of Laban came with her father's sheep ; for she tended her
        10 father's flock.   And when Jacob saw Kachel the daughter of
            Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mo-
            ther's brother, Jacob went and rolled the stone from the mouth
            of the well, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's bro-
        il ther.   And Jacob kissed Kachel, and raising his voice he wept
        12 and told Kachel that he was her father's brother ; and that he
            was the son of Kebekka.       Whereupon she ran and told her
        13 father the news.    And when Laban heard the name of Jacob
            his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and having embraced him
            he kissed him, and brought him to his house.         And Jacob re-
        1-1 lated to him all these circumstances.    And Laban said to him,
            Thou art of my bones and of my flesh.        And when Jacob had
        15 been with him a month, Laban said to Jacob, Because thou
           art indeed my brother, thou shalt not serve me for nothing.
        16 Tell me what must be thy wages.       Xow Laban had two daugh-
           ters.  The name of the eldest was Leia ; and the name of the
        17 youngest, Kachel.     Leia's eyes were weak, but Kachel was of
        18 a beautiful countenance, and a very comely person.         And Ja-
   Ch. XXX.                     GENESIS.
       cob loved Rachel, therefore he said, I will serve thee seven
   19 years for Rachel thy youngest daughter.       And Laban said to
       him, It is better for me to give her to thee than to give her to
   20 another man.     Abide with me.     So Jacob served seven years
       for Eachel, and they appeared to him as a few days, because
   21 he loved her.    Then Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife,
   22 for the days are completed, that I may go in unto her.     Where-
       upon Laban collected all the men of the place, and made a
   23 wedding feast.    And in the evening he took his daughter Leia
   24 and brought her to Jacob ; and Jacob went in unto her.        And
       Laban gave his maid Zelpha to his daughter Leia, to be her
   25 handmaid.    And in the morning, when Jacob saw it was Leia,
       he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done to me ? Did I
       not serve thee for Rachel ?  Why then hast thou deceived me ?
   26 And Laban answered, It is not customary with us in this place
   27 to give the younger before the elder.   Finish therefore this one's
       week, and I will give thee the other for the service which thou
   28 mayst perform for me yet other seven years.        And Jacob did
       so. And when he had finished this one's week, Laban gave
   29 him to wife his daughter Rachel ; and Laban gave to his daugh-
   30 ter Rachel, his maid Balla to be her handmaid.         And Jacob
       went in unto Rachel, and loved Rachel more than Leia, and
   31 served him other seven years.      Now when the Lord God saw
       that Leia was slighted, he opened her womb, but Rachel was
   32 barren.   And Leia conceived and bore Jacob a son and called
       his name Reuben; saying, Because the Lord hath seen my
       affliction ; therefore he hath given me a son. Now therefore my
   33 husband will love me.      And she conceived again, and bore to
       Jacob another son, and said, Because the Lord hath heard that
       I am slighted, he hath given me this son also ; so she called his
   34 name Symeon.      And she conceived again and bore a son, and
       said, Now will my husband abide with me for I have born him
    35 three sons; therefore she called his name Levi.     And she con-
       ceived again and bore a son and said, Now for this also I will
       praise the Lord, therefore she called his name Judas.        Then
       she ceased from bearing.
    XXX. Now when Rachel saw that she bore no children to Ja-
       cob, she envied her sister and said to Jacob, Give me children,
     2 else I shall die. And Jacob was angry with Rachel and said to
               XXX.                                 GENESIS.
        Ch.
             her, Am I in God's stead, who hath deprived thee of the fruit
          3 of the womb ? Then Kachel said to Jacobs There is my maid
             Balla       go in unto her, and she shall bring forth on my knees,
                      ;
          4 so I also shall be supplied with children by her means.                                    So she
             <mve him her maid Balla for a wife : and Jacob went in unto
          5 her, And Balla Eachel's maid conceived and bore Jacob a son.
          6 And Bachel said, God hath judged for me and hath heard my
             voice and given me a son : for this cause she called his name
          7 Dan.        And Balla, Eachel's maid conceived again and bore to
          8 Jacob another son.                 Whereupon Kachel said, God helped me
             when I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed.                                      So she
              called his name Nephthaleim.
          9        Now when Leia saw that she had ceased from bearing,
             she also took her maid Zelpha and gave her to Jacob for a wife,
        10 and he went in unto her.                      And Zelpha, Leia's maid conceived
        11 and bore Jacob a son.                    Whereupon Leia said, Good luck.                           So
        12 she called his name Gad.                        And Zelpha, Leia's maid conceiv-
              ed again and bore Jacob another son.                            Upon which Leia said,
        13 Happy am I ; for the women will call me happy.                                     So she called
             his name Aser.
        14         And at the time of the wheat harvest, Keuben went out and
             found in the field mandragore apples and brought them to his
        15 mother Leia.               And Kachel said to her sister Leia, Give me
              some of thy son's mandragores.                           And Leia said, Is it not
              enough for thee that thou hast taken my husband ? Wouldst
              thou take also my son's mandragores ?                          And Kachel said, Shall
              I not have them on this condition ? Let him be with thee to
        16 night for thy son's mandragores.                           So when Jacob was coming
              from the field in the evening, Leia went out to meet him and
              said, Thou must come in to me today ; for I have hired thee
        17 for my son's mandragores.                        And he lay with her that night,
              and God hearkened to Leia and she having conceived bore to
        18 Jacob a fifth son.              xind Leia said, God hath given me my re-
        19 ward for having given my maid to my husband.                                      So she called
              his name Issachar, that is Reward.                       And Leia conceived again
        20 and bore a sixth son to Jacob.                            Whereupon Leia said, God
              hath now endowed me with a good dowry.                                   My husband will
        21 make choice of me, for I have born him six sons.                                     So she cal-
              led his name Zabulon.                 And after this she bore a daughter and
              called her name Deina.
                                                                                                               ;:
       Ch. XXX.                                    GENESIS.
       22         Now God had remembered Kachel and God hearkened to
       23 her and opened her womb.                          And she having conceived bore
            Jacob a son.            Whereupon she said, God hath taken away my
       24 reproach.           So she called his name Joseph, saying, May God
            add to me another son.
       25         And when Kachel had born Joseph, Jacob said to Laban,
            Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my own
       26 country.           Give me up my wives and my children for whom I
            have served thee, that I may go away : for thou knowest the
       27 service which I have done thee.                            Upon which Laban said to
             him, If I have found favour in thy sight, I would avert this evil
       28 for God hath blessed me by thy coming.                                State to me thy wa-
       29 ges and I will give it.                    And Jacob said, Thou knowest what
             service I have done thee, and how many cattle belonging to
       30 thee are now with me.                      Thy stock was small before I came
             but it is increased to a multitude, and the Lord hath blessed
             thee by my attendance.                    Now then, when shall I provide a
       31 house for myself.                And Laban said, What shall I give thee ?
             To which Jacob replied, Thou shalt not give me any thing.
             If thou wilt do this for me, I will again feed thy flock and
       32 keep watch.             Let all thy flocks this day pass in review and se-
             parate thou from them every grizly sheep among the lambs,
       33 and every one speckled and spotted among the goats.                                            Such
             shall be my hire and my righteousness shall answer for me in
             time to come ; for my wages are apparent to thee.                                   AVhatever
             is   not speckled and spotted among the goats, and grizly
             among the sheep, if found with me, let it be deemed stolen.
        34 xVnd Laban said to him, Let it be according to thy proposal.
        35 And that very day he separated the goats which were speck-
             led and spotted, both male and female, and every one among
             the lambs which was grizly and every one in which there was
             a mixture of white, and delivered them into the hands of his
        36 sons, and set three days journey between them and Jacob.
        37 And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.                                   And Jacob took
             him rods of the styrax and almond and plane-tree and peeled
             off the white bark, and twisting it round the green, the white
        38 which he peeled off appeared speckled.                                 And he placed the
             rods which he had peeled, in the watering troughs, in order
             that, when the flocks came to drink, they might engender at

      Ch.
      39 the rods, while they were drinking, with the rods in view.So
         the flocks engendered at the rods and brought forth cattle
      40 streaked and spotted and ash coloured.And when Jacob had
         separated the lambs and placed before the ewes a spotted
         ram and all that had spots among the lambs, then he kept the
         flocks which were for himself apart by themselves and did
      41 not mix them with the flocks of Laban.  And at the season
         when the sheep were engendering and conceiving, Jacob put
         the rods in the troughs before some, that they might engender
         before the rods ; but before others that had lambed he did not
      42 place them.  Thus the indifferent became Laban's but the
      43 choicest were Jacob's.And the man became very rich and
         had much cattle and herds and men servants and maid ser-
      XXXI.      vants and camels and asses.  And Jacob heard the
         words of Laban's sons saying, Jacob hath taken all that be-
         longed to our father, and with our father's substance he hath
       2 acquired all this glory.And Jacob beheld the countenance of
         Laban, and lo ! it was not towards him as heretofore.
       3    Then the Lord said to Jacob, Keturn to thy father's land
       4 and to thy kindred and I will be with thee.Thereupon Jacob
         sent for Leia and Eachel to the field where the flocks were
       5 and said to them, I see that the countenance of your father is
       6 not towards me as heretofore.Though the God of my father
       7 was with me; and you also know that with all my ability I
         have served your father ; yet your father hath dealt deceitful-
         ly with me, and at the ten lambings hath changed my wages.
       8 But God suffered him not to hurt me.   When he said the
         speckled shall be thy wages, then all the cattle brought forth
         speckled. And when he said, The white shall be thy wages.
       9 Then all the cattle brought forth white.So the Lord hath
      10 taken all the cattle of your father and given them to me.In-
         deed when the flocks engendered I beheld with my eyes in a
         dream, and lo ! the he-goats and the rams, which leaped upon
         the sheep and the goats were ring-streaked, spotted and ash
      11 coloured. Moreover an angel of God said to me in a dream,
      12 Jacob ! And I said, What is the matter.And he said, Lift up
         thy eyes and behold the he-goats and the rams which are leap-
         ing on the sheep and the goats !   They are ring-streaked,
         speckled and ash coloured ; for I have seen what Laban is do-
      Ch. XXXL                 GENESIS.
      13 ing to thee.I am the God who appeared to thee at the place
         of God, where thou didst anoint for me a pillar and where
         thou didst make a vow. Now therefore arise and depart from
         this land and go to the land of thy nativity, and I will be with
      14 thee. In reply to which Kachel and Leia said to him, Have we
      15 anymore a portion or an inheritance in our father's house ?Are
         we not accounted by him as strangers ?For he hath sold us
      16 and spent the money he got for us.Now since all the riches
         and glory which God hath taken from our father shall be ours
         and our children's, do then what God hath commanded thee.
      17 So Jacob arose and put his wives and his children on camels,
      18 and carried off all his substance, and all the goods which he had
         gotten in Mesopotamia, and all that belonged to him, to go to
         his father Isaak in the land of Chanaan.
      19    Xow Laban being gone to sheer his sheep, Rachel stole
      20 her father's idols.And Jacob concealed his design from Laban
      21 the Syrian by not telling him that he was going away. And
         he departed with all that belonged to him and crossed the river
      22 and bent his course to mount Galaad. But on the third day
         news was brought to Laban the Syrian, that Jacob was fled.
      23 Whereupon taking with him his brethren he pursued him se-
      24 ven days journey and overtook him at mount Galaad.But God
         came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night and said to him,
      25 Take care that thou speak not evil to Jacob.Now when Laban
         overtook Jacob, Jacob had pitched his tent on the mount.So
      26 Laban halted his brethren at mount Galaad. And Laban said
         to Jacob, What hast thou done ?  Why didst thou flee away
         secretly, and steal off without my knowledge, and carry away
      27 my daughters as if captivated by the sword ?Hadst thou told
         me I might have sent thee away with joy and musick, with
      28 timbrels and the kithara.But I have not been thought worthy
      29 to kiss my children and my daughters.  Now therefore thou
         hast acted foolishly ; and it is now in my power to punish thee.
         But the God of thy father spoke to me last night saying, Take
      30 care that thou speak not evil to Jacob.Now grant that thou
         hast gone because thou hadst a longing desire to return to thy
         father's house, yet why hast thou stolen my Gods ?
      31     In reply to this Jacob said to Laban, I was afraid ; for I
         thought that thou perhaps wouldst take from me thy daughters
     Ch. XXXI.                 GENESIS.
     32 and all that are mine : but said Jacob, with whomsoever thou
        flndest thy Gods, let him not live.In the presence of our bre-
        thren, examine what there is of thine with me and take it.He
     33 knew of nothing with him.  Now Jacob did not know that his
         wife Eachel had stolen them.So when Laban had gone in and
        searched Leia's tent and found them not ; and from Leia's
         tent had gone and searched the tent of Jacob and in the tent
     34 of the two handmaids but did not find them.Then he went in
        also to Rachel's tent.Now Rachel had taken the idols and put
     35 them in the camel's furniture and sat upon them, and she said
        to her father, Be not offended my lord, I cannot rise before
         thee, for the custom of women is upon me.  So when Laban
     36 had searched the whole tent but did not find the idols, Jacob
         was inflamed with resentment and remonstrated against Laban.
         And Jacob addressing Laban said, What is my crime, and
         what my offence that thou hast pursued me ? And that thou
     37 hast searched all the goods of my house?   What hast thou
         found of all the goods of thy house ?Set it here before thy
         brethren and my brethren and let them judge between us both
     38 These twenty years that I have been with thee, thy sheep and
         thy goats have not cast their young ; nor have I devoured the
     39 rams of thy flock. What was torn by wild beasts I brought not
         to thee. I made up at my own expence the loss of what was
     40 stolen by day or by night. I have borne the sultry heat of the
         day and the frost of the night, and sleep departed from my
     41 eyes.  I have been in thy family these twenty years.I served
         thee fourteen years for thy two daughters ; and six years for thy
         flocks; though thou didst change my wages at the ten lamb-
     42 ings.  Had not the God of my father Abraham and the fear of
         Isaak been with me, thou wouldst now have sent me away
         empty.  God hath seen my affliction and the labour of my
     43 hands, therefore he rebuked thee last night.In reply to this
         Laban said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and
         the children are my children, and the cattle are my cattle.
         Even all that thou seest are mine and my daughters. What
     44 now can I do to them and their children whom they have born ?
         Now therefore come and let us make a covenant, both I and
         thou. And let it be for a memorial between me and thee.And
         he said to him, Behold there is none with us ; God a witness
     Ch. XXXII.                 GENESIS.
     45 between me and thee hath seen.    Then Jacob took a stone and
     46 set it up for a pillar.And Jacob said to his brethren, Collect
        stones.  And when they had collected stones and made a heap,
     47 they eat thereon.  Then Laban said to him, This heap is this
        day a witness between me and thee ; so Laban called it, The
     48 heap of witness ; but Jacob called it Heap ivitness.      And
        Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap and this pillar which I
        have set between me and thee !  This heap witnesseth and this
        pillar witnesseth (for this cause its name was called Heap wit-
     49 nesseth and the sight, which said he, God would see between
        me and thee, because we shall be separated one from the
     50 other) if thou afflict my daughters, if thou take other wives
        besides my daughters, look ! though there be none with us to
     51 see, God is a witness between me and thee.    Moreover Laban
     52 said to Jacob, Behold; this heap is a witness and this pillar
        also, that if I pass not to thee neither shalt thou pass to me be-
     53 yond this heap and this pillar for harm. The God of Abraham
     54 and the God of Xachor judge between us.      And Jacob swore
        bythe Fear of his father Isaak. Then he offered a sacrifice upon
        the mount and invited his brethren and they ate and drank
     ^ and slept on the mount.   And in the morning Laban arose and
     XXXII.     kissed his daughters and blessed them.    And Laban
        departed and went to his place and Jacob proceeded on his
        journey.  And raising his eyes he saw a camp of God pitched
      2 and messengers of God were coming: to meet him.     And when
        Jacob saw them he said, That is a camp of God, So he called
        the name of that place Camps.
      3    Xow Jacob had sent messengers before him to his brother
        Esau, to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom, and had
      4 given them a charge, saying, Thus shall you say to my lord
      5 Esau, Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with La-
        ban and staid till now.  And I have got oxen and asses and
        sheep and men servants and maid servants.    And I have sent
        to give notice to my lord Esau, that thy servant may find fa-
      6 vour in thy sight.  So the messengers returned to Jacob and
        said, We have been to thy brother Esau ; and lo ! he is coming
      7 to meet thee; and four hundred men with him.       Thereupon
        Jacob was greatly terrified and distressed.And he divided the
        people who were with him ami the cattle and the camels and
                                                                                                                               ;

             8 the flocks into two camps.                          And Jacob said, If Esau come to
                 the first camp and smite it, there will be another camp to
             9 escape.          Then Jacob said,                    God of my father Abraham, and
                 the God of my father lsaak, Thou,                                  Lord, who saidst to me,
                 Keturn to the land of thy nativity, and I will deal well with
           10 thee ; let me be satisfied with all the kindness and with all the
                 truth which thou hast shewn to thy servant.                                   For with this staff
                 of mine I crossed the Jordan, but now I am become two
           11 camps.            Deliver me from the hand of my brotherâ€”from the
                 hand of Esau ; for I am afraid of him.                                  Peradventure he may
           12 come and smite me and the mother with the children.                                                       But
                 thou hast said, 1 will deal well with thee and make thy seed
                 like the sand of the sea, which, for multitude cannot be num-
           13 bered.           So he halted there that night and took presents of what
           14 he had brought and sent to his brother Esau two hun-
           15 dred she-goats and twenty he-goats ; two hundred ewes and
                 twenty rams ; thirty milch camels with their thirty colts ; forty
           16 cows and ten bulls ; twenty asses and ten foles.                                           These he de-
                 livered to his servants, each drove by itself, and he said to his
                 servants, Go on before me and make a small distance between
            17 drove and drove.                    And he gave orders to the first saying, If
                 my brother Esau meet thee and ask thee saying, To whom
                 dost thou belong, and whither art thou going ?                                       And whose are
            18 these before thee ? thou shalt say, They belong to thy ser-
                  vant Jacobâ€”presents which he hath sent to my lord Esau.
            19 And lo ! he is behind us.                        This charge he gave to the first, and
                  to the second, and to the third, and to all who went before him
                  after their droves, saying, In this manner speak to Esau when
            20 you meet him.                   Moreover ye shall say, Behold thy servant Ja-
                  cob is coming behind us.                     For he said, I will appease him with
                  these previous gifts, and afterwards I will look him in the face,
                  perhaps he will receive me favourably.
            21          So the presents went on before him ; but he lay that night
            22 in the camp.                And he arose in the night and took his two wives
                  with the two handmaids and his eleven sons and crossed the
            23 ford of Jabok.                  And when he had taken and conducted them
                  over the brook he caused all belonging to him to cross over
             24 and Jacob was left alone.                          And a man wrestled with him till
             25 the murning.                  And when he saw that he could not prevail
     Ch. XXXTTT.               GENESIS.
        against him lie touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hol-
        low of Jacob's thigh became numb, in wrestling with him.
     26 And he said to him, Let me go : for the dawn approached.
     27 But Jacob said I will not let thee go unless thou bless me.And
        he said to him what is thy name ? to which he replied, Jacob.
     28 Thereupon he said to him, Thy name shall no more be Jacob
        only, but Israel also shall be thy name.Since thou hast been
        enabled to prevail with God, therefore with men thou shalt be
     29 mighty.  Then Jacob asked him saying, Tell me thy name.
     30 And he said why dost thou ask my name ?     Then he blessed
        him there.  And Jacob called the name of that place, Face of
        God : for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserv-
     31 ed.  Now the sun was risen when he departed from Face of
     32 Goal : and he limped with his thigh.For this cause even to this
        day the children of Israel do not eat the sinew which is in the
        hollow of the thigh which was numbed ; for he had touch-
        ed the hollow of Jacob's thigh on the sinew and it was numb-
        ed.
     XXXIII.      Now when Jacob looked up and saw with his eyes,
        that lo ! Esau his brother was coming and with him four hun-
      2 dred men ; thereupon Jacob divided his children to Leia, and
        Kachel, and the two maids.   And he put the two maids and
        their children foremost, and Leia and her children next, and
      3 Eachel and Joseph hindmost.    And he himself went before
        them ; and he made a low obeisance to the ground seven times
      4 until he came near to his brother.And Esau ran to meet him
        and embraced him and fell upon his neck and kissed him and
      5 they both wept.  And when Esau looked up and saw the wo-
        men and the children he said, What ! Are these thine ! To
        which Jacob replied, These are the children with which God
      6 hath favoured thy servant. Then the maids and their children
      7 came near and made obeisance ; next Leia and her children
        came near and made obeisance ; and after that Rachel came
        near with Joseph ; and when they had made obeisance he said,
      8 What is the meaning of all those droves which I met ?  And
        Jacob said, That thy servant may find favour in the sight of
      9 thee my lord.   Whereupon Esau said, I have enough, my
     10 brother ; keep thou thine own. But Jacob replied, If I have
        found favour in thy sight, receive these presents at my hands,
            XXXIV.                    GENESIS.
       Ch.
           because I have seen thy face as one would see the face of God ;
       11 and thou wilt oblige me.        Receive these my blessings which
           I have brought thee ; because God hath dealt bountifully with
       12 me, and is all things to me.       So he pressed him and he took
           them.    Then he said, Let us depart and march on straightway.
       13 But Jacob said to him, My lord perceiveth that the children
           are tender, and the sheep and cows with me have just had
           young.    If therefore I over drive them one day, all the cattle
       14. will die.   Let my lord go on before his servant, and I will
           recruit them on the way by a leisurely march as fast as the
       15 young can walk, until I come to my lord at Seir.           Then Esau
           said, Let me leave with thee some of the people who are with
           me.    To which Jacob replied, What need is there ?         It is suffi-
           cient that I have found favour in the sight of thee, my lord.
        16 So Esau set out that day on his return to Seir and Jacob march-
        17 ed on to Booths, and there built houses for himself and booths
           for his cattle, for which cause he called the name of that place
           Booths.
        18     And when Jacob came from Syrian Mesopotamia he went
           to Salem a city of the Sekimites which is in the land of Chanaan,
        19 and encamped before the city, and purchased of Emmor, the
        20 father of Sychem, the part of the field where he had pitched
           his tent for a hundred lambs and he erected there an Altar and
        XXXIV.         invoked the God of Israel.      And Deina the daughter
            of Leia, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to make an ac-
         2 quaintance with the daughters of the neighbours.         And Sychem
            the son of Emmor the Evite, who was the prince of the coun-
            try, saw her and took her and lay with her and humbled her.
         3 And having applied himself to gain the affections of Deina the
            daughter of Jacob, for he loved the virgin, and having spoken
         4 to her according to the wishes of the virgin, Sychem said to
         5 his father Emmor, Get me this young woman for a wife.             Now
            Jacob had heard that the son of Emmor had defiled his daugh-
            ter Deina ; but as his sons were with the cattle in the field
         6 Jacob held his peace till they came.        So Emmor the father of
         7 Sychem went out to Jacob to speak to him ; and Jacob's sons
            came from the plain.     Andwhen the menheard, they were stung
            to the quick ; and it was exceedingly painful to them, that he
            had brought dishonour on Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter,
                                                                    â€”
         XXXIY.                 GENESIS.

     8 and it should not pass so.   And Eminor spoke to them saying,
       My son Sychem hath a passionate fondness for your daughter,
       therefore give her to him for a wife, and unite yourselves to
     9 us by the ties of affinity.  Give us your daughters and take
    10 our daughters for your sons and dwell among us.      Behold the
       land before you is spacious.  Dwell and trade therein and pur-
    11 chase possessions in it. Sychem also said to her father and to
       her brothers, Let me find favour in your sight ; and what-
    12 ever you say we will give.    Make the dower ever so great I
       will Igive whatever you tell me, so you give me this damsel
    13 for a wife. But the sons of Jacob answered Sychem and Em-
    14 mor his father deceitfully.  And because their sister had been
       defiled, Symeon and Levi the brothers of Deina spoke to them
       and said, We cannot do this thing to give our sister to a man
    15 who is uncircumcised ; for that with us is a reproach.  On this
       condition only will we coalesce with you and dwell with you
    16 if you become like us by every male of you being circumcised,
       then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters
    17 for wives, and dwell among you and be as one race.       But if
       you will not hearken to us to be circumcised, we will take
    18 our daughter and depart.    And the proposal pleased Eminor
    19 and Sychem the son of Eminor.       And the young man made
       no delay to carry this into execution, for he was passionately
       fond of Jacob's daughter.
    20     Now he was the most honourable of all his father's family :
       so Emmor and his son Sychem went to the gate of their city
    21 and spoke to the men of their city saying.  These are peaceable
       men; let them dwell with us in the land and use it for the
       purposes of trade.   Behold the land before them is spacious.
       Let us take their daughters for our wives and give them our
    22 daughters.   Only on this condition will these men dwell with
       us so as to be one peopleâ€”that every male among us be cir-
    23 cumcised as they are circumcised.  Will not their cattle and four
    24 footed beasts and all their substance become ours ? Let us only
       be like them in this, and they will dwell with us. Accordingly
       all who went in at the gate of their city hearkened to Emmor
       and his son Sychem and were every male of them, circum-
    25 cised.  And on the third day when they were in pain, the two
       sons of Jacob, Symeon and Levi the brothers of Deina took,
           VOL. I.                       H
                                                                        â€”
       Ch. XXXV.                    GENESIS.
           each his sword and entered the city without danger and slew
       26 every male.    They slew both Emmor and Sychem his son
           with the edge of the sword, and took Deina out of Sychem's
       27 house and went away.     And the sons of Jacob came upon the
           slain and rifled the city in which their sister Deina had been
           defiled ; and took their flocks and their herds and their asses,
           both all that was in the city and all that was in the field, and
           took captive all their servants and all their children and their
           wives and plundered what was in the city and what was in the
       30 houses.    Thereupon Jacob said to Symeon and Levi, You
           have made me an object of hatred so as to be deemed a mor-
           tal enemy to all the inhabitants of the land, both to the Chana-
           nites and the Pherezites.   Now as I am few in number they
           will assemble against me and fall upon me, and I and my
       31 house shall be utterly destroyed.     And they said, But shall
           they treat our sister like a harlot ?
       XXXV.        Then God said to Jacob, arise and go to the place
           Bethel and dwell there.   And erect there an altar to the God
           who appeared to thee, when thou wast fleeing from the face
        2 of thy brother Esau.   Thereupon Jacob said to his family and
           to all who were with him, Put away the strange gods which
           are with you and purify yourselves and change your gar-
        3 ments ; and let us arise and go to Bethel and build there an
           altar to the God who hearkened to me in a day of distress
           who was with me and preserved me in the way in which I
        4 went.   So they gave Jacob the strange gods, which were in
           their hands and the ear rings which were in their ears ; and
          Jacob hid them in the pine grove, which was in the country
         5 of the Sekimites and destroyed them even to this day.      Then
           Israel removed from the country of the Sekimites; and a
           terror of God was on all the cities around them, so that they
         6 did not pursue the children of Israel.  And when Jacob came
           to Louza which is in the land of Chanaan, the same is Baithel,
         7 he and all the people who were with him, he built there an al-
           tar, and called the name of the place Baithel ; because God
           appeared to him there, when he was fleeing from the face of
         8 his brother Esau.   And Debbora the nurse of Eebekka died
           and was buried under the Oak below Baithel.     So Jacob called
         9 its name Oak of mourning.    And God appeared to Jacob again
                        XXXV.                                                          GENESIS.
             Ch.
                     at Louza after he came from Syrian Mesopotamia, and God
            10 blessed him and God said to him, Thy name shall no more
                     be called Jacob ; but Israel shall be thy name.                                                                                          So he called
            11 his name Israel.                                         And God said to him, I am thy God.                                                                              In-

            12 of nations; and kings shall spring from thy loins.                                                                                                       And this
                     land, which I gave to Abraham and Isaak, I have given to
                     thee.              To thee it shall belong : and to thy seed after thee I
            13 will give this land.                                            And when God ascended from himâ€”from
            14 the place where he had spoken with him, Jacob set up a pil-
                     larâ€”a stone pillar in the place where God spoke to him ; and
            15 he made a libation thereon and poured oil upon it.                                                                                                         And Ja-
                     cob called the name of the place where God spoke with him,
                     Baithel.
            16                And Jacob removed from Baithel and pitched his tent
                â€¢    beyond the tower of Gader.                                                       And when he was near Chabratha
                     on the way to Ephratha, Rachel was taken in labour and had
            17 a hard delivery.                                         And when she was in the sharp pangs of
                     child birth, the midwife said to her, Courage ; for this also is
            18 a son for thee.                                     And just as she was departing (for she died)
                    she called his name Sun of my sorrow ; but his father called
           19 his name Benjamin.                                                 And Rachel died and was buried in the
           20 race ground of Ephratha, which is Bethlehem.                                                                                                       And Jacob
                    erected a pillar over her grave.                                                                  The same is the pillar of
           21 Rachel's grave even to this day.                                                                        And while Israel dwelt in
                    that land, Reuben went and lay with Balla the concubine of
                    his father Jacob, and Israel heard of it, and it appeared evil in
                    his sight.
           22                Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.                                                                               The sons of Leia,
                    Reuben, Jacob's first born, Symeon, Levi, Judas, Issachar,
                    Zabulon : and the sons of Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin; and
                    the sons of Balla, Rachel's handmaid, Dan and Nephthaleim :
                    and the sons of Zelpha, Leia's handmaid, Gad and Aser.
           26 These were tthe sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Sy-
                    rian Mesopotamia.                                      Then Jacob went to his father Isaak, to
                    Mambre, a city of the plain, the same is Chebron in the land
           28 of Chanaan, where Abraham and Isaak had sojourned.                                                                                                                   Now
                    the days which Isaak lived were one hundred and eighty
                    years.               And Isaak fainting away died and was added to his
                                                                                                                             ;
           Ch. XXXVI.                                      GENESIS.
                 race being an old man and full of days : and his sons Esau
                 and Jacob buried him.
           XXXVI.                 Now these are the families of Esau, the same is
                Edom. Esau took to himself wives from the daughters of the
                 Chananitesâ€”Ada the daughter of Ailom the Chettite ; and
                 Olibema the daughter of Ana, the son of Sebegon the Evite
            3 and Basemath, Ismael's daughter, the sister of Nabaioth.                                                 And
                Ada bore him Eliphas; and Basemath bore Baguel; and Oli-
            5 bema bore Jeous and Jeglom and Kore.                                         These were the sons
                of Esau who were born to him in the land of Chanaan.
            6 And Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and
                all the persons belonging to his family, and all his substance,
                and all his cattle, and all that he possessed, and all that he had
                gotten in the land of Chanaan, and went out from the land of
            7 Chanaan, from the face of his brother Jacob : for their sub-
                stance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land
                where they sojourned could not support them on account of
                the abundance of their stock.                            And Esau made his abode on
                mount Seir.             Esau is the same as Edom.
            9         Now these are the families of Esau, the father of the Edoin-
                ites, on mount Seir.                   And these are the names of Esau's sons
                â€”Eliphas son of Ada, Esau's wife ; and Baguel, son of Base-
                math, Esau's wife.
          11          And the sons of Eliphas were Thaiman, Omar, Sophar,
          12 Gotham and Kenez.                           And Thamna was a concubine of Eli-
                jxhas,     the son of Esau, and she bore to Eliphas, Amalek.
                These were the children of Ada the wife of Esau.
           13         And these are the sons of Baguel, Nachoth, Zare, Some
                and Mose.             These were the children of Basemath, the wife of
                Esau.
           14         And these are the children of Olibema the daughter of
                Ana, the son of Sebegon, the wife of Esau.                                      She bore to Esau,
                Jeous and Jeglom and Kore.
           15         These were the emirs of son Esau.                                  The sons of Eliphas,
                Esau's first born.                 Emir Thaiman, emir Omar, emir Sophar,
                 emir Kenez, emir Kore, emir Gothom, emir Amelek.                                                   These
                 were the emirs of Eliphas in the land of Idumea.                                          These were
           17 the children of Ada.                       And these were sons of Baguel, son of
                 Esau, emir Nachoth, emir Zare, emir Some, emir Mose.
      Ch. KXXVI.                   GENESIS.
         These were the emirs of Kaguel in the land of Edom.         These
      18 were the children of Basemath, the wife of Esau.       And these
         were the sons of Olibema the wife of Esau, emir Jeous, emir
         Jeglom, emir Kore.     These were the emirs of Olibema, the
         daughter of Ana, Esau's wife.       These were the children of
         Esau and these their Emirs.    They are the Edomites.
      20     Now these were sons of Seir the Chorrite, the inhabitant
      21 of the land, Lotan, Sobal, Sebegon, Ana, and Deson, and Asar,
         and Rison.   These were the emirs of the Chorriteâ€”of son Seir
      22 in the land of Edom.    And these were the sons of Lotan, Chor-
      23 ri and Aiman, and the sister of Lotan, Thainna.        And these
         were the sons of Sobal, Golain and Manachath and Gaibel and
      24 Sophar and Omar.      And these were the sons of Sebegon, Aie
         and Ana.    This is that Ana who found the Jameins in the wil-
      25 derness, when he was feeding his father Sebegon's asses.      And
         these were sons of Ana ; Deson and Olibema a daughter of
      26 Ana : And these were the sons of Deson, Amada and Asban
      27 and Ithran and Charran.      And these were the sons of Asar,
      28 Balaam and Zoukani and Joukam.          And these were the sons
         Rison, Os and Aran.
      29     And these were the emirs of the Chorrites, emir Lotan,
         emir Sobal, emir Sebegon, emir Ana, emir Deson, emir Asar,
         emir Rison.    These were the emirs of the Chorrites in their
         clans in the land of Edom.
      31     And these were the kings who reigned in Edom before a
      32 king reigned in Israel; Balak son of Beor reigned in Edom
      33 and the name of his city was Donnaba ; and when Balak died,
      34 Jobab son of Zara of Bosorra reigned in his stead; and when
          Jobab died, Asom of the land of the Thaimanites reigned in
      35 his stead ; and when Asom died, Adad son of Barad who
          smote Madiam in the plain of Moab reigned in his stead and
      36 the name of his city was Gethaim.       And when Adad died, Sa-
      37 macla of Masekka reigned in his stead ; and when Samada
          died, Saul of Rooboth which is by the river reigned in his
      38 stead ; and when Saul died, Ballenon son of Achobar reign-
          ed in his stead ; and when Ballenon son of Achobar died,
      31) Arad son of Barad reigned in his stead ; and the name of his
          city was Phogor, and his wife's name, Metebeel.       She was a
          daughter of ITatraith, son of Maizoob.
     Ch. XXXVII.              GENESIS.
     40    These are the names of the einirs of Esau in their tribes
        according to their place in their countries and their nations ;
     41 Emir of Thamna, emir of Grola, emir of Jether, emir of Olibe-
     42 mas, emir of Elas ; emir of Phinon, emir of Kenez, emir of
        Thaiman, emir of Mazar, emir of Magediel, emir of Zaphoin.
     43 These are the emirs of Edom in their respective abodes in
        the land of their possession.Esau and father Edom is the
        same.
     XXXVII.      Now Jacob dwelt in the land where his father had
        sojourned in the land of Chanaan ; and this is the history of
      2 Jacob's posterity.When Joseph was seventeen years of age
        and feeding his father's sheep with his brothers, as he was
        young, namely with the sons of Balla and the sons of Zelpha
        his father's wives, they carried an ill report against Joseph to
      3 Israel their father.Now Jacob loved Joseph above all his chil-
        dren because he was the son of his old age ; and he had made
      4 him a robe of different colours.So when his brothers saw that
        their father loved him more than all his sons, they hated him
      5 and could not speak peaceably to him. Besides Joseph hav-
        ing dreamed a dream told it to his brothers and said to them,
      6 Hear this dream which I have dreamed.  I thought we were
      7 binding sheaves in the middle of a field ; and my sheaf arose
        and stood upright, and your sheaves being ranged around
      8 made obeisance to my sheaf.  Upon which his brothers said
        to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us or have dominion over
      9 us ? So they hated him still more for his dreams and for his
        words. And he had another dream and told this to his father
        and his brothers and said, Behold, I have dreamed another
        dream, as if the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obei-
     10 sauce to me.  Upon which his father rebuked him saying,
        What is this dream which thou hast dreamed ? What ! Shall I
        and thy mother and thy brothers come and bow down to thee
     11 on the ground ?Sohis brothers envied him ; but his father pon-
    12 dered the matter.  After this his brothers having gone to Sy-
    13 chem to feed their father's flocks, Israel said to Joseph, Are
        not thy brothers tending the flocks at Sychem ?Come, let me
        send thee to them.And he said, I am ready.Whereupon Israel
        said to him, Gro and see if thy brothers and the flocks be well
     14 and bring me word. So lie despatched him from the valley of
      Oh. XXXVII.               GENESIS.
         Chebron and he went to Sychem : and a man found him wand-
      15 ering in the plain. And the man asked him saying, What art
      16 thou seeking ?  To which he replied, I am seeking my brothers,
      17 tell me where they are feeding.And the man said to him, They
         have removed from this place ; for I heard them say, Let us go
      18 to Dothaim.  So Joseph went after his brothers and found them
         at Dothaim.  Now when they saw him at a great distance be-
         fore he came near them, they wickedly thought of killing him
      19 and said one to another, Behold the dreamer is coming.   Now
      20 therefore come let us kill him and throw him into one of these
      21 pits, and we will say a savage beast hath devoured him.And let
         us see what will become of his dreams.But when Keuben heard
         he rescued him out of their hands and said, Let us not touch his
      22 life. Keuben indeed said to them, Shed not blood.      Throw
         him into one of these pits in the wilderness, but lay not a hand
         on him, in order that he might rescue him out of their hands
      23 and deliver him to his father.  So when Joseph came to his
         brothers they stripped him of the variegated robe which he had
      24 on and took him and threw him into the pit.   But the pit was
      25 empty.   It had no water.  Then they sat down to eat bread.
         And raising their eyes they looked ; and lo ! Ismaelite travel-
         lers were coming out of Galaad and their camels were loaded
         with spiceries, with balm and stacte, which they were carry-
      26 ing to Egypt.   Thereupon Judas said to his brothers, What
         advantage will it be though we slay our brother and conceal
      27 his blood ? Come let us sell him to these Ismaelites and let not
         our hands be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh.
      28 So his brothers hearkened to him.    And when the Madienite
         merchants came, they drew him up.      They lifted Joseph up
         out of the pit and sold him to the Ismaelites for twenty pieces
      29 of gold ; and they carried Joseph down to Egypt.   Now when
      30 Reuben came back to the pit and did not see Joseph in it, he
         rent his cloaths and returned to his brothers and said, The
      31 boy is gone. And as for me where now am I to go ? Then they
         took Joseph's coat, and having killed a kid of the goats they
         besmeared the coat with the blood and sent away the varie-
          gated robe and had it carried to his father and said, This we
      32 found.  Examine whether it be thy son's robe or not.  And he
      33 knew it and said, It is my son's robe. An evil beast hath de-
         XXXVIII.               GENESIS.
     Ch.
     34 voured him.  A wild beast hath torn Joseph.  Then Jacob rent
        his cloaths and put on sackcloth on his loins and mourned for
     35 his son many days.  And all his sons and daughters assembled
        and came to comfort him, but he would not be comforted say-
        ing, I will go to my son mourning, to the mansion of the dead.
     36 Thus his father mourned for him.     But the Madienites sold
        Joseph in Egypt to Petephres the chamberlain of Pharao, the
        captain of the guards.
     XXXVIII.       Now at that time Judas went down from his
        brothers and came to a certain Odollamite whose name was
      2 Eiras.  And Judas saw there a daughter of a Chananite, her
      3 name was Sava.    And he took her and went in unto her and
      4 she conceived and bore a son and called his name Er.     And
        she conceived again and bore a son and called his name Au-
      5 nan.  And she bore another son and called his name Selom.
      6 Now she was at Chasbi when she bore them.     And for Er his
      7 first born Judas took a wife whose name was Thamar.      But
        Er the first born of Judas was wicked in the sight of the Lord,
      8 and G-od slew him.   Whereupon Judas said to Aunan, Go in
        unto thy brother's wife and be a husband to her and raise up
      9 a seed for thy brother.  But when Aunan knew that the seed
        would not be his, it came to pass that when he went in unto his
        brother's wife he shed it on the ground; that he might not
     10 give seed to his brother. And it appeared evil in the sight of
        God that he had done this, therefore he caused him also to die.
     11 Then Judas said to Thamar his daughter in law, Continue a
        widow in thy father's house till my son Selom grow up.   For
     12 he said, Peradventure he also may die as his brothers did.So
        Thamar went and dwelt at her father's house.    But the time
        was prolonged and Sava the wife of Judas died. And when Ju-
        das was comforted he went up to his sheep shearers, he and his
     13 shepherd Eiras the Odollamite, to Thamna.    And it was told
        Thamar his daughter in law saying, Lo ! thy father in law is
     14 going up to Thamna to shear his sheep. Whereupon she put off
        the robes of her widowhood and put on a veil and adorned her-
        self and sat near the gates of Ainan in the way to Thamna.
        For she saw that Selom was grown up and that Jie had not
     15 given her to him for a wife.   And when Judas saw her, he
        thought she was a harlot, for she had covered her face and he

      Ch.
      16 did not know her.     So he turned aside to her and said to her,
         Let rne come in unto thee.     For he did not know that she was
      17 his daughter in law.    And she said, What wilt thou give me if
         thou come in unto me ? To which he replied, I will send thee
         a kid of the goats from the flock.   And she said, Wilt thou give
      18 me a pledge, till thou send it ? And he said, What pledge shall
         I give thee ? And she said, Thy ring and bracelet and the staff
         in thy hand.    So he gave them to her, and went in unto her, and
     19 she conceived by him.        Then she arose and went away, and
         took off her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.
     20 And Judas sent the kid of the goats by the hands of his shep-
         herd the Odollamite to receive from the woman the pledge.
     21 But he not finding her asked the men of the place, Where is
         the harlot that was at Ainan by the way side ?      And they said,
     22 There was not a harlot there.       Thereupon he returned to Ju-
         das and said, I have not found her.      And the men of the place
     23 said there was not a harlot there.      Then Judas said, Let her
         keep them.    But perhaps we may be laughed at.       I indeed sent
     24 the kid.    Thou however hast not found her.        Now after three
         months it was told Judas saying, Thamar thy daughter in law
         hath played the harlot, and lo ! she is with child by her whore-
         dom.   Whereupon Judas said, Bring her out and let her be
     25 burned.    And when she was brought out she sent to her father
         in law saying, By the man to whom these belong I am with
         child.  Moreover she said, Examine, whose is this ring and
     26 this bracelet and this staff? And Judas acknowledged them
         and said, Thamar hath more justice on her side than I, be-
         cause I did not give her to my son Selom.       And he proceeded
     27 no more to have knowledge of her.           And when the time of
     28 her delivery came she had twins.       And when she was in child
         birth, one put forth its hand, and the midwife took and tied a
         scarlet thread about its hand, saying, This will be the first
     29 born.   But when it had drawn back its hand, his brother im-
         mediately came forth.       Whereupon she said, What ! Hath
         there been a breach made for thee ? So she called his name
     30 Phares.    And after this his brother came forth, on whose hand
         was the scarlet thread.   So she called his name Zara.
     XXXIX.         Now when Joseph was brought to Egypt, Pete-

         an Egyptian, bought him at the hands ofthe Israelites, who had
       2 brought him thither.  And the Lord was with Joseph, so that
         he was a fortunate man and was in the same house with his
       3 master the Egyptian.  And his master perceived that the Lord
          was with him, and that the Lord prospered in his hands what-
       4 ever he did. So Joseph found favour in the sight of his mas-
          ter ;and he was pleased with him and set him over his
          household and committed all that he had to Joseph's charge.
       5 And after he had made him overseer of his household, and
          over all that he had, the Lord blessed the house of the Egyp-
          tian for Joseph's sake ; and there was a blessing of the Lord on
        6 all his substance, in his house and in his field.So he left to
          Joseph's management all that he had, and knew not any thing
          he had save the bread which he ate.
        7    Now Joseph was a comely j)erson an(j  f a very beautiful
          countenance, and after these things his master's wife cast her
       8 eyes on Joseph and said, Lie with me ; but he refused and
          said to his master's wife, Seeing my lord, on account of his
          confidence in me, knoweth not any thing in his house, and
       9 hath committed to my charge all that he hath and there is none
          in the family superior to me, nor any thing withheld from me,
          except thyself because thou art his wife ; how then can I do this
       10 wicked act and commit sin in the presence of God.And when
          she had spoken to Joseph day after day and he hearkened not
       11 to her to lie down with her to have commerce with her, it
          came to pass that one day when Joseph went into the house to
       12 transact his business and none of the domestics were within,
       13 she took hold of his mantle saying, Lie with me.But he leav-
          ing his mantle in her hands fled and went out.And when she
          saw that he had left his mantle in her hands and had fled and
       14 was gone, she called those who were in the house and spoke
          to them saying, See ! He hath brought in amongst us a He-
          brew slave to insult us.He came to me saying, Lie with me.
       15 But I cried Avith a loud voice.And when he heard that I
          raised my voice and cried aloud he left his mantle with me,
       16 fled and went out. And she kept the garment by her till his
       17 master came home and spoke to him in like terms saying, The
          Hebrew slave whom thou hast brought in amongst us came
          in to me to insult me and said to me, Let me lie with thee.
                                                                                                                 ;

         18 But when he heard that I raised rny voice and cried aloud
         19 leaving his mantle with me he fled and went out.                                       When his
              master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke saying,
              In this manner did thy slave treat me, he was greatly incensed.
         20 So Joseph's master took and cast him into prisonâ€”into the
         21 place where the king's prisoners were confined.                                     But in the
              prison the Lord was with Joseph, and continued his kindness
              and gave him favour in the sight of the principal keeper of the
         22 prison.         And the principal keeper of the prison committed to
              Joseph's care the prison and all the prisoners who were in
              the prison.          And whatever was done there, he was the person
         23 who caused it to be done.                      The principal keeper took no cog-
              nizance of any thing himself ; for all things were committed to
              Joseph's management, because the Lord was with him, and the
              Lord prospered in his hands whatever he did.
         XL.          Now alter these things it happened that the chief butler
              of the king of Egypt and the chief baker offended their lord the
          2 king of Egypt.               And Pharao was incensed against his two offi-
          3 cers, against the chief butler and against the chief baker and
              sent them under a guard to prisonâ€”to the place to which Jo-
          I seph had been sent.                  And the keeper of the prison committed
          5 them to Joseph and he attended them.                                 And when they had
              been there some days in prison, they both had a dream, in the
              same night.         And the appearance of the dream both of the chief
              butler and the chief baker, who belonged to the king of Egypt
          6 and were in prison, was similar.                         And in the morning when
          7 Joseph went in to them he saw that they were troubled.                                    AYhere-
              upon he asked the officers of Pharao who were confined with
              him at his master's, saying, Why are your countenances sad
          8 to day? And they said to him, We have had a dream and
              there is none to interpret it.                And Joseph said, Is not the inter-
          9 pretation thereof from God ? Therefore tell me.                                  So the chief
              butler told Joseph his dream and said, In my sleep there was a
        10 vine before me, and on the vine three branches and one was
              flourishing and had produced clusters, and the grapes of one
         11 cluster were ripe.               And I had in my hand the cup of Pharao.
              So I took the bunch and squeezed it into the cup and gave the
         12 cup into Pharao's hand.                     Thereupon Joseph said to him, This
              is the interpretation of it.                 The three branches are three days.
                                                                                                           ;!
           Ch. XLI.                                GENESIS.
           13 Three days hence Pharao will take cognizance of thy adminis-
                tration and restore thee to thy office ofcup bearer, and thou shalt
                give Pharao's cup into his hand according to thy former dignity,
           14 when thou wast butler.                  But think of me by thy own case,
                when it shall be well with thee ; and do me the favour to men-
           15 tion me to Pharao and release me from this prison.                             For I have
               been stolen from the land of the Hebrews ; and here I have
                done nothing, yet they have thrown me into this dungeon.
          16 And when the chief baker saw that he interpreted well he said
               to Joseph, I also had a dream, I thought I was carrying on my
               head three baskets of cakes, and in the uppermost basket,
          17 pastry of all the sorts which Pharao eateth.                           And the birds of
               the air devoured those in the uppermost basket on my head.
          18 And Joseph answered and said to him, This is the interpre-
               tation thereof.         The three baskets are three days.                    Three days
          19 hence Pharao will take off thy head and hang thee on a gibbet
          20 and the birds of the air will devour thy flesh.                           Accordingly it
               fell out, that the third day was Pharao's birth day, and he
               made an entertainment for all his servants and took cognizance
               of the administration of the butler, and the administration of
          21 the baker in the midst of his servants.                         And he restored the
               butler to his office, and he gave the cup into Pharao's hand.
               But the chief baker he hanged as Joseph had interpreted to
          22 them.        Yet the chief butler made no mention of Joseph, but
               passed him over in oblivion.
          XLI.          But it happened that at the end of two years Pharao had
           2 a dream.          He thought he was standing by the river ; and lo
              there came up out of the river seven cows of a beautiful figure
           3 and very fat; and they fed on the sedge.                             And seven other
              cows came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and lean
           4 and they fed near the other cows on the bank of the river ; and
              the seven ill favoured and lean cows devoured the seven cows
              which were of a beautiful figure and full of flesh.                         And Pharao
              awoke.
           5       Again he dreamed a second time ; and lo ! seven ears of
           6 corn sprang upon one stalk, choice and good : and lo ! seven
           7 ears thin and blasted sprang up after them.                       Andthe seven thin
              and blasted ears devoured the seven ears which were choice
          8 and full.        And Pharao awoke ; and it was a dream.                        And in the
                               GENESIS.
     Ch. XLI.
        morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent for all the inter-
        preters of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof, and told them
        his dream, but there was none who could interpret it to Pharao.
      9 Upon this the chief butler spoke to Pharao, saying, I this day
     10 acknowledge my fault.   Pharao was angry with his servants,
        and ordered us to be confined in the house of the captain of
     11 the guardsâ€”both me and the chief baker.   And both I and he
        had a dream the same night, each had a dream regarding hini-
     12 self. And there was there with us a youth, a Hebrew servant
        of the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpret-
     13 ed to us. And it fell out as he interpreted to usâ€”I was restor-
     14 ed to my office ; but he was hanged. Upon this Pharao sent
        for Joseph, and they brought him out of the prison.And when
        they had shaved him and changed his raiment, he came to
     15 Pharao.  And Pharao said to Joseph, I have had a dream and
        there is none who can interpret it.But I have heard people
        say of thee, that upon hearing dreams thou canst interpret
     16 them.  In reply to which, Joseph said to Pharao, Without God
     17 no answer of peace can be given to Pharao.     Then Pharao
        spoke to Joseph saying, In my sleep I thought I was standing
     18 near the edge of the river ; and there came up as it were out
        of the river, seven cows of a beautiful figure, and very fat ; and
     19 they fed on the sedge.   And lo ! seven other cows came up
        after them, out of the river, ugly and ill favoured and lean of
        flesh ; such that I never saw worse in all the land of Egypt.
     20 And the seven ill favoured and lean cows devoured the first se-
     21 ven cows which were choice and good.    But though they de-
        voured them, they gave no sign of fuluess. Their appearance
        was as ugly as before.
     22     Then I awoke and again went to sleep, and in my sleep 1
        again saw as if seven ears of corn sprang up, on one stalk, full
     23 and good ; and adjoining them seven other ears sprang up,
     24 thin and blasted. And the seven thin and blasted ears devour-
        ed the seven ears which were full and good. Now I have told
        the interpreters ; but there is not one who can interpret this to
     25 me.   Then Joseph said to Pharao, The dream of Pharao is one.
     26 God hath shewn Pharao what he is about to do.     The seven
        beautiful cows are seven years ; and the seven good ears are
     27 seven years.  The dream of Pharao is one.   The seven lean
       Ch. XLI.                   GENESIS.
           cows also which came up after them are seven years ; and the
           seven thin and blasted ears are seven years.  There shall be
       28 seven years of famine.  This is the thing which I have said to
       29 Pharao, God hath shewn Pharao what he is about to do.      Be-
          hold seven years are coming of great plenty in all the land of
       30 Egypt.   But after these there will come seven years of famine.
          And they will cause the coming plenty to be forgotten in all
       31 Egypt.   And the famine will consume the land, so that the
          plenty will not be known in the land, by reason of the famine
       32 which will come after it : for it will be very great.And in as
          much as the dream of Pharao was doubled, the thing which
          God had determined will surely come to pass ; and God is
       33 hasting to do it.  Now therefore look out for a man of pru-
          dence and understanding, and set him over the land of Egypt.
       34 And let Pharao appoint and set governors of districts over the
          whole land, and let them send in a fifth of all the products of
       35 the land of Egypt, during the seven years of plenty, and col-
          lect all the eatables of those seven good years which are com-
          ing.  And let food be collected under the care of Pharao, and
       36 eatables stored in the cities.So shall food be kept in the coun-
          try, against the seven years of famine which will be in the land
          of Egypt, and the country will not be wasted with the famine.
       37    And the advice was agreeable in the view of Pharao and in
       38 the view of all his servants.  And Pharao said to all his ser-
          vants, Can we find such a man as this who hath in him the
       39 spirit of God ? Then Pharao said to Joseph, Seeing God hath
          shewn thee all these things, there is none more prudent and
       40 wise than thou thyself. Thou shalt be over my household and
          to thy command all my people shall pay obedience.    Only on
       41 the throne will I be greater than thou. Moreover Pharao said
          to Joseph, Behold I have set thee this day over all the land of
       42 Egypt,   And Pharao took off the ring from his own hand and
          put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him with a cotton robe,
          and put a chain of gold about his neck ; and caused him to
       43 mount a chariot next to that of his own.   And a herald made
          proclamation before him.  And when he had set him over all
       44 the land of Egypt, Pharao said to Joseph, I am Pharao. With-
          out thee no man shall lift up his hand in all the land of Egypt.
       45 And Pharao called Joseph's name Psonthomphanech and gave
                                                                                                                          ;

              to be his wife.
        46          Now Joseph was thirty years old, when he stood before Pha-
              rao king of Egypt.                    And Joseph went out from the presence
        47 of Pharao and went through all the land of Egypt.                                            And in the
              seven years of plenty the land produced in vast abundance and
        48 he collected all the varieties of food of those seven years, in
              which there was plenty in the land of Egypt and stored it in
         49 the cities.            In every city he stored the eatable productions of
               the fields around.              So Joseph collected food like the sand of the
              sea in great abundance until it could not be numbered, for it
         50 was innumerable.                   Now before the seven years of famine Joseph
              had two sons, whom Aseneth the daughter of Petephres the
         51 priest of Heliopolis bore to him.                             And Joseph called the name
              of his first born Manasses, because God hath made me forget
         52 all my troubles and all my father's family.                                      And the name of
               his second son he called Ephraim, because God hath made me
               fruitful in the land of my affliction.
         53          And when the seven years of plenty which had been in
               the land of Egypt were past, the seven years of famine began
         54 to come as Joseph said.                         And there was a famine in the whole
         55 earth, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.                                          And when
               all the land of Egypt began to be in want and the people cried
               to Pharao for bread, Pharao said to all the Egyptians, Go to
               Joseph and do whatever he saith to you.
         56         As the famine was over the face of the whole earth, when
               Joseph opened all his granaries and sold to all the Egyptians,
               all the countries came to Egypt to buy of Joseph, for the fa-
         XLIL              mine was great in the whole earth.                                 And when Jacob
               found that there was a sale in Egypt he said to his sons, Why
           2 sit ye still ? Behold I have heard that there is corn in Egypt
               go down thither and buy us a little food that we may live and
           3 not die.          So Joseph's ten brothers went down to purchase corn
               from Egypt : but Benjamin the brother of Joseph he did not
           4 send with his brothers ; for he said, Perhaps some misfortune
               may happen to him.
           5         Now when the sons of Israel went to buy in company with
               others who were going, for the famine was in the land of Cha-
           6 naan, Joseph was the governor of the country ; he sold to all
         Ch. XLTI.                          GENESIS.
             the people of that land.       So when Joseph's brothers came they
          7 made obeisance to him with their face to the ground.                      And
             when Joseph saw his brothers he knew them and was reserv-
             ed and spoke harshly to them and said to them, Whence come
             you ? And they said, From the land of Chanaan to buy food.
          8 Now Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him.
          9 And Joseph remembered the dreams, which he had dreamed
             and said to them, You are spies.              You are come to examine
         10 the ways into this country.          And they said, No, my lord.           We
         11 thy servants are come to buy food.             We are all the sons of one
             man.       re are men of peace.       Thy servants               spies.   But
         12           W                                             are not
             he said, Nay, you are come for no other purpose, but to ex-
         13 amine the ways into this country.              Then they said, Thy ser-
             vants were twelve brothers in the land of Chanaan.                  And lo !
             the youngest is now with our father ; but the other is no more.
         14 Upon this Joseph said, It is as I said, you are spies.                By this
         15 you shall be proved.         By the health of Pharao you shall not
         16 depart hence unless your youngest brother come hither.                   Send
             one of you and bring your brother ; but you must be con-
             fined, until your words be proved whether you speak true or
         17 not.    If not, by the health of Pharao you are certainly spies.
         18 So he committed them to prison three days.                And on the third
         19 day he said to them, Do this and live ; for I fear God.                 If you
             are men of peace let one brother of you be kept in confinement.
         20 As for the rest, go and carry back your purchase of provisions
             and bring your younger brother to me, so shall your words be
         21 believed.     Unless you do this you shall die.            On this occasion
             they acted thusâ€”they said one to another, We indeed are to
             blame in respect to our brother.            Because we disregarded the
         22 anguish of his soul, when he intreated us and we would not
             hear him ; for this cause therefore this affliction is come upon
             us.   And Keuben in reply said to them, Did I not speak to
             you saying, Do the lad no injury, but you hearkened not to
         23 me.     Now behold inquisition is made for his blood.               They in-
             deed did not know that Joseph heard; for there was one to
         24 interpret between them.          On this Joseph withdrew from them
             and wept.      Then he came to them again and spoke to them
             and he took Symeon from among them and bound him before
         25 their eyes.      Then Joseph gave orders to fill their sacks with
          XLIIL                     GENESIS.
     Oh.
         corn and to put every one's money in his bag and to furnish
     2b* them with provisions for the journey.       So this being done for
         them they loaded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
     27 And one of them having loosed his bag to give his asses pro-
         vender at a place where they lodged saw his roll of money, for
     28 it was in the mouth of his bag, and said to his brothers, The
         money is returned to me.       See, here it is in my bag.     Where-
         upon their heart fainted and they were alarmed and said one
     29 to another, What is this which God hath done to us ?              And
         when they came to their father Jacob to the land of Chanaan,
     30 they told him all that had happened to them and said, The
         man the lord of the country spoke harshly to us and put us in
     31 prison as coming to spy the country ; and we told him, We
     32 are men of peace, We are not spies.          We are twelve brothers,
         sons of one father.   One is no more.      And the youngest is now
     33 with our father in the land of Chanaan.         Upon which the man
         the lord of the country said to us, By this I shall know that
         you are men of peace.      Leave here with me one brother ; and
         taking the corn purchased for your family go and bring me
     34 your younger brother, then I shall know that you are not
         spies ; but men of peace.     And I will restore to you your bro-
     35 ther and you may traffick in the land.       And when they emptied
         their sacks every one's roll of money was in their several sacks.
         And when they and their father saw their rolls of money they
     36 were terrified.    And Jacob their father said to them, Me you
         have bereaved of children.      Joseph is gone.     Symeon is gone.
         And willyou take away Benjamin ? All these things are against
     37 me.    Then Reuben spoke to their father saying, Slay my two
         sons, if I bring him not back to thee.         Commit him to my
     38 charge and I will bring him back to thee.            But he said, My
         son shall not go down with you.        For his brother is dead and
         he alone is left.   If any mischief should happen to him in the
         way you are going, you will bring down my old age with sor-
         row to the mansion of the dead.
     XLIIL       Still the famine prevailed in the land.    So when they had
       2 eaten up the corn which they brought from Egypt their father
       3 said to them, Go again and buy for us a little food.          AVhere-
         upon Judas spoke to him and said, The man who is the lord of
         the country solemnly protested saying, You shall not see my
             VOL. I.                      K

        4 face, unless your youngest brother be with you.  If therefore
          thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy
          thee food.  But if thou wilt not send our brother with us we
        5 will not go. For the man spoke to us saying, You shall not see
        6 my face unless your youngest brother be with you.   And Is-
          rael said, Why did you do me this ill in telling the man that
        7 you had a brother?    And they said, The man examined us
          strictly touching our family and said, Is your father alive? And
          have you a brother ? And we answered him according to this
          examination.  Could we know that he would say, Bring your
        8 brother ? Moreover Judas said to his father Israel, Send thy
          son with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not
        9 die, both we and thou and all that we have. I undertake the
          charge of him. At my hand require him.    If I bring him not
          back to thee and set him before thee let me be a sinner against
       10 thee for ever.For if we had not been delayed we might have
       11 now been back a second time.  Then Israel their father said to
          them, If it must be so, do this, Take of all the fruits of this
          land in your vessels and carry down for the man presents of
          balm and honey and incense both stacte and terebinthus and
       12 almonds.  Take also double money in your hands and carry
          back the money which was returned in your sacks ; perhaps it
       13 was a mistake.  And take your brother and arise and go down
       14 to the man.  And may my God grant you favour in the sight
          of the man that he may send back your brother with Benjamin.
          As for me I am bereaved of children as I have been bereaved.
       15 So the men took the presents and the double money in their
          hands and Benjamin and arose and went down to Egypt and
       16 stood before Joseph.  And when Joseph saw them and Benja-
          min his brother by the same mother he said to his steward,
          conduct these men into the house and kill victims and make
       17 ready, for these men are to dine with me at noon.So the man
          did as Joseph ordered and conducted them to Joseph's house.
       18 And when the men saw that they were conducted to Joseph's
          house, they said, On account of the money which was return-
          ed in our bags in the former journey we are brought in for the
          purpose of accusing us and charging us with it, that he may
       19 make us slaves and take our asses. Therefore they went near
          to the man the steward of Joseph's house and spoke to him at
                                                                    â€”

    20 the gate of the house saying, Sir, we caine down for the first
    21 time to purchase provisions, hut when we came to the lodging
        place and opened our bags every man's money was in his bag.
        This money we have now brought back in our hands in full weight.
        And we have brought with us other money to buy provisions
     22 Who put the money into our bags we do not know.          Upon
     23 which he said to them, Peace be to you : fear not, your God
        and the God of your fathers hath given you treasures in your
        bags.  But as for your money, with perfect good will I decline
     24 receiving it.  Then he brought out Symeon to them and
        brought them water to wash their feet and gave provender to
     25 their asses. And they were employed in making ready the
        presents until Joseph came at noon, for they heard that he was to
     26 dine there. So when Joseph came home they brought him the
        presents which they had in their hands into the house and made
     27 obeisance to him with their face on the ground.  And he asked
     28 them of their welfare and said to them, Is your father well,
        the old man of whom you spoke ?   Is he still living ?Andthey
        said, Thy servant, our father is well. He is still alive. And
        he said, Blessed of God is that man.   Whereupon they bowed
     29 down and made obeisance to him.     And when Joseph raised his
        eyes and saw Benjamin his brother by the same mother, he
        said, This is your youngest brother whom you promised to
        bring to me ?  Then he said, God be gracious to thee, my son.
     30 And Joseph was discomposed, for his bowels yearned towards
        his brother ; so he sought where to weep and went into his
     31 chamber and wept there.     And when he had washed his face
        and come out he restrained himself and said, Serve up dinner.
     32 So they served up for him by himself and for them by them-
        selves, and for the Egyptians who dined with him, by them-
        selves. For the Egyptians could not eat bread with the He-
     33 brews.  For that to the Egyptians is an abomination. And they
        sat before him, the first born according to his birth right and
        the youngest according to his youth.   And the men were asto-
     31 nished, one at another.  And when they received their several
        messes from him, the mess of Benjamin was five times larger
        than any of theirs.
     XLIV.      And when they had drank and been plentifully regaled
        with him Joseph gave orders to the steward of his house say-

                 ing, Fill the bags of these men with corn, as much as they
             2 can carry, and put every one's money in the mouth of his bag,
                 and put my silver cup in the bag of the youngest along with
             3 the price of his corn.                  And Joseph's orders being punctually
                 executed ; the next morning as soon as it was light the men
             4 were sent away they and their asses.                          And when they were gone
                 out of the city, but had not got far off, Joseph said to his stew-
                 ard, Arise and pursue those men ; and when thou shalt over-
             5 take them, say to them, Why have you returned evil for good ?
                 Why have you stolen my silver cup ?                         Is not this it out of which
                 my lord drinketh.               By it indeed he diviueth.                   You have done
             6 evil in so doing.             So when he overtook them he spoke to them
             7 in these terms.              Upon which they said to him, Why doth my
                 lord speak in such terms as these : Far be it from thy servants
             8 to do such an act.                  If we indeed brought back to thee from
                 the land of Chanaan the money which we found in our bags,
                 how should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold ?
             9 With whomsoever of thy servants thou shalt find the cup, let
           10 him die, and we will be our lord's slaves.                               And he said, Well
                 Let it be as you say thus farâ€”With whomsoever the cup be
           11 found, he shall be my slave ; but you shall be blameless.                                       Then
                 they hasted, and set down, every one his bag on the ground,
           12 and opened, every one his bag.                          And he searched beginning at
                 the eldest till he came to the youngest ; and he found the cup
            13 in Benjamin's bag.                 Whereupon they rent their cloaths and put
            14 every one his bag on his ass and returned to the city.                                          And
                 Judas with his brothers went in to Joseph who was still there ;
            15 and they fell on the ground before him.                               And Joseph said to
                 them, What is this you have done?                              Did you not know that
            16 such a man as I can divine?                            And Judas said, What answer
                 can we make to my lord ?                         Or what can we say ?                   Or how
                 can we justify ourselves ?                  God hath indeed found out the ini-

            17 we and he with whom the cup was found.                                     And Joseph said,
                 Far be it from me to do such a thing.                              The man with whom
                 the cup was found shall be my servant ; but as for you go up
            18 in peace to your father.                     Upon this Judas came near to him
                 and said,           my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy pre-
                 sence and be not angry with thy servant, for thou art next to

      19 Pharao.    Thou my lord didst ask thy servants saying, Have
      20 yon a father or a brother ?     And we said to my lord, We have
          a father an old man ; and he hath a younger son of his old age.
          His brother is dead, and as he is the only one of his mother
      21 left ; his father loveth him.    Then thou saidst to thy servants,
      22 Bring him down to me and I will take care of him.            And we
          said to my lord, This son cannot leave his father ; for if he
      23 were to leave him, his father would die.       Then thou saidst to
          thy servants, Unless your younger brother come down with
      24 you, you shall no more be admitted to see my face.          So when
          we went up to thy servant our father, we told him the words
      25 of our lord.    And when our father said, Go again and buy for
       26 us a little food ; we said, We cannot go.     If indeed our young-
          est brother will go down with us, we will go down.          For we
          cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother be with
      27 us.   Thereupon thy servant our father said to us, You know
          that my wife bore me two sons ; and that one went out from
      28 me and you said he was devoured by a wild beast and I have
      29 not seen him since.      If therefore you take this one also from
          me and any misfortune happen to him on the journey, you will
      30 bring down my old age with sorrow to the grave.          Now there-
          fore if I should go to thy servant our father and this son be
          not with us, as his life dependeth on the life of this son, it will
          come to pass that when he shall see that this son is not with
       31 us he will die.   Thus will thy servants bring down the old age
       32 of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.       Besides as
          thy servant received this son from his father and said, If I bring
          him not back to thee and set him before thee, let me be as a
       33 sinner against my father for ever ; now therefore let me stay
          with thee instead of him as a slave to my lord, and let this son
       34 go up with his brothers (for how can I go up to my father and
          this son not with us ?) that I may not see the evils which will
          befal my father.
      XLV.        Upon this Joseph could not restrain himself before all
          his attendants, but said, Dismiss all from me.        So there was
        2 no attendant with Joseph when he made hiinself known to his
          brothers, but in weeping he raised his voice so that all the
          Egyptians heard and the news was carried to Pharao's house,
        3 And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph.         Is  my father
       Ch. XLV.                      GENESIS.
           still alive ? But his brothers could not answer him ; for they
        4 were confounded.     Then Joseph said to his brothers, Come
           near to me?    And when they came near; he said, I am Joseph
        5 your brother whom you sold into Egypt.           Now therefore be
           not grieved, nor let it afflict you that you sold me hither;
        6 for Clod sent me before you for life.   For this is but the second
           year of famine on the earth and there will be yet five years, in
        7 which there will be neither tillage nor harvest, so that God hath
          sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on the earth
        8 and to nourish your great remnant.    Nowtherefore it was not you
          who sent me hither, but it was God.     And he hath made me like
          a father to Pharao, and lord of all his house and governor of all
        9 the land of Egypt.    Haste therefore and go up to my father and
          say to him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me
          ruler of all the land of Egypt.   Come down therefore to me and
       10 tarry not.  And thou shalt dwelt in the land of Gesem-Arabia
          and be near me ; both thou and thy sons and thy grandsons,
       11 thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast.        And I will
          nourish thee there, (for the famine will continue five years
          longer) that thou and thy sons and all that belong to thee may
       12 not be consumed.     Behold your eyes and the eyes of my bro-
          ther Benjamin see that it is my mouth which speaketh to you.
       13 Therefore tell my father all my glory in Egypt and all that you
       14 see ; and make haste and bring my father down hither.         Then
          he fell upon the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept upon
       15 him.   And Benjamin wept on his neck.       And he kissed all his
          brothers and wept upon them.      And after that his brothers con-
          versed with him.
       16     Now when the news spread to Pharao's house saying, Jo-
          seph's brothers are come, Pharao and his servants were re-
       17 joiced.  And Pharao said to Joseph, Say to thy brothers, Do
       18 this, Load your beasts and go to the land of Chanaan and
          take up your father and all that you have and come to me and
          I will give you of all the good things of Egypt, and ye shall eat
       19 the fat of the land.     And do thou issue these orders, Take
          with you from the land of Egypt waggons for your children
       20 and your wives and take up your father and come; and pay
          no regard to your furniture, for all the good things of Egypt
       21 shall be yours.   And the sons of Israel did so.      And Joseph
      Oh. XLVI.                 GENESIS.
      22 gave them waggons as Pharao the king commanded.    He gave
         them also provisions for the journey.And to all he gave two
         suits of raiment ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces
     23 of gold and five distinguished suits of raiment.And he sent
         the like presents to his father together with ten asses which
         carried some of all the good things of Egypt, and ten mules
     24 loaded with bread for his father on the journey.And he dismis-
         sed them : And as they were departing, he said to them, See that
     25 you do not fall out by the way. So they went up out of Egypt
         and came to the land of Chanaan to their father Jacob and told
     26 him saying.   Thy son Joseph is alive and he is the governor
        of all the land of Egypt.   Whereupon Jacob was absorpt in
     27 thought, for he could not believe them.  But when they told
        him all that Joseph had commanded them, and he saw the
        waggons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Ja-
     28 cob their father revived. And Israel said, It is a great thing
        for me that my son Joseph is still alive.1 will go and see him,
        before I die.
     XLYI.      Then Israel removed with all that he had and went to
         Well of the Oath, and offered a sacrifice to the God of his fa-
      2 ther Isaak. And God spoke to Israel in a vision of the night
      3 and said, Jacob ! Jacob !And he said, Here I am.   And God
        said to him, I am the God of thy fathers.Fear not to go down
      4 into Egypt ; for I will make thee there a great nation.I indeed
        will go down with thee into Egypt and I will at last cause
        thee to come up, when Joseph shall have put his hands on
      5 thy eyes.  Then Jacob arose from Well of the Oath and the
        sons of Israel put their father, and the baggage and their
        wives in the waggons which Joseph had sent to carry him ;
      6 and taking their stock and all their effects which they had
      7 gotten in the land of Chanaan, Jacob and all his seed with him,
        his sons and his grandsons, his daughters and his granddaugh-
        ters with him went to Egypt. So he brought all his offspring
        to Egypt.
      8    Now these are the names of Israel's children who went
        down to Egypt with their father Jacob.
                          Jacob and his Children.
      9    The first born of Jacob was Reuben, and the sons of Reu-

       10      And the sons of Symeon, Jemuel and Jainin and Aod and
           Achin and Saar and Saul the son of a Chananitish woman.
       11      And the sons of Levi, Gerson, Kaath and Merari.
       12      And the sons of Judas were Er and Aunan and Seloni and
           Phares and Zara but Er and Aunan died in the land of Cha-
           naan.   And the sons of Phares were Esron and Jemuel.
       13      And the sons of Issachar were Thola and Phua and Asum
           and Sambran.
       14      And the sons of Zabulon, Sered and Allon and Achoel.
       15      These were the sons of Leia whom she bore to Jacob in
           Syrian Mesopotamia with Deina his daughter.         All the souls,
           sons and daughters were thirty three.
       16      And the sons of Gad ; Saphon and Aggis and Sannis and
           Thasoban and Aodeis and Aroedeis and Areeleis.
       17      And the sons of Aser ; Jemna and Jessua and Jeus and
       18 Baria with Sara their sister.     And the sons of Baria ; Chobar
           and Melchiil.    These were the children of Zelpha whom La-
           ban gave to his daughter Leia and she bore them to Jacob.
           Sixteen souls.
       19     And the children of Rachel the wife of Jacob were Joseph
       20 and Benjamin.      And to Joseph children were born in the land
           of Egypt, whom Aseneth the daughter of Petephres, the priest
           of Heliopolis, bore to him, namely, Manasses and Ephraim.
           And to Manasses, there were sons born, Avhom his concubine
           Syra bore to him, namely, Machir.      And Machir begot Galaad.
           And the sons of Ephraim the brother of Manasses were Sou-
           talaam and Taam.     And the sons of Soutalaam, Edom.
       21     And the sons of Benjamin were Bala and Bochor and As-
           bel.  And to Bala there were sons born, namely, Gera and ISoe-
           man and Achis and Bos and Mamphim, and Gera begot Arad.
       22 These, were the children of Bachel, whom she bore to Jacob.
           All the souls were eighteen.
       23     And the sons of Dan; Asom.         And the sons of Nephtha-

       25 children of Balla whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel,
       26 and she bore them to Jacob.      All the souls, seven.    So all the
           souls who went with Jacob into Egypt, even all who sprung
           from him, exclusive of the wives of Jacob's childrenâ€”All the
       27 souls were sixty six.   And including the children of Joseph who

              were born to hiui in the land of Egypt, being nine, all the souls
              of Jacob's house who came with Jacob into Egypt were se-
              venty five.
        28           Now he had sent Judas before him to Joseph, that he
        29 might meet him at Heroopolis, in the land of Harnesses.                                                            And
              Joseph having got ready his chariots, went up to meet his fa-
              ther Israel at Heroopolis.                          And when he saw him he fell on his
        30 neck and wept abundantly.                                    And Israel said to Joseph, Now-
              let me die, since I have seen thy face, for thou art still alive.
        31 Then Joseph said to his brothers, I will go up and inform Pha-
              rao, and tell him that my brothers, my father's family who
        32 were in the land of Chanaan, are come to me ; but the men are
              shepherds ; for their occupation hath been to feed cattle, and
              they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they
        33 have.            If therefore Pharao send for you and say to you, What
        34 is your occupation ? you will say, We thy servants are feeders
              of cattle from our youth even to this time, as well as our fa-
              thers ; that you may dwell in Geseru-Arabia.                                              For every shep-
              herd is an abomination to the Egyptians.
        XLVII.                  So Joseph went and told Pharao saying, My father
              and my brothers with their flocks and their herds and all that
              belong to them are come from the land of Chanaan ; and lo
          2 they are in the land of Gesem.                                       And he took of his brothers
          3 five men and presented them before Pharao.                                                 And Pharao said
              to Joseph's brothers, What is your occupation ? and they said
              to Pharao, Thy servants are shepherds, both we and our fa-
          4 thers.           Moreover they said to Pharao, We are come to sojourn
              in this land, because there is no pasture for thy servants' cattle,
              for the famine hath been great in the land of Chanaan.                                                          Now
              therefore let us sojourn in the land of Gesem.                                            And Pharao said
              to Joseph, Let them dwell in the land of Gesem ; and if thou
               knowest any men of ability among them, make them over-
               seers of my cattle.
          5          Now when Jacob and his sons came into Egypt to Joseph
               and Pharao king of Egypt heard of it he said to Joseph, Thy
          6 father and thy brothers are come to thee, behold the land of
               Egypt is before thee, settle thy father and thy brothers in the
           7 best of the land.                     And when Joseph introduced his father Ja-
               cob and presented him before Pharao and Jacob had blessed
                     VOL. I.                                          L
         XLVII.                GENESIS.
      Oh.
       8 Pharao, Pharao said to Jacob, How many are the years of the
       9 days of thy life ? And Jacob said to Pharao, The days of the
         years of my life which I am now sojourning are a hundred and
         thirty years.Few and evil have been the days of the years of
         my life. They have not reached to the days of the years of the
      10 life of my fathers which they sojourned.And when Jacob had
      11 blessed Pharao he went out from him.   And Joseph settled
         his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the
         land of Egypt, in the best of the land of Ramesses, as Pharao
      12 had ordered. And Joseph supplied his.father and his brothers
         and all his father's household with a certain portion of corn for
         each person.
      13    Now there was no food in the land, for the famine pre-
         vailed exceedingly ; and both the land of Egypt and the land
      14 of Chanaan fainted by reason of the famine.And Joseph col-
         lected all the money which was found in the land of Egypt
         and in the land of Chanaan for the corn which they bought
      15 and which he dealt out to them. And Joseph brought all the
         money to Pharao's house.  And when all the money was gone,
         out of the land of Egypt and out of the land of Chanaan, all
         the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, Give us bread. Must
      16 we die in thy presence because we have no money ? There-
         upon Joseph said to them, Briug your cattle, and I will give
      17 you bread for your cattle if your money be gone.   So they
         brought their cattle to Joseph, and he gave them bread for their
         horses and for their flocks and for their herds and for their as-
         ses and supplied them with bread that year for all their cattle.
      18 When that year was ended they came to him the next year
         and said, Perhaps we may be rejected by our lord : for as our
         money is gone and our stock and cattle are transferred to thee
         our lord, there is indeed nothing left us in the presence of our
      19 lord, but our persons and our lands. That we therefore may
         not die in thy presence and the land become a waste, purchase
         us and our land for bread, and we with our lands will be ser-
         vants to Pharao. Give us seed that we may sow and live and
      20 not die. So the land will not become desolate.Upon this Jo-
         seph purchased all the land ofthe Egyptians for Pharao.For the
          Egyptians sold their land to Pharao, because the famine pre-
      21 vailed over them.  Thus the land became Pharao's, and he re-

     Ck. XLVIII.
        duced the people to a state of vassalage from one border of
     22 Egypt to the other, save the land of the priests only.   This
        Joseph did not buy ; because Pharao had assigned them a gra-
        tuitous portion, and they ate the portion which Pharao assign-
     23 ed them.  Therefore they did not sell their land.Then Joseph
        said to all the Egyptians, Behold I have this day purchased
     24 you and your land for Pharao.    Take seed and sow the land.
         And of the products thereof you shall give Pharao the fifth.
        And the other four parts shall be your own to sow the land,
     25 and to be food for you and all your families.  And they said,
         Thou hast saved our lives.We have found favour in the sight
     26 of our lord, and we will be servants to Pharao. So Joseph en-
        joined upon them the giving a fifth to Pharao as a statute which
         continueth even to this day in all the land of Egypt, excepting
         only the land ofthe priests.That did not belong to Pharao.
     27     Thus Israel became sojourners in the land of Egypt in the
         district of Gesem, and they had possessions therein and in-
     28 creased and multiplied exceedingly.   And Jacob lived in the
         land of Egypt seventeen years.  And all the days of the years
         of his life were a hundred and forty seven years.
     29     Now when the time of Israel's death drew nigh he sent for
         his son Joseph and said to him, If I have found favour in thy
         sight, put thy hand under my thigh and thou shalt deal kindly
      30 and truly with me, that thou wilt not bury me in Egypt ; but
         let me sleep with my fathers.  Therefore thou shalt carry me
      31 out of Egypt and bury me in their sepulchre.    And he said I
         will do as thou hast said.  And he said, Swear to me.  So he
         swore to him.  And Israel bowed down on the head of his staff.
      XLVIII.      After this when it was told Joseph, Thy father is
         sick, he took his two sons Manasses and Ephraim and went to
       2 Jacob.  And when they told Jacob saying, Behold thy son Jo-
         seph is coming to thee, Israel strengthened himself and sat
       3 upon the bed.   And Jacob said to Joseph, My God appeared
         to me at Louza in the land of Chanaan and blessed me and
       4 said, Behold I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and
         make thee a multitude of nations, and I will give thee this land
       5 even to thy seed after thee for a perpetual possession.  Now
         therefore thy two sons, who have been bom to thee in the land
         of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, are mine.Ephraim

                  thy mother died in the land of Chanaan, just as I drew near
                  the race ground of Chabratha on the way to Ephratha.                                                             So I
                   buried her in the way of the race ground the same is Bethle-
              8 hem.           Then Israel seeing the sons of Joseph said, Who are
              9 these with thee ? And Joseph said to his father, They are my
            10 sons, whom God hath given me here.                                              Whereupon Jacob said,
                  Bring them near to me that I may bless them.                                                     Now Israel's
                  eyes were dim by reason of old age and he could not see clearly.
                  And when he brought them near to him, he kissed them and
            1      embraced them.                   And Israel said to Joseph, Lo ! was I not de-
                  prived of thy presence ? yet behold God hath shewn me even
            12 thy seed.                Then Joseph took them from his knees; and when
            13 they had made obeisance to him with their face to the ground,
                  Joseph taking his two sons, Ephraim in his right hand towards
                  Israel's left and Manasses in his left hand towards Israel's right,
            14 brought them near to him.                                 But Israel stretching out his right
                  hand laid it on Ephraim's head (now he was the youngest) and
            15 his left hand on Manasses' head crossing his hands.                                                           And he
                  blessed them and said, The God whom my fathers Abraham
                   and Isaak worshippedâ€”the God who hath fed me from my
            16 youth to this dayâ€”the Angel who delivered me from all evils,
                  bless these children ! And let them be called by my name and
                  by the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaak ; and may they
                   be increased to a great multitude on the earth
            17           Nowwhen Joseph saw that his father put his right hand on
                   Ephraim's head, it appeared amiss to him ; and he took hold
                   of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to the
            18 head of Manasses.                         And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my
                   father : for this is the first born, put thy right hand on his head.
            19 But he refused and said, I know ; my son ; I know.                                                           This in-
                   deed will be a people and will be exalted.                                        Buthis younger bro-
                   ther will be greater than he ; and his seed will be a multitude of
            20 nations.               And he blessed them that day and said, By you Israel
                   will bless saying, God make thee like Ephraim and Manasses.
            21 So he put Ephraim before Manasses.                                              Then Israel said to Jo-

     28     All these were the twelve sons of Jacob.        And these were
         the words which their father spoke to them when he blessed
     29 them, each according to his peculiar blessing.        And when he
         had blessed them he said, I am going to be added to my peo-
     30 pie, and you shall bury me with my fathers, in the cave which
         is in the field of Ephron the Chettite, in the double cave which
         is over against Mambre in the land of Chanaanâ€”the cave
     31 which Abraham bought of Ephron the Chettite for the posses-
         sion of a burying place.     There they buried Abraham and Sa-
     32 rah his wife.   There they buried Isaak and Kebekka his wife.
         There Leia was buriedâ€”in the field namely in the cave in it,
     33 which was purchased of the children of Chet.          And when Ja-
         cob had finished this charge to his sons he drew up his feet into
         the bed and gave up the ghost and was added to his people.
     L.     Then Joseph fell upon his father's face and bewailed him
      2 and kissed him.      And Joseph gave orders to his servants the
      3 embalmers to embalm his father.          And when the embalmers
         had embalmed Israel, and compleated his forty days ; (for this
         is the time allowed for embalming) the Egyptians mourned
      4 for him seventy days.      And when the days of mourning were
         over, Joseph spoke to the princes of Pharao saying, If I have
         found favour in your sight, speak for me to Pharao and say,
      5 My father adjured me saying, In the tomb which I cut out for
         myself in the land of Chanaan there thou shalt bury me.         Now
         therefore let me go up and bury my father and I will return
      6 again.   And Pharao said to Joseph, Co up and bury thy father
      7 as he adjured thee.     So Joseph went up to bury his father. And
         there went up with him all the servants of Pharao and the elders
         of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, and all
       Cli. L.                      GENESIS.
           Joseph's family and his brothers and all his lather's household
        8 and his kindred.    But their flocks and herds they left in the
        9 land of Gesem.      There went up also with him chariots and
       10 horsemen, so that the camp was very large.        And when they
          came to the threshing floor of Atacl, which is on the bank
          of the Jordan, they mourned for him with a very great and
          sore lamentation.   And he continued the mourning for hisfather
       11 seven days.   And when the inhabitants of the land of Chanaan
          saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said,
          This is a great grief to the Egyptians.   For this cause they call-
          ed its name Grief of Egypt.    It is on the bank of the Jordan.
       12     When his sons had done this for himâ€”when they had car-
          ried him to the land of Chanaan and buried him in the double
       13 caveâ€”the cave which Abraham bought for the possession of a
       14 burying place from Ephron the Chettite over against Mambre,
          then Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren and those
          who went up with him to bury his father.
       15     Now when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead,
          they said, Perhaps Joseph may bear us a grudge and requite
       16 us for all the ills which we have done to him.    So they came to
          Joseph and said, Our father before he died adjured us saying,
       17 Thus shall you say to Joseph, Forgive them their iniquity and
          their sin for having done thee evil.   Now therefore forgive the
       18 iniquity of the servants of the God of thy father.      And while
          they were speaking to him, Joseph wept.      And they came near
          to him and said, We are thy servants, upon which Joseph said
       19 to them, Fear not, for I am God's servant.       You indeed con-
       20 suited against me for evil : but God determined concerning
          me for good, to bring to pass as at this day, that much people
       21 might be nourished.    Moreover he said to them, Be not afraid.
          I will continue to nourish you and your families.      So he com-
       22 forted them, and spoke affectionately to them,        xind Joseph
          dwelt in Egypt, he and his brothers and all his father's family.
       23 And when Joseph had lived a hundred and ten years and saw
          Ephraim's children to the third generation ; and the children
          of Machir the son of Manasses were also dandled on his knees ;
       24 Joseph spoke to his brothers, saying, I die, but God will
          assuredly visit you and conduct you out of this land into the
          land which God with an oath gave to our fathers, Abraham,
     Ch. L.                          GENESIS.
     25 Isaak and Jacob.       And Joseph adjured the children of Israel
         saying, In the visitation wherewith G-od will visit you, you shall
     26 carry my bones hence with you.          So Joseph died being a hun-
         dred and ten years old, and when they had embalmed him they
         put him into a coffin in Egypt.
                                     EXODUS.
     I.        These are the names of Israel's sons who went down to
         Egypt with their father Jacob.        They went every one with his
         whole family ; Reuben, Symeon, Levi, Judas, Issachar, Zabu-
       5 Ion, Benjamin, Dan and Nephthaleim, Gad and Aser.                  Now
         Joseph was in Egypt.       And all the souls from Jacob were seven-
       6 ty five.   And when Joseph was dead and all his brothers and all
       7 that generation and the children of Israel had increased and
         multiplied and were become numerous and grew more and
       8 more powerful and the land caused them to abound, there
       9 arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.             And he
         said to his nation, Behold the race of the children of Israel is
     10 become a great multitude, and is mightier than we.                 Come
         therefore, let us deal subtilly with them.        Perhaps when they
         are multiplied, if a war should happen to us, they will join
         our enemies and fight against us and depart out of the land.
     11 So he set task masters over them to afflict them with labours and
         they built for Pharao fortified cities, namely, Peitho and Rames-
     12 ses and On, which is Heliopolis.     Butthe more they afflicted them,
         the more they multiplied and grew stronger and stronger.              So
     13 the Egyptians were abhorred by the children of Israel; and
         the Egyptians ruled over the Israelites with rigour and made
         their lives bitter with hard labour in working clay and making
     14 bricks and with all the toils of the field, according to the seve-
         ral kinds of service to which they forcibly subjected them.
     15 Moreover the king of the Egyptians spoke to the Hebrew
         midwives, of whom the name of the first in rank was Sep-
     16 phora and the name of the second Phua, and said, When you
         do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women and they are
         delivered, if it be a male child, kill it ; but if it be a female pre-
     17 serve it alive.   But the midwives feared God and did not do as
         the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the males.

        Oh. EI.                        EXODUS.
        IS Whereupon the king of Egypt sent for the midwives and said
           to them, AVhy have you done this and saved the male chil-
        19 dren ?   And the midwives said to Pharao, The Hebrew women
           are not like the Egyptian ; for they bring forth instantly.      Be-
       20 fore the midwives can come to them, they are delivered.          And
           God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied
       21 and grew mighty.      And because the midwives feared God they
       22 established families for themselves.      Then Pharao gave orders
           to all his people saying, Every male child which is born to the
           Hebrews you shall throw into the river, but preserve every fe-
           male alive.
       II.     Now there was a certain man of the tribe of Levi who had
           married one of the daughters of Levi and she conceived and
         2 bore a son.   And when they saw that he was a beautiful child
        3 they hid him three months.        But when they could not conceal
           him any longer, his mother provided for him a wicker basket
           and plaistered it with bitumenous pitch and put the child into
           it and placed it in the stagnant water by the side of the river.
        4 And his sister watched it at a distance to see what would be-
        5 come of it.     And the daughter of Pharao came to bathe her-
           self at the river and her maids were walking with her along the
           bank.   And seeing the basket in the stagnant water she sent
        6 her maid and had it brought to her.        And upon opening it she
           saw in the basket a child weeping.      And the daughter of Pha-
           rao had compassion on it and said, This is one of the Hebrew
        7 children.    Whereupon his sister said to Pharao's daughter,
           Shall I call for thee a nurse from among the Hebrews to suckle
           the child for thee ?     And the daughter of Pharao said, Go.
        8 Upon which the girl went and called the child's mother.          And
        9 the daughter of Pharao said to her, Take care of this child for
       10 me and suckle it for me ; and I will pay thee the wages.       So the
           woman took the child and suckled it ; and when the boy was
           grown up she brought him to Pharao's daughter and he be-
           came her son.    And she called his name Moses, saying, I drew
           him out of the water.
       11      And after a course of many years, when Moses was become
           great he went out to his brethren the children of Israel.    And as
           he was observing their distress, he saw an Egyptian beating a
           Hebrew, who was one of his brethren the children of Israel.
     Ch. III.                   EXODUS.
     12 Whereupon looking about on every side and seeing no body
     13 he smote the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.    And going
        out the next day he saw two Hebrew men quarrelling and said
     14 to him who was in the wrong, Why dost thou beat thy neigh-
        bour ?  To which he replied, Who made thee a ruler or a judge
        over us ? Dostthou mean to kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian
        yesterday ? Thereupon Moses was alarmed and said, Is the
        thing become so public ?
     15    Now when Pharao heard of this deed he sought to slay
        Moses, but he withdrew from the presence of Pharao and took
     1G up his abode in the land of Madiam.   When he came to the
        land of Madiam he sat down by a well.  Now the priest of Ma-
        diam had seven daughters who tended the flocks of their fa-
        ther Jothor.  And they having come to the well began to
        draw water to fill the troughs that they might water the flocks
        of their father Jothor, and the shepherds came and drove them
     17 away.  Upon which Moses arose and protected them and drew
     18 water for them and watered their flocks.And when they came
        to their father Eaguel, he said to them, Why have you come
     19 so soon to-day ? To which they replied, An Egyptian protect-
        ed us from the shepherds and drew for us and watered our
     20 flocks. And he said to his daughters, And where is he ?Why
        did you leave the man behiud ? Therefore call him that he may
     21 eat bread.  So Moses dwelt with the man; and he gave him
     22 his daughter Sepphora to be his wife. And his wife conceived
        and bore him a son ; And Moses called his name Gersam, say-
        ing, Because I am a sojourner in a strange land.
     2o    And after those many years the king of Egypt died and the
        Israelites groaned under their labours and raised a loud out-
        cry ; and their cry on account of their labours ascended up to
     24 God.  And God heard their groans.     And God remembered
        his covenant which he had made with Abraham, Isaak and
        Jacob.  And God looked upon the Israelites and was made
        known to them.
     III.   Now when Moses was feeding the flocks of Jothor his
        father in law the priest of Madiam he led them below the wil-
      2 derness and came to the mountain Choreb.   And an Angel of
        the Lord appeared to him in a fire blazing out of a bush.And
        when he saw that the bush blazed with fire, but was not con-
                                                                                                                                                                                                ;
                 Ch. III.                                                                    EXODUS.
                    3 sinned, Moses said, I will go near aiid see this great sight
                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;
                    4 why the bush is not consumed.                                                                 But when the Lord saw that
                          he drew near to look ; the Lord called to him out of the bush
                          saying, Moses ! Moses !                                            And he said, What is it ?                                                       And he
                    5 said, Approach not hither.                                                       Loose the sandals from thy feet
                    6 for the place where thou standest is holy ground.                                                                                                    Then he
                          said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, and
                    7 the God of Isaak, and the God of Jacob.                                                                                    Whereupon Moses
                          turned away his face ; for he was afraid to look forward in the
                          presence of God.                                  And the Lord said to Moses, I have indeed
                          seen the affliction of my people in Egypt and have heard their
                    8 cry on the account of their task masters ; for I know their sorrow,
                                                                                           r
                          therefore I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of
                          the Egyptians and to bring them out of that land, and conduct
                          them to a land good and spaciousâ€”to a land flowing with milk
                          and honeyâ€”to the country of the Chananites and the Chettites
                          and the Amorites, and the Pherezites, and the Gergasites and
                    9 the Evites and the Jebusites.                                                          And now behold the cry of the
                          children of Israel hath reached me and I have seen the oppres-
                          sion with which the Egyptians oppress them, now therefore
                 10 come : I will send thee to Pharao king of Egypt and thou shalt
                 11 bring my people the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.                                                                                                     There-
                          upon Moses said to God, Who am I that I should go to Pharao
                          king of Egypt, and that I should bring the Israelites out of the
                 12 land of Egypt?                                          Upon which God spoke to Moses saying,
                          That I will be with thee, even this is the sign for thee.                                                                                                   And
                          because I will send thee, therefore when thou hast brought my
                          people out of Egypt you shall worship God on this mountain.
                 13 Then Moses said to God, Behold when I come to the Israel-
                          ites and say to them, The God of our fathers hath sent me
                          to you ; and they shall say, What is his name ?                                                                                       What shall I
                 14 say to them ?                                   On which God spoke to Moses saying, I am The
                          I Am.                  Moreover he said, Thus shalt thou say to the children
                 15 of Israel, The I Am hath sent me to you.                                                                                     Again God said to
                          Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, The Lord,
                          the God of our fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of
                          Isaak, and the God of Jacob hath sent me to you.                                                                                             This is my
                  16 everlasting name and memorial to all generations.                                                                                                   Go there-
                          fore and assemble the Senate of the children of Israel and say
                  IV.                                         EXODUS.
         Oh.
               to them, The Lord, the (rod of our fathers hath appeared to
               rne, even the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaak, and the
               God of Jacob saying, With watchfulness I have observed you
         17 and all that hath befallen you in Egypt.                                              Moreover he said, 1
               will bring you up from the oppression of the Egyptians to the
               land of the Chananites and the Chettites and the Amorites and
               the Pherezites, and the Gergasites and the Evites and the Je-
               busitesâ€”to a land flowing with milk and honey, and they will
         18 hearken to thy voice, and thou and the Senate of Israel shall
               go to Pharao king of Egypt, and thou shalt say to him, The
               God of the Hebrews hath called us'; let us therefore go three
               days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to our
         1!)   God.         But I know that Pharao king of Egypt will not suffer
         20 you to go, but by a strong hand.                                    Therefore I will stretch forth
               my hand and smite the Egyptians with all my wonders which
                I  will do anions them.                          And after these he will dismiss you.
         21 And I will give the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians,
               so that when you go, you shall not go away empty ; but every
         22 woman shall ask of her neighbour and of him who sojourneth
                in her house vessels of silver and of gold, and raiment which
               you shall put on your sons and your daughters and you shall
         IV.            spoil the Egyptians.                         Then Moses answered and said, If
               they will not believe and hearken to my voiceâ€”for they may
               say, God hath not appeared to thee : What shall I say to them ?
           2 And the Lord said to him, What is that in thy hand ?                                                         And he
           3 said a staff.              Then he said, Cast it on the ground.                                     So he cast it
               on the ground and it became a serpent : and 3loses fled from
           4 it.        Then the Lord said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand and
               take it by the tail.                   So he stretched forth his hand and caught it
            5 by the tail ; and it was in his hand a staff.                                          That they may be-
                lieve thee that the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and
                the God of Isaak, and the God of Jacob hath appeared to thee,
           6 said the Lord again, Put thy hand in thy bosom.                                                   So he put his
                hand in his bosom ; and when he drew his hand out of his bo-
           7 som, his hand was like snow.                                Then the Lord said to him again,
                Put thy hand in thy bosom.                              So he put his hand in his bosom,
                and when he drew it out of his bosom, it was again restored
            8 to the colour of its ilesh.                                   Now if they will not believe
                thee nor hearken to the voice of the first sign, they will be-
                                                                          â€”
       Ch. IV.                      EXODUS.
        9 lieve thee at the voice of the second sign.      But if they will
           not believe thee for these two signs, nor hearken to thy voice,
           thou shalt take some of the water of the river and pour it
           out on the dry ground ; and the water which thou shalt take
       10 from the river shall be blood on the ground.          Then Moses
           said to the Lord,       Lord, I am not sufficiently qualified,
           neither heretofore nor since thou hast begun to speak to thy
           servant.  I have a stammering voice and a faltering tongue.
       11 Upon which the Lord said to Moses, Who gave man a
           mouth? and who made the hard of hearing and the deaf
       12 him who seeth and the blind ?    Was it not I who am God ?    Now
           therefore go and I will open thy mouth and teach thee what
       13 thou shalt say.     Then Moses said,       Lord, provide another
       14 capable person whom thou wilt send.      Whereupon the anger of
           the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said, Lo ! is not
           Aaron the Levite thy brother ?    I know that he can speak well
           for thee.  And lo ! he will come out to meet thee, and when
       15 he shall see thee he will be rejoiced.      Thou therefore shalt
           speak to him and commit my words to his mouth.        And I will
           open thy mouth and his mouth and teach you what you shall
       1G do.   He shall speak to the people for thee and he shall be thy
       17 mouth and thou shalt be to him as the Oracle of God.          And
           this staff which was turned into a serpent thou shalt take in thy
           hand.   With it thou shalt perform miracles.
       18     Then Moses went and returned to Jothor his father in law
           and said, I must go and return to my brethren who are in
       19 Egypt and see if they be still living.    And Jothor said to Mo-
           ses, Go in peace.  So after many years, when the king of Egypt
           was dead, and the Lord said to Moses in Madiam, Go return
       20 to Egypt, for all who sought thy life are dead; Moses took
           his wife and children and mounted them on asses to return
           to Egypt.   And he took in his hand the staff which he had
       21 from God.     And the Lord said to Moses, Thou art on thy
           way and returning to Egypt.     See that thou do in the sight of
           Pharao all the miracles which I put in thy hands.     And I will
           make his heart stubborn, so that he will not let the people go.
       22 And thou shalt say to Pharao, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is
       23 my first born son, and I have said to thee, Send away this my
           people that they may serve me ; if therefore thou wilt not dis-
           miss them behold I will slay thy sonâ€”thy first born.
                                                                                                                         ;
        Ch. V.                                          EXODUS.
        24         Now when he was on the way at the resting place, an
        25 Angel of the Lord met him and sought to kill him.                                                 Where-
             upon Sepphora took a sharp stone and circumcised her son.
              Then she fell at his feet and said, The blood of the circumci-
        26. sion of my son hath stopped me.                                 So she departed from him>
              because she said, The blood of the circumcision of my son
              hath stopt me.
        27         Now the Lord had said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness
              to meet Moses.              So he went and met him at the mount of God
        28 and they saluted each other.                             And Moses told Aaron all the
             words of the Lord, which he had sent and all the orders which
        29 he had given him in charge.                            And Moses and Aaron went and
        30 assembled the Senate of the Israelites, and Aaron rehearsed
             all the words which God had spoken to Moses ; and he per-
        31 formed the miracles in the presence of the people.                                               And the
              people believed and were rejoiced that God had visited the
              children of Israel and that he had seen their affliction.                                               So
             bowing their heads the people worshipped.
        V.         And after this Moses went in with Aaron to Pharao and
             they said to him, Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, Let
             my people go that they may keep a festival for me in the wil-
          2 derness.           Upon which Pharao said, Who is he, that I should
          3 hearken to his voice so as to send away the Israelites ? I do
             not know the Lord, nor will I let Israel go.                                       Then they said
             to him, The God of the Hebrews hath called us.                                                   Let us
             therefore go three days' journey into the wilderness that we
              may sacrifice to the Lord our God, lest death or destruction
          4 befal us.           Thereupon the king of Egypt said to them, Why
              do ye, Moses and Aaron, divert the people from their labours ?
          5 Begone each of you to his work.                                  And Pharao said, Behold
             this people is now numerous, therefore we must not let them
          6 rest from their labours.                        So Pharao gave orders to the task
          7 masters of the people and to the clerks saying, You shall no
              more give the people straw to make bricks as heretofore; but
              let them go and gather straw for themselves ; yet the daily
          8 task of brick making which they now perform, you shall lay
              upon them.             Thou shalt make no abatement ; for they are idle.
              Therefore they have cried saying, Let us go and sacrifice to
          9 our God.             Let the work of these men be made heavy and let
          VI.                EXODUS.
      Oh.
         them employ their thoughts about that, and not trouble them-
      10 selves with vain discourses.Upon this the task masters and
      11 clerks hurried them and spoke to the people saying, Thus saith
         Pharao, I will no more give you straw ; go and collect straw for
         yourselves where you can find it; for no abatement shall be
      12 made of your task.So the people were dispersed through all
      13 the land of Egypt to collect stubble instead of straw.And the
         task masters urged them saying, Compleat the customary daily
      14 task as when straw was furnished you.And when they beat
         the clerks of the nation of the Israelites who were set over them
         by the officers of Pharao and said, Why have you not as hereto-
      15 fore compleated your tasks ofbrick making to day? the clerks of
         the children of Israel went and cried to Pharao saying, Why dost
      16 thou deal thus with thy servants ?There is no straw given to
         thy servants, yet they say to us, Make bricks.And lo ! thy
         servants are beaten.Wilt thou then deal unjustly with thy
      17 people ?But he said to them, You are idle : You are idlers.
      18 Therefore you say, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.Go
         therefore now and work ; for there shall be no straw given
      19 you, yet you shall deliver the task of bricks.So the clerks of
        the children of Israel saw themselves in a miserable situation,
         when they said, You shall be allowed no abatement from the
      20 customary daily task of brick making.And upon meeting
         Moses and Aaron who had come to meet them as they came
      21 out from Pharao they said to them, God look upon you and
        judge. Eor you have made the smell of us horrible before Pha-
         rao and before his servants to put a sword in his hand to
      22 kill us.Thereupon Moses turned to the Lord and said,
         Lord, why hast thou afflicted this people ? And why hast thou
         sent me ?For since I went to Pharao to speak in thy name,
         he hath ill treated this peoj>le and thou hast not delivered thy
      VI.   people. Then the Lord said to Moses, Now thou shalt see
         what I will do to Pharao ; for by a strong hand he shall let them
         go ; and by an uplifted arm he shall drive them out of his land.
       2 Moreover God spake to Moses and said to him, I am the Lord ;
       3 and I appeared to Abraham and to Isaak and to Jacob as their
         God. Though I did not clearly manifest to them my name
       4 Lord, yet I established this my covenant with them to give
         them the land of the Chananitesâ€”the land wherein they had
    Ch. VI.                     EXODUS.
     5 sojournedâ€”in which they were then sojourning.    Now I have
       heard the groaning of the children of Israel, which the Egyp-
     6 tians have occasioned by enslaving them. And I have remem-
       bered the covenant with you.  Go speak to the children of Is-
        rael and say, I am the Lord and I will bring you out from the
        bondage of the Egyptians, and deliver you from this slavery, and
        redeem you with an uplifted arm and with great decision and
        take you to myself for my own people, and I will be your God.
     7 And you shall know that I the Lord am your God, who brought
     8 you out from the tyranny of the Egyptians.   And I will bring
        you to the land for which I stretched out my hand to give it
        to Abraham and Isaak and Jacob.    And I will give it to you
        for a heritage.I am the Lord.
     9     In these terms Moses spoke to the Israelites ; but they heark-
        ened not to him on account of their despondency, and on ac-
    10 count of their hard labours.  Then the Lord spoke to Moses
    11 saying ; Go in ; speak to Pharao king of Egypt that he may
     12 send the children of Israel out of his land.Upon which Mo-
        ses spoke before the Lord saying, Behold the Israelites have
        not hearkened to me, how then should Pharao hearken to me,
        incapable as I am of speaking ?
     13    (Now when the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave
        them a charge to Pharao king of Egypt to send away the Is-
        raelites out of the land of Egypt, these were the chief lead-
     14 ers of their patriarchal houses.The sons of Eeuben the first
        born of Israel, Enoch and Phallus, Asron and Carmi.     This
     15 was the family of Reuben.    And the sons of Symeon were
        Jemuel and Jamin and Aocl and Jachin and Saar and Saul the
     16 son of a Chananitish woman.      These were the patriarchal
        houses of the Symeonites.  And these are the names of the
        children of Levi according to their families, Gerson, Kaath
        and Merari.  Now the years of the life of Levi were a hun-
     17 dred and thirty seven.  And these were the sons of Gerson,
        Lobeni and Semei.    These were houses of their patriarchal
     18 family.  And the sons of Kaath were Ambram and Issaar, Che-
        bron and Oziel.  Now the years of the life of Kaath were a
     19 hundred and thirty three.  And the sons of Merari were Mooli
        and Mousi.   These were the houses of the patriarchal family of
     20 Levi according to their families.Now Ambram had taken to
           VOL. I.                  N
       Ch. VII.                    EXODUS.
          wife Jocliabed a daughter of his father's brother and she bore to
          him Aaron and Moses and Mariam their sister.    And the years
       21 of the life of Ambrani were a hundred and thirty two.     And
       22 the sons of Issaar were Kore and Naphek and Zechri.       And
       23 the sons of Oziel were Misael and Elisaphan and Segri.    And
          Aaron had taken to wife Elizabeth the daughter of Aminadab
          and the sister of Naason, and she bore to him Nadab and
       24 Abiud and Eleazar and Ithamar.     And the sons of Kore were
          Asir and Elkana and Abiasar.      These were the families of
       25 Kore.   And Eleazar the son of Aaron had taken to wife one
          of the daughters of Phoutiel, and she bore to him Phineas.
          These were the heads of the patriarchal family of the Levites
       26 according to their genealogies.  This Aaron and Moses were
          they whom God ordered to lead the Israelites out of the land
          of Egypt with their armies.    These were they who spoke to
       27 Pharao king of Egypt,    xlnd the same Aaron and Moses led
          the Israelites out of Egypt.
       28    Now on the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in the
          land of Egypt, when the Lord spoke to Moses and said, I
          am the Lord, Speak to Pharao king of Egypt all the words
          which I say to thee, and Moses said before the Lord, Be-
          hold I am a stammerer and how will Pharao listen to me, the
       VII.     Lord spoke to Moses saying, Behold I have made thee
          a god to Pharao, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet,
        2 and thou shalt deliver to him all that I command thee.    And
          Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharao, to send the Israelites
        3 out of his land. But I will let Pharao's heart be stubborn, and
          I will multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
        4 And when Pharao will not hearken to you, I will lay my hand
          upon Egypt and bring out my people, the children of Israel
          with my host out of the land of Egypt with great vengeance.
        5 And all the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I
          lay my hand on Egypt and bring the children of Israel out
        6 from among them.    So Moses acted in conjunction with Aaron ;
        7 and as the Lord commanded so they did.        Now Moses was
        8 eighty years old and his brother Aaron was eighty three years
          old, when he spoke to Pharao.)
        9    And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron saying, If Pha-
          rao shall speak to you and say, Give us a sign or a miracle,
      Oh. VII.                    EXODUS.
         then thou shalt say to thy brother Aaron, Take this staff and
         throw it on the ground in the presence of Pharao and before
      10 his attendants and it shall be a dragon. So Moses went in with
         Aaron before Pharao and his attendants and they did as the
         Lord commanded them.      But when Aaron threw down the staff
         before Pharao and before his attendants and it became a dra-
         gon, Pharao called together the wise men of Egypt and the
     11 sorcerers.  And the Egyptian enchanters by their sorceries did
         in like manner.   They cast down each his staff, which became
      12 dragons.  Though Aaron's staff devoured their staves, yet Pha-
      13 rao's heart was stubborn and he hearkened not to them to do
         as the Lord cooimanded them.
     11     Then the Lord said to Moses, Pharao's heart is obstinate-
         ly bent not to let the people go. Go in the morning to Pharao.
     15 Behold he is going out to the water and thou wilt meet him at
         the border of the river. And thou shalt take in thy hand the
     16 staff which was turned into a serpent, and say to him, The
         Lord the God of the Hebrews hath sent to thee saying, Send
         away my people that they may serve me in the wilderness, and
     17 behold thou hast not hearkened hitherto.   Thus saith the Lord,
         Bythis thou shalt know that I am the Lord, Behold with this staff
         which is in my hand I smite upon the water in the river
     18 and it shall turn into blood.   And the fishes which are in the
         river shall die.And the river shall stink.  And the Egyptians
     19 shall not be able to drink the water of the river. Moreover the
         Lord said to Moses, Say to thy brother Aaron, Take thy staff
         in thy hand and stretch forth thy hand against the waters of
         Egypt, against the rivers and against the canals and against
        their ponds and against all their reservoirs of water ; and they
         shall become blood, and there shall be blood throughout all
        the land of Egypt both in the cisterns of wood and in those
         of stone.
     20     So Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them.
        And lifting up his staff he smote the water in the river in the
        presence of Pharao and before all his attendants and changed
         all the water of the river into blood.And the fishes which were
     21 in the river died.  And the river stunk so that the Egyptians
         could not drink the water of the river.   And there was blood
     22 in all the land of Egypt.    But when the magicians of Egypt
             Ch. VIII.                                          EXODUS.
                   did in like manner by their enchantments, Pharao's heart be-
                   came inflexible so that he hearkened not to them as the Lord
            23 had said.                 So Pharao returned and went to his house and paid
            24 no attention to this.                          And all the Egyptians dug round about
                   the river for water to drink for they could not drink the water
                   of the river.
            25            And when the seven days were fulfilled after the Lord had
                   smitten the river, the Lord said to Moses, Go to Pharao and
            VIII.              say to him, Thus saith the Lord, Send away my peo-
              2 pie that they may serve me.                                  But if thou wilt not let them go,
                   behold I will smite all thy borders with frogs and the river shall
              3 swarm with frogs.                         And they shall go up and come into thy
                   houses and into thy bed chambers, even upon thy beds ; and
                   into the houses of thy servants and thy people and into thy
              4 kneading troughs and thy ovens.                                     Both against thee and against
               .*> thy attendants and thy people shall the frogs come up.                                                   And the
                   Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron thy brother, Stretch forth
                   the staff with thy hand over the rivers and over the canals and
               6 over the lakes and bring up the frogs.                                               So Aaron stretched
                   forth his hand over the waters of Egypt and brought up the
                   frogs.         And frogs came up in abundance and covered the land
               7 -of Egypt.               Though the Egyptian sorcerers did in like man-
                   ner by their enchantments and brought up frogs on the land
               8 of Egypt ; yet Pharao called Moses and Aaron and said, Pray
                   for me to the Lord, and let him take away the frogs from me
                   and my people ; and I will let them go that they may sacrifice
               9 to the Lord.                  Whereupon Moses said to Pharao, Set me the
                   time when I shall pray for thee and for thy attendants and thy
                   people, that the frogs may vanish from thee and from thy peo-
             10 pie and out of your houses and be left only in the river.                                                           And
                   he said against to-morrow.                            And Moses said, It shall be as thou
                   hast spoken.                That thou mayst know that there is no other
             11 besides the Lord ; the frogs shall be removed from thee and
                   from your houses and from your villages and from all thy at-
                   tendants and from thy people ; but in the river they shall be
             12 left.           Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharao ; and
                   Moses cried to the Lord for the performance of the promise
             13 touching the frogs as Pharao had stated.                                                And the Lord did
                   as Moses said.                  The frogs died out of the houses and out of
         VIII.                 EXODUS.
     Ch.
     14 the villages and out of the fields. And they collected them
        in heaps and the land stank.
     15    But when Pharao saw that there was a respite, his heart
        became stubborn and he hearkened not to them as the Lord
    16 had said.   Then the Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron,
        Stretch forth thy staff with thy hand and smite the dust of the
        ground, and there shall be stinging gnats among the men and
    17 the four footed beasts throughout all the land of Egypt. Ac-
        cordingly Aaron stretched forth the staff with his hand and
        smote the dust of the ground, and there were stinging gnats
        among the men and among the four footed beasts, and in all the
    18 dust of the ground there were gnats.   As the magicians did
        in like manner by their enchantments to remove the stinging
        gnats but could not, so the stinging gnats were among the
    19 men and among the four footed beasts.   Therefore the sorcer-
        ers said to Pharao, This is the finger of (rod.But Pharao's
        heart was inflexible and he hearkened not to them as the Lord
        had said.
    20     Then the Lord said to Moses, Bise early to-morrow and
        stand before Pharao. Lo ! he will come forth to the water, and
        thou shalt say to him, Thus saith the Lord, Send away my
    21 people that they may serve me in the wilderness.  But if thou
        wilt not send away my people behold I will send against thee
       and against thy attendants and against thy people and against
       your houses, the dog fly.  And the houses of the Egyptians
        shall be filled with dog flies throughout all the land in which
    22 they are.  But in that day I will distinguish in a glorious manner
        the land of Gesem in which my people are.   In it there shall
        be no dog flies, that thou mayst know that I am the Lord the
    23 God of the whole earth.    And I will make a difference be-
        tween my people and thy people.    To-morrow this shall be
    24 in the land.  And the Lord did so.   And there came a swarm
       of dog flies into the houses of Pharao and into the houses of
        his attendants and into all the land of Egypt : and the land
    25 was utterly wasted by them.      Whereupon Pharao sent for
       Moses and Aaron and said, Go and sacrifice to the Lord your
    26 God in this land.  And Moses said, It is not possible to do so.
        For we shall sacrifice to the Lord our God the abominations
        of the Egyptians. Now if we should sacrifice the abomina-
                                                                                                                                    ;
            Ch. IX.                                             EXODUS.
                  tions of the Egyptians before their faces we shall be stoned.
            27 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness and sacri-
            28 flee to our God, as the Lord hath commanded us.                                                     Then Pha-
                  rao said, I give you leave to go, that you may sacrifice to
                  your God in the wilderness ; but you must not extend your
                  journey to a great distance.                                Therefore pray to the Lord
            29 for me.              And Moses said I will go out from thee and pray
                  to God; and the dog flies shall depart from thy servants
                  and from thy people to-morrow.                                      But let not Pharao deal
                  deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacri-
            30 flee to the Lord.                     So Moses went out from Pharao and prayed
            31 to God.               And the Lord did as Moses said and removed the
                  dog flies from Pharao and his attendants and his people and
            32 there was not one left.                           But Pharao emboldened his heart at
                  this time also and would not let the people go.
            IX.            Then the Lord said to Moses, Go to Pharao and say to
                  him, Thus saith the Lord the God of the Hebrews, Send away
              2 my people that they may serve me.                                       For if thou wilt not send
              3 away my people but still detain them, behold the hand of the
                  Lord will be upon thy cattle in the field : and among the
                  horses and among the asses and the camels and the herds and
              â€¢i  the flocks there shall be a grievous pestilence.                                      And at this time
                  also I will make a remarkable distinction between the cattle of
                  the Egyptians and the cattle of the Israelites.                                               Among the
              5 aforementioned belonging to Israel not one shall die.                                                        And
                  God fixed a set time saying, To-morrow the Lord will do this
              6 in the land.               So on the morrow the Lord executed this, and all
                  the cattle which died belonged to the Egyptians; but of the
              7 cattle belonging to the Israelites not one died.                                                But though
                  Pharao saw that of all the cattle belonging to the Israelites not
                  one died, his heart was inflexible and he would not let the
                  people go.
              8         Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron saying, Take
                  handfuls of ashes from the furnace ; and let Moses scatter them
                  towards heaven in the presence of Pharao and before his at-
              9 tendants and let there be dust on all the land of Egypt, and
                  there shall be on men and four footed beasts an inflammation
                  blains oozing forth both on man and beast in all the land of
            10 Egypt.             So Moses took the ashes of a furnace in the sight of
                                                                   â€”
    Ch. IX.                     EXODUS.
        Pharao and scattered them towards heaven, and there was an
    11 inflammation with oozing blains both on man and beast, so
        that the sorcerers could not stand before Mioses, because of
        these boils. For the boils were on the sorcerers and throusrh-
    12 out all the land of Egypt.  But the Lord made Pharao's heart
        stubborn and he hearkened not to them as the Lord com-
       manded.
    13     Then the Lord said to Moses, Rise early to-morrow morn-
        ing and stand before Pharao and say to him, Thus saith the
        Lord the God of the Hebrews, Send away my people that they
    14 may serve me.     For at this time I am going to send all my
        plagues into thy heart and the heart of thy servants and thy
        people, that thou mayst know that there is none like me in all
    15 the earth.  I might now indeed have stretched forth my hand
        and smitten thee and destroyed thy people with pestilence, so
    16 that thou shouldst have been blotted out from the earth : but
        thou hast been preserved for this purpose that by thee I might
        display my power and that my name may be celebrated
    17 throughout all the earth.   Shouldst thou therefore still deter-
    18 mine with respect to my people not to let them go, behold at
       this time to-morrow I will pour down a great storm of hail
        such as hath never been in Egypt, from the day it was created
    19 even to this day.  Now therefore haste and gather in thy cattle
        and whatever thou hast in the field.For every man and beast,
        which shall be found in the fields and shall not have come
        home, on them the hail shall fall and they shall die.
    20     Such of the attendants of Pharao as feared the Lord gather-
    21 ed their cattle into houses. But such as paid no regard to the
    22 word of the Lord left their cattle in the fields.Then the Lord
        said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven, and
        there shall be hail on all the land of Egypt, both on man and
    23 beast and on every herb which is on the ground.    And Moses
        stretched forth his hand towards heaven and the Lord sent
        thunder and hail, and the fire streamed along the ground.And
        the Lord poured down a storm of hail on all the land of
    24 Egypt.   And there was hail, with flaming fire among the hail.
        And the hail storm was excessively great such as had never
    25 been in Egypt from the day there was a nation in it.      And
        throughout all the land of Egypt the hail smote both man and
                                                                                                                   ;
                  X.                                    EXODUS.
            Ch.
                 beast.      The hail also smote every herb of the field and broke
           26 to pieces all the trees in the fields.                        But in the land of Gesern
           27 where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.                                          Then
                 Pharao sent for Moses and Aaron and said to them, I have
           28 sinned this time.                The Lord is righteous ; but as for me and
                 my people, we are wicked.                        Pray therefore for me to the
                 Lord; and let the voices of God and the hail and fire cease
           29 and I will send you away and you shall stay no longer.                                          And
                Moses said to him, As soon as I have gone out of the city I
                will spread out my hands to the Lord and the voices will cease
                and there will be no more hail and rain, that thou mayst know
           30 that the earth is the Lord's.                       But as for thee and thy attend-
                ants I know that you do not yet fear the Lord.
           31         Now the flax and the barley were smitten, for the barley
           32 had eared and the flax was in seed.                           But the wheat and spelts
                were not smitten for they had been lately sown.
           33         So Moses went out from Pharao without the city and
                stretched forth his hands to the Lord.                         And the thunder ceased
                and the hail and the rain no longer poured down on the earth.
           34 And when Pharao saw that the rain and the hail and the thun-
                der were stayed he continued on in his course of sinning and
                hardened his own heart and the hearts of his servants.
           25         And when Pharao's heart was inflexible and he would not
                let the people go as the Lord had said to Moses, then the Lord
           X. spake to Moses saying, Go to Pharao, for I have suffered the
                heart of him and his attendants to continue stubborn that these
            2 my signs might come upon them in succession, that you may
                tell in the hearing of your children even to your children's
                children, with what contempt I have treated the Egyptians,
                even these my signs which I have done among them, and you
                will know that I am the Lord.
            3        Then Moses and Aaron went in before Pharao and said
                to him, Thus saith the Lord the God of the Hebrews.                                          How
            4 long wilt thou refuse to reverence me ?                             Send away my people
                that they may serve me.                    Otherwise, if thou refuse to let my
            5 people go, behold at this time to-morrow I will bring a swarm
                of locusts on all thy borders and they shall cover the face of
                the ground, so that thou shalt not be able to see the ground
                and they shall devour all the remaining product of the land
         3
        Ch. X.                              EXODUS.
            which the hail hath left you ; and they shall devour every tree
         (I  which groweth for you in the land.               And thy houses and the
            houses of thy servants, all the houses of the Egyptians through-
            out the whole land, shall be filled in such a manner as thy fa-
            thers and their forefathers never saw from the time they had
            an existence in the land even to this day.                 And Moses turned
            and went out from Pharao.
         7       Upon this the attendants of Pharao said to him, How long
            shall this be a snare to us ?         Send the men away that they may
            serve their God.        Dost thou not know that Egypt is ruined ?
         8 Then they brought back Moses and Aaron to Pharao ; and he
            said to them, Go and serve the Lord your God.                     But who and
         9 who are going ?         And Moses said, We must go with young and
            old, with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds,
        10 for it is the festival of the Lord.           Whereupon he said to them,
            The Lord be so with you !              as I send you away, must I also
            send away your substance ?            Take notice ! you have wicked in-
        11 tentions.      No : Let the men go and worship ; for this is what
            you desire.       So they drove them out from the presence of
        12 Pharao.       Then the Lord said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand
            against the land of Egypt, and let the locust come up against
            the land.      And it shall devour every herb of the field and all
        1   the fruit of the trees which the hail hath left.               So Moses lifted
            up the staff towards heaven and the Lord brought a south wind
            upon the land all that day and all that night, and by the morn-
            ing the south wind had lifted up a swarm of locusts and wafted
        14 it over the whole land of Egypt : and it settled on all the bor-
            ders of Egyptâ€”an immense swarm.                    Such a swarm of locusts
            had never been before it, nor shall there ever be such a one
        15 hereafter.      It covered the whole surface of the ground and the
            land was wasted.         And it devoured every herb of the ground
             and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left.              There was
            nothing green left among the trees, or among the herbs of the
        1G field throughout all the land of Egypt.                Upon this Pharao sent
            in haste for Moses and Aaron and said ; I have sinned in the
        17 sight of the Lord your God and against you ; therefore forgive
             this offence of mine this once more, and pray to the Lord your
        18 God; and let him remove from me this pestilence.                       Then Clo-
             ses went out from Pharao and prayed to God, and the Lord
                 vol. i.                           o
                                              â€”
       Ch. XI.                       EXODUS.
       19 brought a contrary wind with great violence from the sea ; and
           it lifted up the swarm of locusts and cast it into the Red sea, and
           there was not one locust left in all the land of Egypt.
       20     But the Lord suffered Pharao's heart to be stubborn so that
       21 he did not let the Israelites go.   Then the Lord said to Moses,
           Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven and let there be dark-
       22 ness over the land of Egyptâ€”a palpable darkness.            So Mo-
           ses stretched forth his hand towards heaven, and there was
           a darknessâ€”a thick, turbid darkness over the whole land of
       23 Egypt three days.      And for three days one saw not another,
           nor did any one rise from his place for three days ; but all the
           children of Israel had light in all the places where they were.
       24 Then Pharao sent for Moses and Aaron and said, Go and wor-
           ship the Lord your God.      But you must leave your flocks and
       25 your herds.    Your baggage may go with you.        And Moses said,
           But thou must give us burnt offerings and sacrifices to offer
       26 to the Lord our God.      Our cattle therefore must go with us.
           We cannot leave a hoof behind.        For of them we must take
           to worship the Lord our God ; and we do not know with what
           we are to worship the Lord our God, until we come there.
       27 Now the Lord had suffered the heart of Pharao to continue
           stubborn so that he would not let the people go, therefore Pha-
           rao said, Begone from me.     Take heed to thyself not to see my
           face any more.    For the day thou appearest before me thou
       28 shalt die.   Whereupon Moses said, Thou hast spoken.          I will
           not appear again in thy presence.
       XL       (Xow the Lord had spoken to Moses and Aaron in the
           land of Egypt and said, I will inflict yet one stroke more on
           Pharao and on Egypt and after that he will send you away
           from his country.     And when he shall send you away he will
           drive you out altogether in haste.    Speak therefore privately to
           the ears of the people, and let every one ask of his neighbour
         2 vessels of silver and gold and raiment.       And the Lord had
           given his people favour in the sight of the Egyptians and
         3 they supplied them.      The man Moses also was become very
           great in the sight of the Egyptians and in the sight of Pharao,
           and in the eyes of his attendants, therefore Moses said,)
         I     Thus saith the Lord, About midnight I will go into the
         5 midst of Egypt, and every first born in the land of Egypt shall
                            â€”
      Ch. XII.                           EXODUS.
           dieâ€”from the first born of Pharao who sitteth on the throne,
           to the first born of the female slave who is at the grinding
                                                                              CD      O
        6 mill, including also the first born of all the cattle.            And there
           shall be a great cry through all the land of Egyptâ€”such as
        7 hath never been, nor shall the like be again any more.                   But
           among all the children of Israel and their cattle not even a dog
           shall bark at man or beast, that thou mayst know what a dis-
           tinction the Lord will make between the Egyptians and the
        8 Israelites.    And all these thy servants will come down to me
           and make obeisance to me and say, Go away thou and all
           thy people whom thou wouldst take with thee.
        9       Then Moses went out from Pharao with indignation
           and the Lord said to Moses, Pharao will not hearken to you
           that I may fully compleat my signs and my wonders in the
           land of Egypt.
      10       (Though Moses and Aaron had done all those signs and
           those wonders in the land of Egypt in the presence of Pha-
           rao, yet the Lord suffered the heart of Pharao to be stub-
           born that he hearkened not to send away the Israelites out of
      XII.        the land of Egypt.        Now the Lord had spoken to Moses
        2 and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying, This month shall
           he to you the beginning of months.               It is the first for you
        3 among the months of the year.             Speak to all the congregation
           of the children of Israel and say, On the tenth of this month
           let them take every one a sheep according to the houses of
        4 patriarchal families, every one a sheep for a family ; and if
           there be too few in the family to be sufficient for one sheep,
        5 let him associate with him his next neighbour.                 With regard
           to the number of souls, every one shall collect to him a num-
           ber sufficient for a sheep.      Your sheep shall be without blem-
           ish, a male and in its first year.          You may take either from
        6 the lambs or the kids.       And it shall be kept up by you until the
           fourteenth day of this month.           Then the whole multitude of
           the congregation of the children of Israel shall kill it in the even-
        7 ing. And they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two
           side posts and on the lintel of the door of the house in which
        8 they are to eat it. And that night they shall eat the flesh roasted
           with fire.    They shall also eat unleavened bread with bitter
        9 herbs.     You shall not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but
                                      EXODUS.
       Ch. XII.
           only roasted with fire, head and feet and carcase together.
       10 Nothing of it shall be left till the morning.      And yon shall not
           break a bone of it.    And what is left of it till the morning you
       11 shall burn with fire.    And in this manner you shall eat it.    Your
           loins shall be girded.    Your sandals shall be on your feet, and
       12 your staves in your hands.      And you shall eat it in haste.    It is
           a passover to the Lord.          For in that night I will pass
           through the land of Egypt, and smite all the first born in the
           land of Egypt, both of man and beast.       And upon all the gods
           of the Egyptians I will execute vengeance.          I am the Lord.
       13 But the blood shall be to you for a sign on the houses in which
           you are.   And when I see the blood, I will protect you and
          there shall be no destroying plague among you, when I smite
       II in the land of Egypt.     And that day shall be to you for a me-
          morial.   And you shall celebrate it as a festival to the Lord
       15 throughout all your generations.       As an everlasting ordinance
          you shall celebrate it.     Seven days you shall eat unleavened
          bread.   And from the first day you shall remove all leaven out
           of your houses.   Whoever shall eat leaven from the first to the
           seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from among Israel.
       16 And with regard to the first day, it shall be proclaimed holy;
           and the seventh day shall be holy to you.        In them you shall
          not do any kind of sacrificial service, save that which must be
           done for every soul.    This alone shall be done for you and you
       17 shall keep this commandment.        For on that day I will lead out
          your host from the land of Egypt ; therefore you shall make
          the observance of that day an everlasting rite to your genera-
       18 tions.   Beginning at evening with the fourteenth day of the
           first month, you shall eat unleavened bread until the evening
       19 of the twenty first day.    For seven days there must be no lea-
           ven found in your houses.      Whoever shall eat leavened bread,
           that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation of Is-
       20 rael ; whether he be a stranger or born in the land.       You shall
           eat nothing that is leavened.     But in all your habitations you
           must eat unleavened bread.)
       21     Moses therefore convened the whole senate of the chil-
           dren of Israel and said to them, Go take for yourselves the
       22 sheep according to your families and kill the passover ; and
           ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and having dipped it in the
                                                       EXODUS.

             blood by the door you shall smear the lintel and the two side
             posts with some of the blood which is at the door; and none
             of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morn-
       23 ing.         For the Lord will pass by to smite the Egyptians ; and
             when he shall see the blood on the lintel and on the two side
             posts, the Lord will pass over that door and will not suffer
       21 the destroyer to enter into your houses to smite.                                        And this or-
             dinance you shall keep as a rite established for thee and thy
       25 children for ever.                  And when you come to the land which the
             Lord will give you as he hath spoken, you must keep up this
       26 religious service.                And if your children say to you, What is the
       27 meaning of this religious service ? then you shall say to them,
             It   is    the sacrifice of the Passover of the Lord; because he
            passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when he
             smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses.                                         Upon which
       28 the people bowed down and worshipped ; and the Israelites
       29 went and did as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron.                                                     And
             when they had so done, it came to pass that at midnight the
             Lord smote all the first bom in the land of Egypt, from the
             first born of Pharao, who sat on the throne to the first born of
             the captive in the dungeon, and even the first born of all the
       30 cattle.          Whereupon Pharao arose by night he and all his at-
             tendants and all the Egyptians                          and there was a great cry in all
                                                                  ;
             the land of Egypt ; for there was not a family in which there
       31 was not one dead.                     And Pharao called for Moses and Aaron
             by night and said to them, Arise and depart from among my
       32 people, both you and the Israelites.                                  Go and serve the Lord
             your God as you say.                      Take your flocks and your herds and
       33 go away, and bless me, I beseech you.                                       And the Egyptians
             pressed the people with great earnestness to hurry them away
             out of the country                for they said, We shall all die.
                                            ;
       31          So the people took up, upon their shoulders, their dough
             which had not yet been leavenedâ€”the masses of mixed up
       35 meal, bound up in their mantlesâ€”(now the Israelites had done
             as Moses commanded them; they had asked of the Egyptian
       36 gold and silver vessels and raiment, and the Lord had given
             his people favour in the sight of the Egyptians and they had
       37 supplied them, so they spoiled the Egyptians) and the Israel-
             ites to the number of six hundred thousand men on foot be-

          sides women and children began their march from Harnesses
      38 to Succoth.  And there went up with them a mixed multitude
      39 with nocks and herds and cattle in great abundance.    And
          of the dough which they brought out of Egypt they baked
         unleavened cakes, for it had not been leavened : for the Egyp-
         tians hurried them away and they could not wait, and they had
         not dressed any provisions for themselves for the journey.
      40     Now the sojourning of the Israelites which they and their
         fathers had sojourned in the land of Egypt and in the land of
      41 Chanaan was four hundred and thirty years.  And at the end
         of four hundred and thirty years all the host of the Lord came
      42 out of the land of Egypt. At night there was a watch for the
         Lord.  This watch of the Lord was instituted that very night
      43 to bring them out of the land of Egypt.    That it might be
         kept by all the children of Israel throughout their generations,
         the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, This is the law of the
      44 Passoverâ€”No stranger shall eat of it ; but every servant born
          at home or bought with money thou shalt circumcise and then
      45 he may eat of it. A sojourner or a hireling shall not eat of it.
      46 In one family it shall be eaten, and you must not carry any of
          the flesh abroad out of the house ; nor shall you break a bone
      47 thereof. All the congregation of the children of Israel shall keep
      48 this festival. And if any proselyte come to you to keep the pass-
          over to the Lord, thou shalt circumcise all his males and then he
          may come and keep it, and he shall be as a native of the land.
      49 No uncircumcised person shall eat of it.There shall be one law
      50 for the home born and for the proselyte who shall come among
          you.  Now the children of Israel had done as the Lord com-
          manded Moses and Aaron; and when they had done so, on
          that very day the Lord led the Israelites out of the land of
          Egypt with their host.
       XIII.    Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Consecrate
        2 to me every first boru.Every first born among the children
        3 of Israel, whether man or beast, is mine.  Therefore Moses
          said to the people, Kemember this day, in which you came
          out from the land of Egyptâ€”from the house of bondage.  For
          with a strong hand the Lord hath brought you out from this
        4 place ; and let no leaven be eaten, for on this day you are
        5 marching out in the month of new things.     And when the
          Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land of the
         Ch. XIII.                                                       EXODUS.

                 and the Jebnsites and the Gergasites and the Pherezites which
                 the Lord with an oath promised to thy fathers that he would
                 give theeâ€”a land flowing with milk and honey, thou shalt
            6 perform this religious service in this month.                                                                      Six days you
                 shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall
            7 be a festival to the Lord.                                       Seven days you shall eat unleaven-
                 ed bread.                Nothing that is leavened shall be seen with thee
                                                                                                                                                              ;
            8 nor shalt thou have leaven in all thy borders.                                                                      And on that
                 day thou shalt tell thy son and say, This is on the account of
                 what the Lord God did for me, when I came out of Egypt.
            i)   And it shall be to thee for a sign on thy hand and for a me-
                morial before thy eyes, that the law of the Lord may be in thy
                mouth ; for with a strong hand the Lord thy God hath brought
         10 thee out of Egypt ; therefore you shall observe this law in revolv-
         11 ing seasons from year to year.                                           And when the Lord thy God shall
                have brought thee into the land of the Chananites, as he sware
         12 to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee, thou shalt set apart eve-
                ry first bornâ€”all the males for the Lord.                                                       Every firstling of the
                kine or among the cattle which thou mayst have, even all the
         13 males thou shalt consecrate to the Lord.                                                             Every firstling of an
                ass thou shalt exchange for a sheep, and if thou wilt not ex-
                change it thou must redeem it.                                                   And every male first born
         14 of thy children thou shalt redeem.                                                     And if at any time hereaf-
                ter, thy son should ask thee saying, What is the meaning of
                this? thou shalt say to him, Because with a strong hand the
         15 Lord brought us out of the land of Egyptâ€”from the house of
                bondage; and, when Pharao hardened himself against send-
                ing us away, the Lord slew every first born in the land of
                Egypt, both the first born of men and the first born of cattle,
                therefore 1 sacrifice all firstlingsâ€”all the males to the Lord :
        16 and every male first born of my children 1 must redeem.                                                                                   And
                it shall be for a sign on thy hand, and immoveably before thy
                eyes.          For with a strong hand the Lord brought thee out of
                Egypt.
        17              Now when Pharao sent away the people, God did not lead
                them by the way to the land of the Philistines, because it was
                near.          For God said, Perhaps the people will repent when they
        18 see war and will return to Egypt : therefore God led the peo-

           pie by a circuitous march to the wilderness â€”to the Bed sea.
           And in the fifth generation the Israelites went up out of the
        19 land of Egypt.  And Moses took with him the bones of Joseph.
           For with an oath he had adjured the Israelites saying, The Lord
           will assuredly visit you and you shall carry hence my bones
           with you.
        20    And the children of Israel removed from Succoth and en-
        21 camped at Otham on the edge of the wilderness.      And God
           went before them, by day in a pillar of a cloud to shew them
        22 the way, and at night in a pillar of fire. And there was no
           failure of the pillar of a cloud by day, and of the pillar of fire by
           night before all the people.
        XIV.     Then the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Speak to the
         2 children of Israel and let them turn and encamp on the ground
           between Magdolus and the sea, from the sheep cot on the one
         3 side to Beelsepphon on the other. In front of these thou slialt
           encamp by the sea; whereupon Pharao will say to his people,
           The Israelites have lost their way in the land for the wilderness
         4 hath shut them in.   And I will make Pharao's heart stout, so
           that he will pursue them, and I shall be glorified by Pharao
           and by all his army.  And all the Egyptians shall know that
         5 I am the Lord.  Accordingly the Israelites did so. Now when
           the king of the Egyptians was told that the people had fled, his
           heart and the heart of his servants were turned against the peo-
           ple.  And they said, What is this we have done in sending the
         6 Israelites away from serving us ?Therefore Pharao equipt his
         7 chariots and took all his people with him.And having selected
           six hundred chosen chariots and all the cavalry of the Egyp-
         8 tians and officers of the highest rank over all (for the Lord had
           emboldened the heart of Pharao king of Egypt and of his at-
         9 tendants) he pursued the Israelites.Though the Israelites had
           gone out with a high hand, yet the Egyptians pursued them
           with all the cavalry and the chariots of Pharao.And his horse-
           men and his army found them encamped by the sea with the
        10 sheep cot on one flank and Beelsepphon on the other. And as
           Pharao approached ; the children of Israel raising their eyes
           saw the Egyptians encamping in their rear and were greatly
        11 terrified.And the Israelites cried to the Lord, and said to
           Moses, Was it because there were no graves in the land of

        Why hast thou dealt thus with us in bringing us out of Egypt ?
     12 Is not this what we told thee in Egypt saying, Let us alone,
        that we may serve the Egyptians ? For it was better for us to
     13 serve the Egyptians than to die in this wilderness.  Where-
        upon Moses said to the people, Take courage; stand still and
        see the salvation which cometh from the Lordâ€”which he will
        work for you this day. For in the manner you have seen the
        Egyptians this day, you shall never see them again any more.
     14 The Lord will fight for you.Be ye therefore silent.
     15    Now the Lord had said to Moses, Why criest thou to me ?
        Speak to the children of Israel and let them prepare for march-
     16 ing. And lift thou up thy staff and stretch forth thy hand over
        the sea and divide it, and let the children of Israel go into the
     17 midst of the sea as on dry ground.And behold I will embold-
        en the heart of Pharao and of all the Egyptians and they will
        go in after them. And I shall be glorified by Pharao and by
     18 all his army and by his chariots and by his horses.And all the
        Egyptians shall know, that I am the Lord when I make my-
     19 self glorious by Pharao and by his chariots and his horses.Now
        the Angel of the Lord who marched before the camp of the
        Israelites had removed and went behind them, and the pillar of
        cloud had removed from the front and taken its station in the
     20 rear. And when it came between the camp of the Egyptians
        and the camp of Israel and had taken its station ; there came on
        a thick darkness and night intervened so that they did not in-
    21 termix one with the other during that whole night.  And Mo-
        ses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the Lord restrain-
        ed the sea that whole night with a strong south easterly wind
        and made the sea dry ground ; and the water was cleft asunder.
    22 And the Israelites went into the midst of the sea as on dry
        ground.  And the water thereof was a wall on the right and a
    23 wall on the left.And the Egyptians pursued and went in after
        them, even all Pharao's cavalry and his chariots and chari-
    24 oteers, into the midst of the sea.And in the morning watch,
        the Lord cast a look on the army of the Egyptians with the
    25 pillar of fire and cloud, and threw the Egyptian army into con-
        fusion, and entangled their chariot wheels and caused them to
        drag on heavily ; whereupon the Egyptians said, Let us flee from
           VOL. i.                  p
                                                         â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
                                       EXODUS.
       Ch. XV.
           tlie face of Israel, for the Lord fighteth for them against the
       26 Egyptians.      Then the Lord said to Moses, Stretch forth thy
           hand over the sea and bring back the water to its place ; and let
           it  overwhelm the Egyptians, their chariots and their horse-
       27 men.     So Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and
           about day break the water was brought back to its place.            And
           when the Egyptians were fleeing below the water the Lord
       28 shook them off in the midst of the sea ; and the water being
           brought back to its place overwhelmed the chariots and the
           horsemen and all the host of Pharao who had marched after
       29 the Israelites into the sea, so that not one of them was left.       But
           the Israelites marched on dry ground in the midst of the sea,
           and the water was a wall to them on their right and on their
       30 left.   Thus did the Lord on that day deliver Israel out of the
           hand ofthe Egyptians.       And Israel saw the Egyptians dead on
       31 the sea shore.      And when Israel saw that great handâ€”what
           the Lord had done to the Egyptians, the people feared the
           Lord, and they put confidence in God and in Moses his ser-
           vant.
       XV.       Then sung Moses and the Israelites this song to G-od,
           and spoke saying,
             Let us sing to the Lord,
             For he is gloriously exalted ;
             Horse and rider he hath thrown in the sea.
        2    He was my help and defence for safety :
             He is my God, therefore I will praise him
             My father's God, therefore I will extol him
        3    A Lord crushing battles, his name is The Lord.
        4    Pharao's chariots and host he threw in the sea
             Chosen bandsâ€”Officers of highest rank.
             They were swallowed up in the Keel sea.
        5    In the sea, he whelmed them ;
             They sank to the bottom like a stone.
        6    Thy right hand,       Lord, is glorious in power.
             Thy right hand,       Lord, dashed enemies to pieces.
        7    With thy great glory thou didst crush thine adversaries.
             Thou sentest forth thy wrath ; it consumed them like stubble.
        8    At the blast of thy wrath the water parted
             The waters were compacted like a wall
                                                 â€”                                                                       :                            â€” â€”; ; :                                           ;       ;
                              XV.                                                                      EXODUS.
                Cb.
                                  The waves were condensed in the midst of the sea.
                    9             The enemy said, I will pursue and overtake,
                                  I will divide the spoilâ€”I will glut my vengeance
                                  My sword shall slay ; my hand shall prevail.
                10                Thou didst send forth thy blast, the sea covered them
                                  Theysank like lead in the mighty water.
                11                Who among the gods is like thee,                                                                                    Lord?
                                  Who is like thee ? G-lorifled among Holies
                                  Marvellous among Gloriesâ€”working miracles !
                12                Thou didst stretch forth thy right hand,
                                  The earth swallowed them up,
                13                In thy kindness thou hast been the guide
                                  Of this thy people whom thou hast redeemed.
                                  By thy power thou hast called them forth
                                  To thy holy place for resting.
                14                Nations have heard and are troubled :
                                  Pangs have taken hold of the inhabitants of Phylisteim
                15                The Emirs of Edom are already in commotion
                                  And as for the chiefs of Moab, horror hath seized them :
                                  All the inhabitants of Chanaan are appalled.
                16               On them let dread and terror fall.
                                  By the greatness of thine arm may they be petrified,
                                  Till thy people pass through,                                                                        Lord
                                  Till this thy people pass by, whom thou hast purchased.
                17                Introduce and plant them on the mount of thy heritageâ€”
                                  In the settlement thou hast prepared for thy dwelling,
                                  Lord
                                  The sanctuary,                                        Lord, which thy hands have prepared.
                18                The Lord reigneth for ever and for evermore.
                19                Because Pharao's cavalry with chariots and charioteers went
                           into the sea, and the Lord brought upon them the water of the
                           sea ; and the Israelites marched in the midst of the sea on dry
                20 ground; therefore Mariarn the prophetess the sister of Aaron
                           took in her hand a timbrel and all the women went out after
                21 her with timbrels in choirs, and                                                                                           Mariam led the song for
                           them, saying,
                                  Let us sing to the Lord,
                                  For he is gloriously exalted
                                   Horse and rider he hath thrown in the sea
             XVI.                     EXODUS.
        Oh.
        22     Then Moses drew oft' the Israelites from the Red sea ; and
            led them into the wilderness of Sour, and they marched three
        23 days in the wilderness and found no water to drink.      And when
            they came to Merra they could not drink the water there, for
           it was bitter.  Therefore they called the name of that place Bit-
        24 terness.  And the people murmured against Moses and said,
        25 What are we to drink ?      Upon this Moses cried to the Lord ;
           and the Lord shewed him a piece of wood and he threw it into
           the water, and the water was made sweet.
               There he instituted for them rules of rectitude and judg-
        26 ments, and there he proved them and said, If thou wilt hearken
           to the voice of the Lord thy God, and do the things well pleas-
           ing in his sight, and hearken to his commandments, and keep all
           these his rules of rectitude, I will not bring upon thee any of the
           diseases which I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord
           thy God who healeth thee.
       27      Then they came to Aileim, where there were twelve foun-
           tains of water and seventy palm trees, and they encamped there
           by the water.
       XVI.     And the whole congregation of the children of Israel
           removed from Aileim and came to the wilderness of Sin, which
        2 is between Aileim and Sina.       And on the fifteenth day of the
           second month after their coming out of Egypt all the congre-
           gation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and
        3 Aaron.    The Israelites indeed said to them, Oh that we had
           died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we
           sat by the pots of flesh meat and ate bread in plenty !        For
           you have brought us to this wilderness to kill this whole as-
        4 sembly with hunger.       Whereupon the Lord said to Moses,
           Behold I am going to rain bread from heaven for you.          And
           the people shall go and gather it day by day, that I may try
        5 them whether they will walk in my law or not.           But on the
           sixth day they must be provident in respect to what they bring
           in.  It shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
        6     Then Moses and Aaron said to all the congregation of the
          Israelites, In the evening you shall know that the Lord hath
        7 brought you out of the land of Egypt, and in the morning you
          shall see the glory of the Lord, by his hearkening to your nuir-
          murings against God.     As for us, what are we that you should
                                   EXODUS.
     Ch. XVI.
      8 murmur against us? (Now Moses had dictated, by the Lord's
         giving you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread
         in 'plenty, because the Lord hath heard your murmurings which
         you utter against us.    But as for us what are we? your mur-
         muring is not against us but against God.)
      9      Then Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the congregation
         of the children of Israel, Attend in the presence of Grod, for
     10 he hath heard your murmuring.         And when Aaron had spoken
         to all the congregation of the Israelites and they had turned
         about towards the wilderness, the glory of the Lord appeared
     11 in a cloud, and the Lord spoke to Moses saying, I have heard
     12 the murmuring of the Israelites.       Speak to them and say, To-
         wards evening you shall eat flesh and in the morning you shall
         be plentifully supplied with bread.     And you shall know that
     13 I am the Lord, your God.        Accordingly there came up in the
     14 evening a flock of quails, which covered the camp, and in the
         morning while the dew lay around the camp, behold on the
         face of the wilderness something small like coriander, white
     15 like hoar frost, on the ground !     And when the Israelites saw
         this they said one to another, What is this ? for they did not
     16 know what it was.       LTpon which Moses said to them.          This
         is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.           This is
         what the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it, every one for
         his family a gomer a head according to the number of souls,
     17 you must every one gather for those in the tent with you.
            And the children of Israel did so and gathered some more
     18 and some less, and when they measured it by the gomer, he
        who had gathered much had nothing over, and he who had
        gathered little did not fall short.   Every one had gathered suf-
     19 ficient for the family with him.       Then Moses said to them,
     20 Let none leave any of it till the morning.     Notwithstanding this
        they hearkened not to Moses, but some left of it till the morn-
        ing.   And it bred worms and gave an offensive smell.             On
     21 which Moses was angry with them.        So they gathered it every
     22 morning, every one a sufficiency for his family.      And when the
        sun grew warm, it melted away.
            Now on the sixth day when they were gathering a double
         quantity, two gomers for every one, all the heads of the con-
     23 gregation came and told Moses, whereupon lie said to them, Is
        Ch. XVII.                      EXODUS.
            not this what the Lord spoke, Sabbaths are a rest holy to the
            Lord ?   As for to-morrow, bake what you chuse to bake and
            boil what you chuse to boil and what is left lay up for to-mor-
        24 row.    So they left some of it till the morning as Moses com-
            manded them and it did not become putrid, nor was there a
        25 worm in it.     Then Moses said to them, Eat it to-day, for to-
        26 day is the Sabbath to the Lord.      It will not be found in the field.
            Six days you shall gather but because the Sabbaths are on the
        27 seventh day, therefore in it there will be none.         And it came
            to pass that on the seventh day some of the people went out to
        28 gather, but found none.       Whereupon the Lord said to Moses,
            How long will you refuse to hearken to my commandments and
        29 my law?      You see that because the Lord gave you this day for
            sabbaths, therefore on the sixth day he gave you the bread of
            two days.   Abide ye every one at home.        Let none go out from
        30 his place on the seventh day.       So the people rested on the se-
            venth day.
        31      Now the Israelites called its name Manna.       It was like cori-
            ander seed.    It was white ; and its taste was like a cake made
        32 with honey.      And Moses said, This is what the Lord hath
            commanded, Fill the gomer with Manna to be laid up for your
            posterity, that they may see the bread which you ate in the
            wilderness, when the Lord brought you out of the land of
        33 Egypt.     Then Moses said to Aaron, Take a golden urn and
            put therein the full of a gomer of Manna ; and thou shalt lay
        34 it up before God to be kept for your posterity.          As the Lord
            commanded Moses so Aaron laid it up before the testimony
        35 that it might be kept.     And the children ofIsrael ate this Manna
            forty years till they came to the inhabited land.        They ate it
            till they came to the border of Phoenicia.     Nowthe gomer is the
            tenth of the trimeter.
        XVII.       When all the congregation of the Israelites had remov-
            ed from the wilderness of Sin according to their encampments
            by the command of the Lord and encamped at Eaphidin and
         2 there was no water for the people to drink, and the people were
            reviling Moses and saying, Give us water that we may drink,
            Moses said to them, Why do you revile me ? And why do you
         3 tempt the Lord ?      Now when the people had thirsted there for
            water and murmured against Moses saying, How is this ? Hast
    Ch. XVIII.               EXODUS.
       thou brought us up out of Egypt to kill us aud our children and
     4 our cattle with thirst ? Moses cried to the Lord and said, What
       shall I do for this people ? They are almost ready to stone me.
     5 Upon which the Lord said to Moses, Go on at the head of the
       people, and take thee some of the elders of the people, and
       take in thy hand the staff with which thou didst smite the river.
     6 And thou shalt go to the place where I before caused thee to
       stand on the rock at Choreb ; and thou shalt smite the rock,
       and water will gush out that the people may drink.And Moses
     7 did so in the presence of the Israelites, and he called the name
       of that place, Temptation and Upbraiding, because of the up-
       braiding of the Israelites, and because they tempted the Lord
     8 and said, Is the Lord among us or not?  Now Amalek had
       come and made war on Israel at Eaphidin, upon which Moses
       said to Joshua, Select for thyself able men and go out and draw
     9 up in array to-morrow against Amalek; when lo I have stood
    10 on the top of that hill with the staff of God in my hand.So
       Joshua did as Moses commanded him.  And when he had gone
       out and drawn up in array against Amalek, and Moses and
    11 Aaron and Hur had gone up to the top of the hill, it came to
       pass that when Moses held up his hands Israel prevailed ; but
    12 when he let down his hands Amalek prevailed.   But Moses
       hands were heavy, therefore they took a stone and put it under
       him and he sat thereon ; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his
    13 hands, one on one side, and the other, on the other.So his
       hands were stayed up till the going down of the sun and Jo-
       shua discomfited Amalek and his whole people with the slaughter
    14 of the sword.Then the Lord said to Moses, Write this in a
       book to keep it in remembrance ; and rehearse it in the hear-
       ing of Joshua, that I will entirely blot out the remembrance
    15 of Amalek from under heaven.  And Moses built an altar to
       the Lord and called its name, The Lord my refuge; because
       with a secret hand the Lord fighteth against Amalek from ge-
      neration to generation.
   XVIII.     Now when Jothor the priest of Madiam, Moses' father
       in law heard of all that the Lord had done for his people Israel,
     2 (for while the Lord was bringing Israel out of Egypt Jothor
       the father in law of Moses had taken home Sepphora, Moses'
     3 wife, after she had gone back, with her two sons, of whom the
                                                                                  -
             XV1I1.                    EXODUS.
        Ch.
            name of one was G-ersam ; for he said, I was a stranger in a
         4 strange land ; and the name of the other Eliezar ; for the God
            of my fathers, said he, hath been my help, and hath delivered
         5 me out of the hand of Pharao) Jothor the father in law of Mo-
            ses came out to him with his sons and his wife to the wilder
         6 ness where he was encamped by the mount of God.                    And
            when they told Moses saying, Behold Jothor thy father in law
         7 is coming to thee with thy wife and thy two sons with him,
            Moses went out to meet his father in law and made obeisance
            to him and kissed him.        And when they had embraced each
         8 other he conducted them to his tent.       And Moses told his father
            in law all that the Lord had done to Pharao and to all the Egyp-
            tians for Israel's sake, and all the difficulties which they had
            encountered on the way, and how the Lord had rescued them
            out of the hand of Pharao and out of the hand of the Egyp-
         9 tians.   Whereupon Jothor was enrapt in wonder at all the good
            things which the Lord had done for them in delivering them
            out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pha-
        10 rao; and Jothor said, Blessed be the Lord.           Because he hath
            delivered these out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the
        11 hand of Pharao, I know now that the Lord is great above all
            the gods, for this reason because they were set against these.
        12 Then Jothor the father in law of Moses took whole burnt offer-
            ings and sacrifices for God ; and Aaron and all the elders of
            Israel came to eat bread before God with Moses' father in law.
        13 And on the morrow Moses sat to administer justice to the peo-
            ple, and all the people attended on Moses from early in the
        14 morning till late in the evening.      And when Jothor saw all that
            he did for the people, he said, What is this that thou dost for the
            people ? Why hast thou sitten alone and all the people attended
        15 thee from morning till night ?       And Moses said to his father in
            law, Because the people come to me to have a determination
        16 from God.     For when a controversy happeneth among them and
            they come to me, I administer justice to every one, and teach
        17 them the statutes of God and his law.        Thereupon Moses' father
            in law said to him, Thou dost not transact this business right.
        18 Both thou and this people with thee must needs be worn down
            by this intolerable service.    This business is too fatiguing for
        19 thee.    Thou canst not perform it thyself alone.       Now therefore
                                                                                                                ;
        Ch. XIX.                                    EXODUS.
             hearken to me and I will advise thee; and God be with thee.
       20 Be thon to the people as the Oracle of God; and lay their
             cases before God ; and testify to thern the statutes of God and
             his law ; and point out to them the ways in which they shall walk,
        21 and the works which they shall do : but look out for thyself from
             among all the people, for able, pious men, men of integrity
             who hate pride ; and set these over them as rulers of thousands,
             and rulers of hundreds, and rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens
             and let them administer justice to the people on all occasions :
        22 and the matter which is too high for them, they shall lay before
             thee ; but causes easily determined they themselves shall de-
       23 cide.        Thus they will remove a burden from thee and help thee.
             If thou do this God will strengthen tbee so that thou shalt be
             able to endure, and all this people shall go to their place with
        24 peace.         So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law,
       25 and did all that he said.                       And when Moses had chosen able
             men from among all Israel and made them rulers of thousands,
        26 and rulers of hundreds, and rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens,
             with orders to administer justice to the people on all occasions,
             and that they should lay before him the matter which was too
             high for them ; but the causes easily determined they them-
        27 selves should decide ; then Moses gave his father in law leave
             to depart and he returned to his own land.
        XIX.            Now on the first day of the third month after the depar-
             ture of the Israelites out of the land of Egypt, on the very day
          2 they came to the wilderness of Sinaâ€”when they had re-
             moved from Raphadin and came to the wilderness of Sina
          3 and Israel were encamping there before the mount, Moses
             went up to the mount of God.                         And God called to him out of
          4 the mount and said, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob,
             and announce to the children of Israelâ€”You have seen what
             I have done to the Egyptians ; and how I have taken you up
          5 as on the wings of eagles and brought you to myself.                                          Now
             therefore if         you will hearken diligently to my voice and
             keep my covenant, you shall be to me a peculiar people above
          G all the nations ; for the whole earth is mine : but as for you,
             you shall be a royal priesthood and a holy nation.                               These words
          7 thou shalt deliver to the children of Israel.                              Upon this Moses
             came and called the elders of the people and laid before them
                   VOL. I.                                  Q
       Cb. XIX.                  EXODUS.
        8 all these words which God enjoined on them.  And all the peo-
          ple with one consent answered and said, All that God hath said
          we will do and we will be obedient.    And Moses carried up
       9 these words to God.   Then the Lord said to Moses, Behold I
          will come to thee in a pillar of cloud, that the people may hear
      10 me speaking to thee and believe thee for ever.â€”When Moses
          told the Lord the words of the people the Lord said to Moses,
      11 Go down and testify to the people and purify them to-day and
         to-morrow and let them wash their garments and be ready
         against the third day ; for on the third day the Lord will de-
      12 scend upon mount Sina in the sight of all the people.  There-
         fore thou shalt remove the people to some distance round
         about and say, Take heed to yourselves not to go up to the
         mount nor touch any part of it.     Whoever shall touch the
      13 mount shall surely die. Ahandshall not touch him, for he shall
         be stoned with stones or shot with a dart.   Whether man or
         beast it shall not live.When the voices and the trumpets and
         the cloud are gone from the mount, they may go up to the
         mount.
      14    So Moses went down from the mount to the people and
      15 purified them, and they washed their garments. And he said to
         the people, Be ready, for three days you must not approach a
         wife.
      16    And it came to pass on the third day that about dawn there
         were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on mount
         Sina, and the voice of the trumpet sounded loud, so that all
      17 the people in the camp were terrified.  Then Moses led forth
         the people out of the camp to meet God, and they halted at the
     18 foot of the mount.    The whole mountain Sina was enveloped
         with smoke, because God had descended upon it in fire.   And
     19 the smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, so that all
         the people were exceedingly amazed.
             Still the sounds of the trumpet waxed louder and louder.
         Moses had spoken and God had answered him by a voice.    And
     20 the Lord descended upon mount Sina on the summit of the
         mount, and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount,
     21 and Moses went up.     And God spoke to Moses saying, Go
         down and testify to the people; peradventure they may come
         nigh to God to observe, and a multitude of them may perish.
         XX.                  EXODUS.
     Ch.
     22 And let the priests who come near to the Lord God be puri-
     23 fled, lest peradventure the Lord withdraw from them.  And
        Moses said to God, The people cannot advance to mount
        Sina; for thou hast testified to us saying, Set apart the mount
     24 and hallow it. But the Lord said to him, Away; go down
        and come up thou and Aaron with thee ; but let not the
        priests nor the people presume to come up to God lest perad-
     25 venture the Lord destroy some of them.   And when Moses
        had gone down to the people and spoken to them, the Lord
        spoke all these words saying,
     XX.     I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the
      3 land of Egyptâ€”out of the house of bondage.     Thou shalt
        have no other gods besides me.
     4     Thou shalt not make for thyself an idol, nor the likeness
        of any thing, which is in the heaven above, or in the earth be-
        low, or in the waters under the earth; thou shalt not worship
      5 them ; nor serve them ; for I, the Lord thy God, am a zealous
        God, retributing to them who hate me the sins of fathers upon
      6 children to the third and fourth generation ; but shewing mer-
        cy for thousands [of generations] to them who love me and
        keep my commandments.
      7    Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
        vain; for the Lord thy God will not hold him guiltless who
        taketh his name in vain.
      8    Kemember the day of the sabbaths to hallow it. Six days
      9 labour and do all thy works ; but on the seventh day are sab-
     10 baths to the Lord thy God ; On it thou shalt not do any work,
        thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man servant, nor
        thy maid servant, nor thy ox, nor thy ass, nor any of thy cattle,
     11 nor the stranger who sojourneth with thee; for in six days the
        Lord made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that
        are in them, and rested on the seventh day : therefore the
        Lord blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.
     12    Honour thy father and thy mother that it may be well
        with thee, and that thou mayst live long in that good land,
        which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
     13    Thou shalt not commit adultery.
     14    Thou shalt not steal.
     15    Thou shalt not commit murder.
       Ch. XXI.                  EXODUS.
       16    Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
       17    Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife ; thou shalt not
          covet thy neighbour's house, nor his field, nor his man ser-
          vant, nor his maid servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any of
          his cattle, nor any thing belonging to thy neighbour.
       18    And all the people looked towards the thunder and the light-
          nings and the sound of the trumpet and the mount which was
          smoking ; and all the people being struck with terror stood at
       19 a distance. And they said to Moses, Speak thou to us : and
      20 let not God speak to us lest we die.        Whereupon Moses
          said to them, Take courage ; for God is come to you to
          prove you, that the dread of him may be [in you, that you
       21 may not sin.    Then the people stood afar off, and Moses
       22 went into the thick darkness, where God was.       And the
          Lord said to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the house of
       23 Jacob and announce to the children of Israel, You have seen
          that I have spoken to you from heaven.   You shall not make
          for yourselves gods of silver, nor shall you make for yourselves
       24 gocls of gold. An altar of earth you shall make for me, and
          sacrifice thereon your whole burnt offerings and your offerings
          of thanksgiving, both your sheep and your young bulls in
       25 every place where I record my name.  And I will come to thee
          and bless thee. And if thou makest for me an altar of stones ;
          thou shalt not build it of hewn stones : for thou hast put thy
       26 workmanship on them and they are polluted.    Thou shalt not
          go up to my altar by steps, that thou mayst not discover thy
          nakedness on it.
       XXI.     And these are the rules of rectitude which thou shalt set
          before them.
        2    If thou purchase a Hebrew servant, he shall serve thee six
          years, but in the seventh year he shall go out free without
        3 ransom.  If he came in alone, he shall go out alone ; but if his
        4 wife came with him his wife shall go out with him.And if his
          master hath given him a wife and she hath born him sons or
          daughters, the wife and the children shall belong to his master,
        5 and he shall go out alone. And if the servant shall answer and
          say, I love my master and my wife and my children, I will not go
        6 away free, his master shall bring him to God's court of Justice
          and there lead him to the doorâ€”to the door post, and his mas-
      Ch. XXI.                   EXODUS.
         ter shall bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve
         him for ever.
       7    When any man selleth his daughter to be a handmaid she
       8 shall not go away as those who are in bondage go. If she please
         not her master provided he betrothed her for himself, he shall
         let her be redeemed ; but he is not her master to sell her into
         another family, because he hath broken covenant with her :
       9 but if he betroth her for his son, he shall deal by her accord-
      10 ing to the privilege of daughters. And if the son take another
         for himself, he shall not deprive her of food and raiment and
      11 her marriage rites.  And if he do not these three for her she
         shall go away ransom free.
      12    If any one smite another and he die, he shall be put to
      13 death.  But if he was not a voluntary agent, but God deliver-
         ed into his hands, I will appoint for thee a place to which he
      14 who hath killed shall flee.  But if any one lie in wait for his
         neighbour to kill him insidiously, and flee, thou shalt drag him
         from my altar to put him to death.
      15    He who smiteth his father or his mother shall be put to
         death.
      10    He who curseth his father or his mother shall be put to
         death.
      17    He who stealeth any of the children of Israel,'and having
         got him in his power selleth him, or if he be found with him,
         shall be put to death.
      18    If two men quarrel and one smite the other with a stone
      19 or his fist and he dieth not, but is confined to his bed ; if the
         man rise and walk abroad on his staff, he who smote him shall
         be acquitted but shall pay for his loss of time and the expence
         of his cure.
      20     If a man smite his man servant or his maid servant with a
         staff ; and the servant die under his hand, vengeance shall be
      21 taken by a judicial process ; but if the servant live a day or two,
         let no vengeance be taken, for he is his money.
      22     If two men fight and strike a woman with child and she mis-
         carry of an embrio, atonement shall be made by a fine.     Ac-
         cording as the husband of the woman shall with a judicial de-
      23 cision lay upon him, he shall pay : but if the child be compleatly
      24 organised he shall give, life for life ; eye for eye ; tooth fur
                                                                                                                              ;

            25 tooth ; hand for hand ; foot for foot ; burning for burning
            26 wound for wound ; stripe for stripe.                                  But if a man smite the
                  eye of a man servant, or the eye of a maid servant ; and it become
            27 blind, he shall set them free for their eye's sake.                                    And if he beat
                  out the tooth of a man servant, or the tooth of a maid servant,
                 he shall set them free for their tooth's sake.
           28          If a bull gore a man or a woman and he or she die, the bull
                 shall be stoned to death and his flesh shall not be eaten ; but
           29 the owner of the bull shall be held guiltless : but if the bull
                 hath heretofore been accustomed to push with his horns, and
                 this hath been made known to his owner, and he hath not shut
                 him up ; if he kill a man or woman, the bull shall be stoned and
           30 his owner also may be put to death.                                  But if a fine shall be laid
           31 upon him, he shall pay as a ransom for his life whatever they lay
                 upon him.            And if the bull shall gore a son or a daughter, they
           32 shall deal with him according to this law.                                    But if the bull shall
                 gore a man servant or a maid servant he shall pay their master
                 thirty didrachms of silver and the bull shall be stoned.
           33          If any man open a pit, or dig a pit and do not cover it, and
                 an ox or an ass fall therein, the owner of the pit shall make it
           34 good.           He shall pay the owner of them, and the dead beast
                 shall be his.
           35          If any man's bull gore the bull of his neighbour and he die,
                 they shall sell the live bull and divide the money and they shall
           36 divide the dead bull.                     But if the bull be noted for having been
                 heretofore accustomed to push with his horns, and this hath
                 been made known to his owner, and he hath not shut him up
                he shall be fined bull for bull and the dead bull shall be his.
           XXII.              If any man steal an ox or a sheep and kill, or sell it,
                 he shall pay as a fine five oxen for the ox, and four sheep for
                 the sheep.
             2         If a thief be found in the act of breaking in and be struck
             3 and die, he who struck him is not liable to death ; but if the
                 sun was risen upon him he is liable and may be put to death.
             4         If a thief hath no property, let him be sold for the theft.
                 If the thing stolen, whatever it be from an ass to a sheep, be
                 left alive and found in his hand, he shall be fined double.
             5         If any man cause a field or a vineyard to be eaten and shall
                send out his cattle to feed upon the field of another, with the

     Ch. XXII.
         produce of his own field he shall make restitution ; and if he
         shall cause a whole field to be eaten up ; with his choicest field
         or his choicest vineyard he shall make compensation.
      6      If a fire break out and catch in thorns and consume corn
         on the threshing floors or on the stalk, or in the field, he who
         kindled the fire shall make compensation.
      7      If any man deliver to his neighbour money or furniture to
         keep, and they be stolen out of the man's house; the thief, if
      8 he be found, shall be fined double.       But if the thief cannot be
         found, the owner of the house shall go before God and be ex-
         amined on oath whether he may not in some manner have ac-
      9 ted wrong touching the deposit of his neighbour.              On every
         supposed act of injustice touching an ox or an ass or a sheep
         or raiment or any kind of deposit which is lost, whatever it
         may be, the cause of both parties shall come before God, and
         he whom God pointeth out shall pay his neighbour two fold.
     10      And if a man deliver to his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or
         a sheep, or any beast to keep, and it be hurt or die, or be car-
     1   ried off by an enemy unknown to any one, there shall be an oath
         of God between the parties, that he hath not in auy manner ac-
         ted wrong touching the deposit of his neighbour ; and the
         owner shall thus be satisfied ; and the other shall not make it
     12 good.    But if it be stolen from him he shall make restitution
     13 to the owner ; and if it be torn by wild beasts he shall bring
     14 the owner to the prey and shall not make compensation.              But
         if any one borrow of his neighbour and that which was bor-
         rowed be hurt or die or be carried off by an enemy and the
     15 owner be not with it, he shall make compensation ; but if the
         owner be with it he shall not make it good, and if it be hired
         he shall have it for the hire of it.
     16      If any man delude an unmarried virgin and lie with her,
     17 he shall by paying a dowry purchase her for a wife : but if her
         father absolutely refuse and will not consent to give her to him
         for a wife, he shall pay the father in money to the amount of
         the dowry paid for virgins.
     18      You shall not protect sorcerers.
     19      Every act of bestiality you shall punish with death.
     20      He who sacrificeth to any god save to the Lord alone shall
         be destroyed by death.
                                                                                                                             ;

            21          A stranger you shall not injure ; nor shall you afflict him ;
                  for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
            22          A widow and an orphan you shall not afflict.                                   If you in any-
            23 wise afflict them and they cry to me, I will hear their voice
            24 and my wrath will be kindled, and I will slay you with the
                  sword, and your wives shall be widows and your children fa-
                  therless.
            25          If thou lend money to thy brother, who is near thee and in
                  want ; thou shalt not be rigorous with him, nor charge him in-
            26 terest.          And if thou hast taken the mantle of thy neighbour as
                 a pledge, thou shalt restore it to him before the setting of the
           27 sun ; for it is his covering.                          This mantle is the only covering
                 of his nakedness.                In what can he sleep ? If therefore he cry to
                 me, I will hear him ; for I am merciful.
           28          Thou shalt not revile gods, nor speak evil of the ruler of
                 thy people.
           29          The first fruits of thy threshing floor and of thy press thou
                 shalt not withhold.
           30          The first born of thy sons thou shalt give to me.                                              Thou
                 shalt do the same with thy calf, thy sheep and thy ass.                                             Seven
                 days it shall be with the dam and on the eighth day thou shalt
           31 dedicate it to me.                  You shall be men holy to me, and you shall
                 not eat what is torn by wild beasts.                              You shall throw it to the
                 dogs.
           XXIII.               Thou shalt not countenance an idle report, nor con-
             2 spire with the unrighteous to be a false witness.                                      Thou shalt not
                 be with the majority in wickedness, nor join with the multi-
             3 tude to shut out justice.                       In passing judgment thou shalt not
             4 be influenced by compassion for the needy.                                        If thou meet the
                 ox of thy enemy or his ass going astray thou shalt turn it
             5 back and restore it to him.                        And if thou seest thine enemy's ass
                 fallen under his burden thou shalt not pass it by, but shalt
                 raise it up with its load.
             6         Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of a poor man in the
             7 trial of his cause.                    Thou shalt keep aloof from every thing
                 unjust.        An innocent and a righteous man thou shalt not slay
                 nor shalt thou justify a wicked man for the sake of bribes.
             8 Bribes thou shalt not receive, for they blind the eyes of them
                 who see, and pervert judgment.

            You shall not afflict a stranger, for you know the heart of a
         stranger ; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
     10     Six years thou shalt sow thy ground and gather in the pro-
     11 ducts thereof; but on the seventh thou shalt give it rest and
        let it lie fallow, that the poor of thy people may eat, and what
        they leave, let the wild beasts of the field eat.The same thou
     12 shalt do with thy vineyards and thy olives.  Six days thou shalt
        do thy work ; but on the seventh there shall be a rest ; that thy
        ox and thy ass may rest : and that the son of thy handmaid and
        the stranger may repose.
     13     You shall keep all that I have said to you ; and make no
        mention of the name of strange gods, nor let it be heard out of
        your mouth.                                     to meâ€”the fes-
     14     Three times a year you shall keep a festival
     15 tival of unleavened bread you shall carefully observe.    Seven
        days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I have commanded
        you, at the time fixed in the month of new things.  For in that
     16 month thou didst come out of Egypt.      Thou shalt not appear
        before me empty.   Thou shalt also keep the festival of the in-
        gathering of the first fruits of thy labours employed in sowing
        thy field ; and the festival of completion at the end of the year,
     17 when thou hast gathered in thy labours from the field.    Three
        times a year all thy males must appear before the Lord thy
        God ; for when I have driven out the nations from before thee
        I will enlarge thy borders.
     18    Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ;
        nor shall the fat of my festival remain till the morning.
     19    The dedications of the first products of thy land thou shalt
        bring to the house of the Lord thy God.
    20     Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of its dam.
           Now behold I send my angel before thy face, that he may
        guard thee in the way, and bring thee to the land, which I have
    21 prepared for thee.   Take heed to thyself and hearken to him
        and disobey him not ; for he should not withdraw from you ;
    22 for my name is upon him.      If you will hearken diligently to
        this voice of mine, and do whatever I command thee, and keep
        my covenant, you shall be to me a peculiar people above all
        the nations ; for the whole earth is mine, but you shall be to
        me a royal priesthood and a holy nation.      These words you

                 shall deliver to the children of Israelâ€”If you will hearken dili-
                 gently to my voice, and do all that I command thee, I will be
                 an enemy to thy enemies, and an adversary to thy adversaries
           23 For my angel shall go before thee as thy leader, and conduct thee
                 to the Amorite and the Chettite and the Pherezite and the Cha-
                 nanite and the Gergasite and the Evite and the Jebusite, and I will
           24 exterminate them.                     Thou shalt not worship their gods nor serve
                 them.        Thou shalt not do according to their works ; but destroy
                 utterly and break in pieces their pillars and worship the Lord
           25 thy God.               And I will bless thy bread and thy wine and thy
           26 water, and turn away sickness from you.                                     There shall not be a
           27 man childless, nor a woman barren in thy land.                                             The number
                 of your days I will completely fulfil.                            And I will send terror be-
                 fore thee and confound all the nations to which thou shalt go
           28 and cause all thy adversaries to flee before thee.                                           And I will
                 send hornets before thee, and thou shalt drive out the Amo-
                 rites and the Evites and the Chananites and the Chettites from
           29 before thee.              I will not drive them out in one year, lest the land
                 become a waste and the wild beasts of the earth multiply against
           30 thee.          Bylittle and little I will drive them away from thee until
           31 thou art increased and canst possess the land.                                           And I will es-
                 tablish thy boundaries from the Ked sea to the sea of Philis-
                 teim, and from the wilderness to the great river Euphrates, and
                 deliver into your hands those who are settled in the land, or
           32 drive them out from before thee.                              Thou shalt not make a treaty
           33 with them and their gods, nor shall they dwell in thy land, lest
                 they cause thee to sin against me.                           For if thou serve their gods,
                 they will be to thee a stumbling block.
           XXIV.                Then the Lord said to Moses, Come up to the Lord,
                 thou and Aaron and Nadab and Abiud and seventy of the elders
             2 of Israel ; and let them at a distance worship the Lord ; and let
                 Moses alone approach near to God.                                  As for them they shall
                 not approach near ; nor shall the people come up with them.
             3         So Moses came and told the people all the words of God
                 and the rules of rectitude, and all the people with one voice
                 answered and said, All the words which the Lord hath spoken
             4 we will perform and we will be obedient.                                        Then Moses wrote
                 down all the words of the Lord.                             And rising early next morn-
                 ing Moses built an altar at the foot of the mount with twelve
                                   EXODUS.
     Ch. XXV.
       5 stones for the twelve tribes of Israel ; and he sent out the young
         men of the children of Israel and they brought up whole burnt
         offerings and slew young bulls for a sacrifice of thanksgiving
       6 to the Lord.    And Moses took half of the blood and poured
         it into bowls, and the other half of the blood he poured out
       7 against the altar.  Then he took the book of the covenant and
         read it in the hearing of the people, and they said, All that the
       8 Lord hath spoken we will do and we will be obedient.         There-
         upon Moses took the blood and scattered it towards the peo-
         ple and said, Behold the blood of the covenant which the Lord
       9 hath made with you touching all these words.           Then Moses
         and Aaron and Xadab and Abiud and seventy of the senate of
     10 Israel went up ; and they saw the place where the God of Israel
         stood ; and what was under his feet was like a pavement of Sap-
         phire, and in clearness like the appearance of the firmament of
      11 heaven.   And of these chosen men of Israel not one uttered a
         dissenting voice.
      12     Now when they had appeared in the presence of God and
         had eaten and drunk the Lord said to Moses, Come up to me
         on the mount and stay there and I will give thee the tables of
         stone, the law and the commandments which I have written to
      13 be promulgated to them.       Thereupon Moses arose with Joshua
      14 his attendant and they went up to the mount of Godâ€”Having
         said to the elders, Remain quiet here till we return to you,
         and behold Aaron and Hur are with you, if any one hath
      15 a controversy with another let them go to them.         Moses then
         went up with Joshua to the mount and the cloud covered the
      16 mount.    And the glory of God descended on mount Sina and
         the cloud covered it six days ; and on the seventh day the Lord
      17 called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.     Now the appear-
         ance of the glory of the Lord was like fire blazing on the top
      18 of the mount in the view of the Israelites; and Moses went
         into the midst of the cloud and ascended the mount and re-
         mained there forty days and forty nights.
      XXV.       And the Lord spake to Moses saying, Say to the chil-
       2 dren of Israel, Take offerings from all who may be willing.
       3 And these you shall take as dedications to me.      And this is the
          offering which you shall receive from them ; gold and silver and
       4 brass, and blue and purple and scarlet yarn, and cotton thread,
      Ch. XXV.                EXODUS.
       5 and goats' hair, and rams' skins dyed red, and skins of a violet
       6 colour, and incorruptible wood, and oil for giving light, and
       7 spices for the anointing oil and for the compound incense, and
         sardine stones, and stones to be engraved for the ephod and the
      8 robe which cometh down to the feet.And thou shalt make a
      9 sanctuary for me and I will appear among you.And thou shalt
        make every thing for me according to what I show thee on this
        mountâ€”according to the pattern of the tabernacle and the pat-
        tern of all its utensils, so shalt thou make them.
     10    Thou shalt make the Ark of the testimony of incorruptible
        woodâ€”two cubits and a half, the length, and a cubit and a
      11 half, the breadth, and a cubit and a half, the height.And thou
        shalt overlay it with pure gold.Within and without thou shalt
        overlay it.And thou shalt make for it a rim of gold welked
     12 and waved around. And thou shalt beat out for it four rings
        of gold and fasten them to the four corners, two rings on one
     13 side and two rin^s on the other side.And thou shalt make
     14 staves of incorruptible wood and overlay them with gold.And
        thou shalt put the staves in the rings on the sides of the ark,
     15 that with them the ark may be carried.The staves shall re-
     16 main immoveably in the rings of the ark.And thou shalt de-
        posit in the ark the testimonies which I give thee.
     17    And thou shalt make a propitiatoryâ€”a lid of pure gold, two
        cubits and a half, the length ; and a cubit and a half, the breadth.
     18 And thou shalt make two cherubs of turned gold, and place them
     19 at the two sides of the propitiatory.They shall be made, one
        cherub at one side, and the other cherub at the other side of the
     20 propitiatory.Thou shalt make the two cherubs at the two sides ;
        and the cherubs shall have their wings stretched forth above
        and shall overshadow the propitiatory with their wings ; and

        my presence before me continually.
     31     Thou shalt make also a candlestick of pure gold.         Thou
        shalt make it a turned work.   Its shaft and its branches and the

           curtain for joining them together.    Being directly opposite one

           thou shalt make fifty links of gold and fasten the curtains one
           to another with these links ;     and it shall be one tabernacle.

         18 shalt make all the pilasters of the tabernacle.                                                          And thou shalt
                make the pilasters for the tabernacle twenty pilasters for the

         20 And for the other side towards the south, twenty pilasters
         21 with their forty bases of silver, two for each pilaster for both
         22 the ends thereof: and for the end of the tabernacle which is
         23 towards the west thou shalt make six pilasters ; and at the corn-
                ers of the tabernacle out of the hinder ends thou shalt make
                two pilasters and the side on the end shall be of the same piece
         24 and as wide as the other sideâ€”both sides shall be equal from
                the corner to the first joint.                                That thou mayst do this at both
         25 corners the corner pilasters must have equal sides.                                                                    So there
                will be eight pilasters and their bases of silver sixteen, two for
         26 each pilaster for the two ends thereof.                                                   And thou shalt make

                is along the middle of the ranges of pilasters reach from one
         29 corner to the other.                             And thou shalt overlay the pilasters with
                gold.         And thou shalt make rings of gold into which thou shalt
         30 put the bars ; and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold.                                                                      And

          14 pieces of net work of pure gold intermixed with flowers, the
               work of a curious plaiter, and thou shalt put the plaited net
                works upon the little shields in the fore front of the shoulder
          15 pieces.         And thou shalt make the oracle of judgment, a work
                of an embroidererâ€”thou shalt make it, conformable to the
                ephod, of gold and blue and purple and scarlet yarn and cotton
          16 threadâ€”thou shalt make it four square.                                  It shall be double.
          17 The length of it a span and the breadth a span.                                        And thou
                shalt inweave in it a texture to contain stones in four rows.
                One row of stones shall be a sardius, a topaz and a smaragdus
          18 this shall be the first row.                     And the second row, an anthrax,
          19 and a sapphire and a jaspis ; and the third row, a ligure, an
          20 agate and an amethyst ; and the fourth row, a chrysolite and a
                beryl and an onyx.               They must be cased in gold, and bound
          21 together with gold according to their rows.                                   And the stones
                from the names of the sons of Israel must be twelve accord-
                ing to their names.                They must be engraved like seals every
          22 one with its name for the twelve tribes.                              And thou shalt make
                upon the oracle net works inwoven with it, a chain work of
          23 pure gold ; and thou shalt make for the oracle two rings of gold
                and thou shalt put the two rings of gold on the two upper ends
          24 of the oracle.            And thou shalt put the nettings and chain works
                of gold on the two rings on the two upper ends of the oracle ;
          25 and the other two ends of the two pieces of net work thou
                shalt put on the two pieces of plaiters work, so as to put them
                upon the shoulders of the ephod over against each other in the
            6 fore front.           And thou shalt make two rings of gold and put

              them on the two wings of the oracle on the very tip next to the
        27 lowest hinder tip of the ephod : And thou shalt make two rings
              of gold and put them below on both the shoulder pieces of
              the ephod, over against the upper juncture of the contexture
        28 of the ephod ; And from the two rings which are on it thou
              shalt bind the oracle to the two rings of the ephod, which are
              fastened with blue yarn and plaited into the texture of the
       29 ephod, that the oracle may not be loosed from the ephod.                                                            And
              Aaron shall carry on his breast the names of the children of
              Israel on the oracle of judgment, when he goeth into the sanc-
        30 tuary, as a memorial before God.                                           And upon the oracle of
              judgment thou shalt put the Manifestation and the Truth.                                                        And
              it    shall be on the breast of Aaron, when he goeth into the
              sanctuary, before the Lord.                             And Aaron shall carry the judg-
              ments of the Israelites upon his breast before the Lord con-
        31 tinually.              And thou shalt make a robe to be worn under this,
        32 which shall reach down to the feet, entirely of blue yarn : xVnd
              the opening of it at the neck shall be in the middle, having a
              hem round the opening, a woven work, the binding being in-
        33 terwoven with it, that it may not be rent.                                           And underneath the
              lower border of this robe thou shalt make clusters as of a
              blooming pomegranate of blue and purple and scarlet yarn and
              cotton thread.                Under the border of this robe round about thou
              shalt make clusters all of the same appearance and golden bells
        34 between them round aboutâ€”by a cluster a golden bell with
        35 a running branch on the border of the robe round about ; so
              that when Aaron officiateth the sound of him may be heard
              as he goeth into the sanctuary before the Lord, or cometh out,
              that he may not die.
        36           And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and engrave on
        37 it with the engraving of a seal, Holiness to the Lord, and thou
        38 shalt fix it on a blue lace ; and it shall be upon the mitre.                                                          It
              shall be upon the front of the mitre and upon Aaron's fore-
              head         and Aaron shall bear away the sins of the holy things
                        ;
              which the children of Israel may dedicateâ€”of every gift of
              their holy things.                    And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead con-
        39 tinually to make them acceptable before the Lord.                                                          Now the
               embroideries of the vestures shall be of cotton and thou shalt
               make a tiara of cotton, and thou shalt make a girdle, the work
      Cb. XXIX.                EXODUS.
      40 of an embroiderer.And for Aaron's sons tbou sbalt make ves-
         tures and girdles.Tbou sbalt also make tiaras for tbem for
      41 dignity and glory. And with tbese tbou sbalt clotbe Aaron
         thy brotber and bis sons witb bim.And tbou sbalt anoint tbem
         and fill tbeir bands and consecrate them that they may minis-
      42 ter to me in the priest's office.Moreover tbou sbalt make for
         tbem linen drawers to cover tbeir nakedness.Tbese shall reach
      43 from the loins to the thighs, and Aaron and his sons shall wear
         them when they come into the tabernacle of the testimony or
         when they come near to minister at the altar of the sanctuary,
         that they may not bring sin upon themselves and die.This
         shall be a perpetual statute for bim and bis seed after bim.
      XXIX.      Now these are the things which thou sbalt do for them.
         Tbou sbalt consecrate tbem that they may minister to me in
       2 the priest's office.For this purpose thou sbalt take one young
         bull of the herd and two rams without blemish and unleaven-
         ed bread tempered witb oil and unleavened cakes anointed
       3 witb oil.These tbou sbalt make of fine wbeaten flour and put
         them in one basket, and bring them in tbe basket, witb the
       4 young bull and tbe two rams.  Then tbou sbalt bring Aaron
         and bis sons to the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony
       5 and wash them with water.  Then taking the robes tbou sbalt
         put on Aaron thy brotber tbe robe reaching down to the feet,
         and the epbod, and tbe oracle ; and tbou shalt fasten for bim
       6 the oracle to the epbod.Then thou shalt put the mitre on his
       7 head and fasten tbe plate Holiness to the mitre.And thou shalt
         take some of the anointing oil and pour it on bis head and
       8 anoint bim. Then thou shalt bring his sons near, and clotbe
         tbem witb vestures and gird tbem witb girdles and put the
       9 tiaras on tbem.And the office of serving me as priests shall be
         theirs for ever. Then tbou shalt consecrate tbe bands of
      10 Aaron, and tbe bands of his sonsâ€”for this purpose thou shalt
         bring the young bull to tbe doors of tbe tabernacle of tbe testi-
         mony and Aaron and his sons shall lay tbeir bands on the
         head of the young bull before the Lord at the doors of the ta-
      ll bernacle of the testimony.Then thou shalt slay the bull be-
         fore tbe Lord at the doors of the tabernacle of tbe testimony,
      12 and tbou sbalt take some of the blood of the bull and put it on
         the horns of the altar witb thy finger ; and all the rest of the
                                                                                                                         ;:;

        13 blood thou shalt pour out at the base of the altar.                                           And thou
             shalt take the whole caul which covereth the belly and the
             lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with the suet on them
        14 and lay them on the altar : but the flesh of the bull and the hide
             and the excrements thou shalt burn with fire without the camp
        15 for it is a sin offering.                      Then thou shalt take one ram and
             Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram
        16 and thou shalt slay it ; and taking the blood thou shalt pour it
        17 around the altar.                 Then thou shalt cut the ram in pieces accord-
             ing to its members and thou shalt wash the entrails and the feet
        18 with water and lay them on the pieces with the head, and thou
              shalt carry up this whole ram on the altar for a whole burnt offer-
        19 ing to the Lord, for a sweet savour.                             It is a burnt offering to the
             Lord.        Then thou shalt take the other ram, and Aaron and his
             sons shall lay their hands on the head of this ram; and thou
        20 shalt kill it ; and thou shalt take some of its blood and put it
              upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his
              right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot ; and on the
             tip of the right ears of his sons, and on the thumbs of their right
        21 hands, and on the great toes of their right feet : and thou shalt
              take some of the blood from the altar, and some of the anoint-
              ing oil and sprinkle it upon Aaron and his raiment, and upon
              his sons and their raiment.                      So shall he and his raiment be hal-
              lowed ; and his sons and their raiment with him.                                     But the blood
        22 of this ram thou shalt pour against the altar round about.                                              And
              thou shalt take from this ram the fat tail, and the caul which
              covereth the belly, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kid-
              neys with the suet on them, and the right shoulder (for this is a
        23 consecration offering) and one loaf of oil bread, and one cake
              out of the basket of unleavened cakes which were laid before
        24 the Lord ; and thou shalt lay all these upon the hands of Aaron,
              and upon the hands of his sons, and set them apart as a dedi-
        25 cation before the Lord.                      Then thou shalt take them out of their
              hands and carry them up, upon the altar of burnt offerings for a
              smell of fragrance before the Lord.                            It is an homage offering to
        26 the Lord.              And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's
              consecration and set it apart as a dedication before the Lord,
        27 and thou shalt have it for a portion.                              And thou shalt hallow this
              breast dedication and the shoulder dedication which was set
       Ch. XXIX.                      EXODUS.
           apart and taken from the ram of consecration on account of
       28 Aaron and his sons ; and they shall belong to Aaron and his
           sons by an everlasting statute from the Israelites.      For this is a
           dedication and it shall be a portion taken from the Israelites,
           from the burnt offerings of thanksgiving of the children of Is-
           raelâ€”a portion set apart for the Lord.
       29     Now the sanctuary robes which are appropriate to Aaron
           shall be for his sons after him to be anointed in them and to
       30 consecrate their hands.     The priestâ€”that one of his sons who
           is to succeed him and come into the tabernacle of the tes-
           timony to minister in the Holies shall put them on seven days.
       ?A     And thou shalt take the flesh of the ram of consecration
       32 and boil this flesh in a holy place ; and Aaron and his sons
           shall eat the flesh of this ram and the bread which is in the bas-
       33 ket.   At the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony they shall
           eat those meats, with which they were hallowed to consecrate
       34 their hands with them, to hallow themselves.         None of another
           family shall eat of them, for they are holy.       And if any of the
          flesh of the consecration sacrifice or of the bread be left till
           the morning, thou shalt burn what remaineth with fire.        It shall
          not be eaten ; for it is a dedication.
       35     Having done thus for Aaron and his sons according to all
       36 that I have commanded thee, and consecrated their hands seven
          days, thou shalt offer on the day of the purification a young
          bull for a sin offering, and thou shalt purify the altar, when thou
       37 consecratest upon it, and anoint it so as to hallow it.         Seven
          days thou shalt purify the altar and hallow it, so shall the altar
       38 be most holy.     Whoever toucheth it shall be hallowed.          Now
          these are what thou shalt offer on the altarâ€”two yearling
          lambs without blemish every day on the altar continually, an
       39 offering of homage without intermission ; the one lamb thou
       40 shalt offer in the morning with a tenth of fine flour tempered
          with a quarter of a hin of expressed oil ; and for a libation a
       41 quarter of a hin of wine for the first lamb : and the other
          lamb thou shalt offer in the evening with the same cake offer-
       42 ing and the same libation as in the morning.          For a smell of
          fragranceâ€”as an offerino- of homage to the Lord thou shalt
          offer this continual sacrifice throughout your generations, at
          the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony before the Lord in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

                  44 Israel and be hallowed by my glory.                                                                                                                                                               And I will hallow the ta-
                                  bernacle of the testimony and the altar ; and I will hallow
                                  Aaron and his sons to minister to me in the priest's office
                  45 and I will be invoked by the children of Israel and will be
                  46 their God.                                                             And they shall know that I am the Lord their God
                                   who brought them out of Egypt to be invoked by them and
                                  to be their God.

                        2 Of incorruptible wood thou shalt make it a cubit long and a

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                .
                                   shalt overlay with pure gold its grate and its sides round about
                                  and the horns thereof.                                                                                             And thou shall make for it a wreathed
                        4 border of gold round about.                                                                                                                              And thou shalt make two rings
                                   of pure gold under its wreathed border for the two corners.
                                   Thou shalt make them on the two sides and there shall be
                        5 clasps for the staves with which it is to be carried.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And thou
                                   shalt make staves of incorruptible wood and overlay them with
                        6 gold.                                      And thou shalt place this before the veil, which is over
                                   the ark of the testimonies, from which I will make myself
                        7 known to thee.                                                                           And Aaron shall burn thereon every morning
                                   compound incense beaten fine.                                                                                                                                        When he replenisheth the
                        8 lamps he shall burn incense thereon.                                                                                                                                                                 And when Aaron light-
                                   eth the lamps in the evening he shall burn incense thereon
                                   every day continually before the Lord throughout their gene-
                        9 rations.                                              Andupon itthou shalt not offer any other incense offer-
                                   ing, homage offering, nor cake offering; nor shalt thou pour
                   10 a libation thereon.                                                                                               But Aaron shall make an atonement on
                                   itâ€”on the horns thereof, once a year.                                                                                                                                                            With the blood of the
                                  purifying sacrifice he shall purify it throughout their genera-
                                   tions.                             It is a Holy of Holies to the Lord.
                   11                              Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses saying, When thou
                   12 takest an account of the children of Israel, on being reviewed
                                   they shall give every man a ransom for his life to the Lord,
                                   so there shall be no destruction among them by the review
                   13 made of them.                                                                                 And this is what every one who passeth re-
                                    view shall give, the half of a didrachm, which is according to
           XXX.                 EXODUS.
       Ch.
          the holy didrachm, twenty oboli making a didrachrn.And this
       II half of a didrachm shall be an offering to the Lord.Every one
          who passeth the review from twenty years old and upwards
       15 shall give this offering to the Lord.He who is rich shall add
          nothing to it, and he who is poor shall deduct nothing from the
          half of a didrachm when you give this offering to the Lord to
       10 make atonement for your lives.And thou shalt take the money
          of this offering from the children of Israel and apply it to the
          service of the tabernacle of the testimony.And it shall be a
          memorial before the Lord to make atonement for your lives.
      17     Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Make a laver
          of brass with its base of brass for the purpose of washing.
      IS And thou shalt place it between the tabernacle of the testi-
      19 mony and the altar, and thou shalt pour water into it.  And
          out of it Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their
      20 feet with water. When they go into the tabernacle of the testi-
          mony, they shall wash with water.That they may escape death,
          when they go to the altar to minister as priests and to carry up
         the whole burnt offerings to the Lord they shall wash their
      21 hands and their feet with water; and when they go into the
         tabernacle of the testimony they shall wash with water that
         they may not die : and this shall be to them a perpetual ordi-
         nanceâ€”to him and his posterity after him.
      22     Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Thou thyself
      23 shalt take spicesâ€”the flower of choice myrrh five hundred
          shekels : and sweet scented cinnamon half as muchâ€”two hun-
      24 dred and fifty shekels ; and sweet scented calamus two hun-
          dred and fifty shekels ; and of iris five hundred shekels, sanc-
      25 tuary weight ; and olive oil a hin ; and of these thou shalt
          make an holy ointment, an odoriferous perfume, compounded
      26 by the art of an apothecary.  It shall be a holy anointing oil
          and with it thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the testimony
      27 and the ark of the tabernacle of the testimony and all the uten-
      28 sils thereof, and the candlestick and all the utensils belonging
          to it ; and the altar of incense ; and the altar of whole burnt
         offerings and all its utensils ; and the table and all its utensils
      29 and the laver. And thou shalt hallow them, and they shall be
      30 holy of holies. Every one who toucheth them shall be hallow-
         ed.  And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons and hallow
                                                                                                                                                â€”

         31 them to minister to me as priests.                                                  And thon shalt speak to
                the children of Israel and say, This shall be to yon a holy
        3:2 anointing oil throughout your generations.                                                         Upon the flesh of
                man it must not be poured ; nor shall you make any for your-
         33 selves according to this composition.                                              It shall be holy, and held
                in veneration by you.                            Whoever shall make any like it or give
                any of it to a stranger, shall be rooted out from among his
                people.
         34            Moreover the Lord said to Moses, Take thee spices
                stacte, onycha and sweet scented chalbanum and pellucid
         35 frankincense, of each an equal quantity.                                                         And of these they
                shall make compound incense mixed up by the art of an apo-
         30 thecary, a pure holy composition.                                               And thou shalt beat some
                of it fine, and lay it over against the testimonies in the taber-
                nacle of the testimony, where I shall make myself known to
         37 thee.             It shall be to you a most holy incense.                                             According to the
                composition thereof you shall not make any for yourselves.
         38 You shall consider it as a holy thing appropriate to the Lord.
                Whoever shall make any like it to yield a fragrance for him-
                self shall be rooted out from among his people.
         XXXI.                    Then the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Behold I have
           2 called by name, Beseleel the son of Ourius, the son of Hur,
           3 of the tribe of Judas, and filled him with a divine spirit of wis-
                dom and understanding and knowledge in every kind of
            1   workmanship, to contrive and execute as a master carpenter;
                and to manufacture gold and silver and brass, and blue and
           5 purple and scarlet yarn                                   and to cut stones ; and in works of
                                                                    ;
                architecture made of wood to execute all kinds of workman-
           ()   ship.         Him I have given with Eliab the son of Achisamach of
                the tribe of Dan.                       And to every man of an understanding heart
                I have given wisdom and they will make all that I have com-
           7 manded theeâ€”the tabernacle of the testimony, and the ark of
           8 the covenant, and the propitiatory upon it, and the furniture
                of the tabernacle, and the altars, and the table and all the uten-
                sils thereof, and the pure candlestick and all its utensils, and
           9 the laver with its base, and the sacerdotal robes of Aaron, and
         10 the robes of his sons to minister to me in the priest's office,
         11 and the anointing oil and the compound incense of the sanctu-
                ary.         According to all that I have commanded thee they will do.

       Ch. XXXII.                    EXODUS.
       12     Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Charge the
       13 children of Israel saying, See that you keep my sabbaths.          It
           is a sign between me and you throughout your generations,
           that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifieth you
       14 therefore you shall keep the sabbath, because it is holy to
           the Lord for you.    He who profaneth it shall surely be put to
           death.  Whoever shall do any work on it, that person shall be
       15 rooted out from among his people.        Six days thou shalt per-
          form works, but on the seventh day are the sabbaths, a rest holy
           to the Lord.    Whoever shall do any work on the seventh day
       16 shall be put to death.     Therefore the children of Israel shall
           keep the sabbaths and cause them to be kept throughout their
       17 generations.    It is au everlasting covenant between me and the
           children of Israel.  It is for me a perpetual sign that in six days
           the Lord made the heaven and the earth and rested on the
           seventh.
       18     Here he paused, and gave Moses, when he had ceased
           speaking to him on mount Sina, two tables of the testimony
           tables of stone written with the finger of God.
       XXXII.        (Now when the people saw that Moses delayed to
           come down from the mount, they rose up together against Aa-
           ron and said to him ; Arise and make for us gods who shall
           go before us ; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us
           out from the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of
        2 him.    Thereupon Aaron said to them, Take off the golden ear-
           rings which are in the ears of your wives and daughters and
        3 bring them to me.     So all the people took off the gold ear-rings
           which were in their ears and brought them to Aaron ; and he
        5 received them at their hands and having made of them a mol-
           ten bull he fashioned it with a graving tool and said, These
           are thy gods     Israel, who brought thee up out of the land of
        5 Egypt.    And when Aaron saw it he built an altar before it.
           And Aaron made proclamation, saying, To-morrow is the fes-
        6 tival of the Lord.     So rising early in the morning he caused
           whole burnt offerings to be brought up, and offered a sacrifice
           of thanksgiving ; and the people sat down to eat and drink and
           rose up to play.)
        7     Then the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Go quickly, go
           down from this place ; for thy people whom thou hast brought
         XXXII.                EXODUS.
    Ch.
     8 out of the land of Egypt have transgressed. They have quickly
        turned aside out of the way in which thou commandedst them
        to walk and have made for themselves a young bull and wor-
     9 shipped it ; and have sacrificed to it and said, These are thy
        gods,   Israel, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
    10 Now therefore let me alone, that being provoked to wrath
        against them I may utterly destroy them, and I will make thee
        a great nation.
    11     Upon which Moses made supplication before the Lord
        God and said, Shouldst thou,     Lord, be provoked to wrath
        against thy people, whom thou hast brought out of the land ot
        Egypt with great power and with thine uplifted arm, perhaps
    12 the Egyptians may speak, saying, With an ill intent he led
        them out to slay them on the mountains and utterly consume
        them from the earth.  Stay thy fierce indignation and be mer-
    13 ciful at this wickedness of thy people, remembering Abraham
        and Isaak and Jacob thy servants, to whom thou didst swear
        by thyself and didst speak saying, I will greatly multiply your
        seed like the stars ofheaven for multitude ; and didst say that thou
        wouldst give them all that land, that they should possess it for
    14 ever.  And when the Lord was moved with compassion to save
    15 his people, Moses turned and went down from the mount with
     10 the two tables of the testimony in his hands. Xow the tables
        were of stone written on both sides.On the one side and on the
        other they were written, and the tables were the work of God.
        And the writing was the writing of God engraved on the ta-
     ll bles. And Joshua hearing the sound of the people shouting
     18 said to Moses, There is a sound of war in the camp.       To
        which he replied, It is not the sound of men singing alternately
        as they rush to battle, nor is it the sound of men answering
        each other on a retreat, but the sound of responsive strains at
     19 a revel, which I hear. And when he approached the camp and
        saw the young bull and the choirs, Moses being inflamed with
        wrath threw the two tables from his hands and broke them at
     20 the foot of the mount.   And taking the bull which they had
        made he burned it with fire and grinded it fine and strewed
     21 it in the water and made the Israelites drink it. And Moses
        said to Aaron, What did this people do to thee, that thou hast
     22 brought upon them this great sin ?  Upon which Aaron said to
                                                                                                                      ;
                  XXXIII.                                  EXODUS.
          Ch.
                Moses, Be not angry, my lord, for thou knowest the irupetu-
          23 ousness of this people.                     For they said to me, Make us gods
                which shall go before us, for as for this Moses, the man who
                brought us out of Egypt we know not what is become of him.
          24 Whereupon I said to them, If any one hath golden ornaments
                take them off.            So they gave me and I cast into the fire, and
                out came that bull.
          25         And when Moses saw that the people were scattered abroad
                for Aaron had scattered and made them a derision to their ene-
          26 mies, Moses stood at the gate of the camp and said, Who is
          27 for the Lord ?              Let him come to me.                    Upon which all the sons
                of Levi joined him.                 Then Moses said to them, Thus saith the
                Lord the God of Israel, Gird ye every man his sword on his
                thigh and pass through and wheel about from gate to gate
                through the camp and slay every man his brother and every
               man his neighbour and every one him who is nearest of kin
          28 to him.           And the children of Levi did as Moses spoke to them
               and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
          29 For Moses said to them, Fill your hands to-day for the Lord,
               every one with his son or with his brother that a blessing may
               be bestowed on you.
          30         And on the following day Moses said to the people, You
               have committed a great sin, now therefore I will go up to God
          31 that I may appease him for this sin of yours.                                     So Moses went
               back to the Lord and said,                         Lord ! this people have commit-
               ted a great sin and have made for themselves gods of gold.
          32 Now therefore, if thou indeed forgivest this their sin, forgive
               it :   but if not : blot me out of thy book which thou hast writ-
          33 ten.        And the Lord said to Moses, Whoever have sinned be-
          34 fore me, them will I blot out of my book.                                   Now therefore go
               thy way ; go down and lead this people to the place which I
               commanded thee.                 Behold my angel will go before thee but
               on the day when I visit I will bring upon them this sin of
               theirs.
          35         Now when the Lord had smitten the people for making the
          XXXIII.                bull which Aaron had made, the Lord said to Moses,
               Depart, go up hence thou and thy people whom thou hast led
               out of the land of Egypt, to the land which with an oath I
               promised to Abraham and Isaak and Jacob, saying, To your
                                          EXODUS.
      Oh. XXXIII.
       2 seed I will give it.          And I will send my angel before thee
          and he will drive out the Amorite and the Chettite and the
          Pherezite and the Gergasite and the Evite and the Jebusite
       3 and the Chananite.           And I will bring thee to a land flowing
          with milk and honey : for I must not go with thee because
          thou art a stiff necked people, lest I destroy thee in the way.
       4 And when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned
       5 bitterly.     Whereupon the Lord said to the Israelites, You are
          a stiff necked people, take care that I bring not another stroke
          on you and utterly consume you.              Now therefore strip off the
          robes of your glory and your ornaments and I will shew thee
       (5 what I will do to thee.          So the Israelites stript off their orna-
          ments and took down the barrier from the mountain Chore!)
          and Moses struck his tent and pitched it without the camp at
       7 a distance from the camp, (Now it was called the tabernacle
          of the testimony,          and every one who sought the Lord
       8 went out to this tabernacle without the camp.                   And as Moses
          was going to the tabernacle without the camp, all the people
          stood looking, every one at his tent door, and kept their eyes
          upon Moses as he was going until he entered the tabernacle)
       9 And when Moses entered the tabernacle, the pillar of cloud
          descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and talked
     10 with Moses.        And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud
          standing at the door of the tabernacle all the people as they
     11 were standing worshipped every one at his tent door.                         And
          when the Lord had talked with Moses face to face as one
          would talk to his friend, Moses returned to the camp, but his
          attendant Joshua the son of Nave being young did not go out
          of the tabernacle.
      L2      Now Moses had said to the Lord, Behold thou sayest,
          Lead on this people, but hast not let me know whom thou
          wilt send with me.         Yet thou hast said to me, I know thee
     13 above all men and thou art in favour with me.                    If therefore I
          have found favour in thy sight manifest thyself to me in an
          evident manner, that I may see thee in what way soever I may
          have found favour in thy sight, and that I may know that this
     14 great nation is thy people.          And he said, Must I myself go be-
     15 fore thee and give thee rest ?            To which Moses replied, Unless
          thou thyself accompany us, take me not away from this place :
      Ch. XXXIV.                 EXODUS.
      16 for how can it be known for certain that I and this people
         have found favour in thy sight, but by thy going with us ? or
         I and this people be glorious above all that are on the earth ?
      17 Then the Lord said to Moses, Even this which thou hast said,
         I will do for thee ; for thou hast found favour in my sight and
      18 I know thee above all men.   Upon which Moses said, Mani-
      19 fest thyself to me.And he said, I will go before thee with my
         glory and I will call by my name The Lord, before thee ; and
         I will have mercy on whom I please to have mercy ; and I will
         have compassion on whomsoever I compassionate ; but, said
      20 he, thou canst not see my face ; for no man can see my face
      21 and live. Then the Lord said, Behold there is a place near me.
         Thou shalt stand upon the rock, and when my glory is passing
      22 by, I will place thee in a cleft of the rock and cover thee with
      23 my hand over thee, until I pass by, then I will withdraw my
         hand and then thou shalt see what are behind me but my face
         cannot be seen by thee.
      XXXIY.       Then the Lord said to Moses, Hew thee two tables
         of stone like the first and come up to me on the mount, and I
          will write on those tables the words which were in the first
       2 tables which thou didst break ; and be ready against the morning
         and thou shalt come up to mount Sina, and wait for me there
       3 on the top of the mount, but let none come up with thee nor
          be seen in all the mountain ; and let neither flocks nor herds
       4 pasture near the mount.  So when Moses had hewn two tables
          of stone such as the first he arose early in the morning and
       5 went up mount Sina, as the Lord had commanded him.     And
          Moses took the two tables of stone and the Lord descended in
          a cloud and stood by him there and called in the name of the
        6 Lord. And the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed,
          The Lord, the God compassionate and merciful, long suffering and
        7 abundant in goodness and truth, keeping kindness and mercyfor
          thousands, taking away transgressions, iniquities and sins, will by
          no means clear the guilty, when he bringeth the transgressions
          of fathers on children and children s children to the third and
        8 fourth generation.Upon which Moses made haste and having
          bowed down on the ground he worshipped and said, If I have
        9 found favour in thy sight ; let my Lord go with us : for this
          people is stiff necked, and thou wilt take away our sins and our
         XXXIV.                   EXODUS.
     Ch.
     10 iniquities and we shall be for thee.   And the Lord said to Mo-
        ses, Behold I make a covenant with thee, Before all thy people
        I will do marvellous things such as have not been done in all
        the earth nor in any nation.    And all the people among whom
        thou art shall see the works of the Lord, that those which I shall
     11 do for thee are marvellous.   Attend thou to all that I command
        thee.   Behold I drive out before you the Amorite and the
        Chananite and the Pherezite and the Chettite and the Evite
     12 and the Gergasite and the Jebusite : Take thou heed to thyself
        that thou make not a covenant with the inhabitants of the land
        to which thou art going, lest it become a stumbling block to
     13 you.   Their altars you shall demolish : their pillars you shall
        break to pieces ; and their groves you shall cut down ; and the
     14 graven images of their gods you shall burn with fire.          For
        you must not worship other gods ; for the Lord God, a zealous
     15 name, is a zealous God.      Peradventure, shouldst thou make
        a covenant with those settled in that land, when they go a
        whoring after their gods and sacrifice to their gods and invite
     16 thee thou mayst eat with them ; and shouldst thou take their
        daughters for thy sons and give some of thy daughters to their
        sons, thy daughters may go a whoring after their gods and
     17 thy sons may go a whoring after their gods.        Thou shalt not
     18 make for thyself molten gods.         The festival of unleavened
        bread thou shalt keep.     Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened
        bread as I commanded thee at the set time in the month of
        new things ; for in the month of new things thou didst come
     19 out of Egypt.     With regard to every firstling, the males are
     20 mineâ€”every firstling of kine and sheep ; but the firstling of
        an ass thou shalt redeem with a sheep ; and if thou wilt not
        redeem it with that thou shalt pay the worth of it.     Every first
     21 born of thy sons thou shalt redeem.       Thou shalt not appear
        before me empty.       Six days perform works, but on the se-
        venth thou shalt rest.    In seeding time and harvest it shall be
     22 a rest.  The festival of weeks thou shalt celebrate for me at
         the beginning of the reaping of wheat ; and the festival of the
     2o ingathering in the middle of the year.      Three times a year all
         thy males shall appear before the Lord the God of Israel.
     24 For when I shall have driven out the nations from before thee
         and enlarged thy borders, none shall covet thy land, when
                                                                                                                             ;-
                   XXXV.                                         EXODUS.
            Ch.
                 thou comest up to appear before the Lord thy God three
            25 times a year.                Thou shalt not offer the blood of my burnt of-
                  ferings with leaven, nor shall the victims of the passover fes-
            26 tival remain till the morning.                           The first fruits of thy land thou
                  shalt lay by for the house of the Lord thy God.                                           Thou shalt
                  not boil a lamb in the milk of its dam.
            27          Then the Lord said to Moses, Write for thyself these
                  words ; for on these terms I have made a covenant with thee
                  and Israel.
            28          And Moses was there before the Lord forty days and forty
                 nights.         He did not eat bread nor drink water.                                  And he wrote
                 on the tables the words of the covenantâ€”the ten coramand
           29 ments.            And when Moses came down from the mount with
                 the two tables in his hands, he did not know, while he was
                 coming down from the mount, that the skin of his face had
           30 been irradiated with glory by his talking with him ; but when
                 Aaron and all the elders of Israel saw Moses, and that the
                 skin of his face was irradiated with glory, they were afraid to
           31 approach him.                     Whereupon Moses called them ; and Aaron
                 and all the chiefs of the congregation turned to him and Moses
           32 spoke to them.                  And after that all the sons of Israel came to
                 him ; and he enjoined upon them all that the Lord had given
           33 him in charge on mount Sina.                                 And when he had clone speak-
           34 ing to them he put a veil on his face.                                     But when Moses went
                 in before the Lord to speak to him he took off the veil until he
           35 came out, and when he came out and rehearsed to all the chil-
                 dren of Israel what the Lord commanded him (as the children
                 of Israel saw that Moses' face was irradiated with glory there-
                 fore) Moses put the veil on his face until he should go in to
                 speak to him.
           XXXV.                 Then Moses assembled all the congregation of the
             2 Israelites and said, These are the things which the Lord said
                 you shall do.              Six days thou shalt perform works ; but on the
                 seventh there shall be a rest, holy sabbaths, a rest to the Lord
             3 whoever doth work on it let him be put to death.                                               You shall
                 not kindle a fire in any of your habitations on the sabbath day.
             4 I am the Lord.                   Again Moses spoke to all the congregation of
                 the Israelites and said, This is the thing which the Lord hath
             5 commanded saying, Take from yourselves an offering for the
     Ch. XXXV.                      EXODUS.
         Lord.   Let every one whose heart is so disposed bring these
       6 offerings to the Lord, gold, silver, brass, bine, purple and
       7 scarlet yarn doubled ; and cotton thread and goats' hair and
       8 rams' skins dyed red and skins dyed blue and incorruptible
       9 wood and sardine stones and stones to be engraved for the
     10 ephod and the long robe ; and let every wise hearted man among
         you come and make all the works which the Lord hath con-
     11 mandedâ€”the tabernacle, and the coverings, and upper cover-
     12 ings and the hangings, and the bars and the pilasters, and the
         ark of the testimony with its staves and its propitiatory, and
         the veil and the hangings of the court with its pillars, and the
         smaragdine stones and the incense and the anointing oil and
         the table with all its utensils, and the candlestick for light with
         all its utensils, and the altar with all its utensils, and the holy
     19 garments of Aaron the priest, and the robes and the sacerdotal
         vestures for the sons of Aaron in which they are to minister
         and the anointing oil and the compound incense.
     20      Thereupon all the congregation of the children of Israel
         went out from Moses and all whose heart prompted them and
         all to whom it seemed good in their mind brought every one
     21 an offering.    And when they had brought an offering to the
         Lord for all the works of the tabernacle of the testimony, and
     22 for all its appurtenances, and for all the holy garments, then the
         men brought from their wivesâ€”every one as it seemed good
         brought seals and pendants and rings and necklaces and brace-
     23 lets and all sorts of jewels of gold.       And when they had all
         brought their offerings of gold to the Lord, then every one who
         had cotton or skins of blue or rams' skins dyed red brought
     24 them ; And every one who had made a dedication of silver or
         brass brought them as offerings to the Lord; and they who
     25 had incorruptible timber did the same.          And when they had
         brought materials for all the works of the service, then every
         woman skilled in spinning brought blue and purple and scar
     2b' let and cotton thread ; and all the women who had understand-
     27 ing and skill spun the goats' hair.      And the chiefs brought the
         smaragdine stones and the stones to be set in the ephod and the
     28 oracle, and the materials both for the anointing oil and the com-
         pound incense.
             vol. i.                     u
           XXXVI.                 EXODUS.
       Ch.
       29     And when all the Israelites, men and women, whose un-
          derstanding prompted them to promote all the works which the
          Lord had by Moses commanded them to make, had brought
       30 an offering to the Lord, then Moses said to the children of Is-
          rael, Behold God hath called by name Beseleel the son of
       31 Ourius the son of Hur of the tribe of Jnclas and filled him with
          a divine spirit of wisdom and understanding and skill in all
       32 things to execute all works of architecture and to work up
       33 o-old and silver and brass and to cut stones and to model wood
       34 and to perform every kind of curious workmanship.     He hath
          indeed qualified him and Eliab the son of Achisamach of the
       35 tribe of Dan and hath filled them with wisdom, knowledge
          and skill to know how to make all the works of the sanctuary,
          and to weave the embroidery and tapestry with scarlet yarn
          and cotton threadâ€”to execute every kind of work in archi-
          tecture and embroidery.
       XXXVI.       Accordingly Beseleel and Eliab and       every man
          skilled in arts, to whom had been given wisdom and under-
          standing to know how to execute every kind of work suitable
          for the holy service, performed it according to all that the
        2 Lord had commanded.        When Moses called Beseleel and
          Eliab and all who had skillâ€” every one in whose heart Grod
          had put knowledge and all who were freely willing to come to
        3 the work so as to finish it compleatly, they received from Mo-
          ses all the offerings which the Israelites had brought for mak-
          ing all the works of the sanctuary.They received also the offer-
          ings from those who still continued to bring them in, every
        4 morning.   And all the artists who did the works of the sanc-
          tuary attended diligently every one at the work in which he was
        5 engaged.   And when Moses was told that the people were
          bringing in more than sufficient for all the works which the
        6 Lord had ordered to be made, Moses issued orders and caused
          proclamation to be made throughout the camp saying, Let nei-
          ther man nor woman make any more work for the offerings
        7 of the sanctuary.  So the people were restrained from bringing
           any more ; for the materials which they had were sufficient for
           all the work to be done ; and there was an overplus.
        8     Xow the most skilful among the workmen made the holy
           garments, which are appropriate to Aaron the priest as the Lord

       commanded Moses.   They made the ephod of gold and of blue
       and purple and scarlet yarn and cotton thread, the thin plates
       of Â£rold being: cut into fine threads so as to be inwoven with
       the blue and purple and with the scarlet yarn and cotton thread.
       They made it a woven work, the shoulder pieces having from
       both the sides a work woven one piece into another alternately,
       each convoluted through itself out of itself.They made it ac-
       cording to its peculiar fabrick of gold and blue and purple and
       scarlet yarn and cotton thread as the Lord commanded Moses.
       And they worked the two smaragdine stones fastened with it
       and set in gold, which were excavated and engraven, like the
       engraving of a seal, with the names of the sons of Israel ; and
       put them on the shoulders of the ephod, as stones of remem-
       brance of the children of Israel, as the Lord commanded Moses.
       And they made the Oracle, a work of embroidery, like the
       workmanship of the ephod, of gold and blue and purple and
       scarlet yarn and cotton thread.The Oracle they made double,
       and it was square, a span, the length ; and a span, the breadth
       on both sides.And there was interwoven with it a texture con-
       taining stones in four rows ; the first row of stones, a sardine
       and a topaz and a smaragdus ; and the second row, an anthrax
       and a sapphire and a jaspis ; and the third row, a ligure and an
       agate and an amethyst, and the fourth row, a chrysolite and a
       beryl and an onyx, set in gold and bound in with gold.Now
       these stones were twelve from the names of the sons of Israel,
       engraven like seals, every one with its peculiar name, for the
       twelve tribes.And on the oracle they made pieces of plaited
       net work, the work of a plaiter, of pure gold.They made also
       two little shields of gold and two rings of gold ; and they put
       the two rings of gold on the two upper sides of the oracle;
       and they put the two pieces of plaited work of gold on the two
       rings on the two sides of the oracle ; and they put the two
       pieces of plaited work for the the two junctions, on the
       two shields which were on the shoulders of the ephod over
       against each other in front ; and they made two rings of gold
       and put them on the two wings below the tip of the oracle and
       on the tip of the hinder part of the ephod on the inside ; and
       they made two rings of gold and put them on both the shoul-
       der pieces of the ephod underneath, over against the upper junc-

           tion of the texture of the ephod ; and they fastened the oracle
           by the rings on it to the rings of the ephod which were fast-
           ened to it with blue yarn, being plaited into the texture of the
           ephod, that the oracle might not be loosed from the ephod, as
           the Lord commanded Moses.         And they made the long robe
           under the ephod, a woven work, all of blue yarn : and the open-
           ing of the under robe in the middle was woven with a binding
           of plaited work, having a hem all around the hole that it might
           not be rent.   And on the border of the robe below, they made
           clusters as of a blooming pomegranate of blue and purple and
           scarlet yarn and cotton thread : And they made golden bells
           and put the bells on the border of the robe round about be-
           tween the clusters, a golden bell and a cluster on the border
           of the robe round about, to minister in as the Lord commanded
           Moses.
               And they made cotton vestures, a woven work for Aaron
           and his sons and the tiaras of cotton and the mitre of cotton
           and the drawers of cotton, and the girdles of cotton thread and
           of blue and purple and scarlet yarn a work of embroidery as
           the Lord commanded Moses.
               And they made the plate of gold, a dedication of the sanc-
           tuary, of pure gold, and wrote thereon in letters engraved like a
           seal, Holiness to the Lord, and put it on a ribbon of blue that
           it might be hung upon the mitre above as the Lord command-
           ed Moses.
       XXXYII.        They made also for the tabernacle ten curtains, the
           first eight and twenty cubits long and all the rest the same,
           and four cubits broad.     And they made the veil of blue and
           purple and scarlet yarn and cotton thread, a work woven with
           cherubs and they put this on four pillars of incorruptible wood
           overlaid with gold, the capitals of which were of gold, and
           their four bases of silver.    And they made the curtain of the
           door of the tabernacle of the testimony of blue and purple
           and scarlet yarn and cotton thread, a work woven with che-
           rubs, and their five pillars and hooks, the capitals and hooks
           of which they overlaid with gold, but their five bases were
           of  brass.   And they made the court â€”on the south side
           the hangings of the court were of cotton, a hundred cubits long
           with their twenty pillars, and the twenty bases thereof; and on

        the north they were the same as on the sonth side, a hundred
        cnbits with their twenty pillars and the twenty bases thereof;
        but on the end towards the sea [the west] the hangings were
        fifty cubits, and their pillars ten with their ten bases ; and on
        the east end fifty cubits, the hangings on one side of the
        gateway were fifteen cubits, their pillars three and their ba-
        ses three, and on the other side of the gateway of the court,
        the hangings were fifteen cubits, their pillars three and their
        bases three.  All these hangings of the tabernacle were of cot-
        ton and the bases of the pillars were of brass, but their hooks
        were of silver and their capitals were overlaid with silver. And
        the pillarsâ€”all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.
        And the curtain of the gate of the court was a work of tapestry
        of blue and purple and scarlet yarn and cotton thread, twenty
        cubits long and the height and breadth, five cubits, answering
        the hangings of the court, and their pillars were four, the four
        bases of which were of brass but their hooks were of silver
        and their capitals were overlaid with silver, and all the pins of
        the court round about were of brass but they were overlaid
        with silver.  This was the arrangement of the tabernacle of the
        testimony, as it was given in charge to Moses, that the service
        thereof should belong to the Levites under the direction of
        Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.     Now Beseleel the son of
        Ourius of the tribe of Judas performed the work as the Lord
        commanded Moses, he and Eliab the son of Achisamach of
        the tribe of Dan, who was the head workman in making the
        woven work and the embroidery and the tapestry of scarlet
        yarn and cotton thread.
     XXXVIII.        Beseleel also made the ark and overlaid it with
        pure gold within and without ; and he cast the four rings of
        gold, two on the one side and two on the other, wide enough
        for the staves, with which it was to be carried : and he made
        the propitiatory above the ark of pure gold, and the two che-
        rubs of gold, one cherub at one end of the propitiatory and the
        other cherub at the other end of the propitiatory overshadow-
        ing the propitiatory with their wings.    And he made the table
        to be set before it of pure gold ; and cast for it four rings, two
        on one side and two on the other, wide enough to receive the
         staves. And he made the staves of the ark and of the table, ana
                                                                                                                                                         :;
              Ch. XXXIX.                                                EXODUS.
                     overlaid tkera with gold.                                And he made the vessels for the ta-
                     ble, the platters and the censers and the large goblets and the
                     cups for making libations, all of gold.                                               And he made the can-
                     dlestick to give light also of gold, the shaft solid, and the six
                     branches on both its sides.                               Out of its branches were knobs, three
                    on one side and three on the other answering each other; and
                     their lamp dishes on the tops were made in the form of almonds
                     out of the same piece, with sockets in them for the lamps to
                     rest on, and the seventh socket on the top of the shaft was solid,
                     entirely of gold ; and he made the seven lamps upon it of gold
                     and its snuffers of gold, and its oil vessels of gold.                                                               He also
                    overlaid the pilasters with gold and cast gold rings for each
                     pilaster and overlaid the bars with gold.                                                    He also gilded the
                    pillars of the veil with gold and made the golden hooks, and he
                    made the links of the tabernacle of gold, and the hooks of the
                    court and the hooks for stretching the upper covering, of brass.
                    He cast the silver capitals of the tabernacle and the brass capi-
                    tals of the door of the tabernacle and for the gate of the court
                    and he made the silver hooks for the pillarsâ€”those on the top
                    of the pillars he overlaid with silver.                                             He made the brass pins
                    of the tabernacle and the brass pins of the court.                                                         He made the
                    brasen altar out of the brasen censers which belonged to the
                    men who conspired with the congregation of Kore.                                                                   He made
                    all the utensils of the altar, its fire hearth and its base and the
                    cups and the flesh forks which were of brass.                                                             He made for
                    the altar a grate, a piece of net work below the fire hearth about
                    half way up it ; and he put, on the four sides of the casing of
                    the altar, the four brass rings large enough for the poles with
                    which the altar is to be carried.
                           He made the holy anointing oil and the compound incense
                    the pure work of an apothecary.                                          He made the brass laver and
                    its base of brass out of the mirrors of the women who were
                    fasting at the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony on the
                    day it was set up.                         He made also the laver, that out of it Mo-
                    ses and Aaron and his sons might wash their hands and
                    their feet, when they went into the tabernacle of the testimony
                    or when they went to minister at the altar.                                                       They washed out
                    of it as the Lord commanded Moses.

        of the holy things was of the gold of the offering twenty nine
        talents and seven hundred shekels after the shekel of the sanc-
        tuary. And the silver was the offering of silver from the men
        of the congregation who were reviewed amounting to a hun-
        dred talents, and one thousand seven hundred and seventy five
        shekels being a drachm the half of a shekel after the holy she-
        kel for each head, all who passed the review from twenty years
        old and upwards being six hundred and three thousand five
        hundred and fifty. Now the hundred talents of silver were for
        casting the hundred capitals of the tabernacle including the
        capitals of the veil, a hundred capitals for the hundred talents,
       a talent for each capital.And the thousand seven hundred and
        seventy five shekels he wrought up into hooks for the pillars.
       And he gilded the capitals and ornamented them.      And the
       brass of the offering was seventy talents and a thousand five
       hundred shekels.  And of this they made the bases of the doors
       of the tabernacle of the testimony and the bases of the court
       round about and the bases of the gate of the court and the pins
       of the tabernacle and the pins of the court round about, and
       the brass casing of the altar and all the utensils of the altar,
       even all the works of the tabernacle of the testimony.
           And when the Israelites had compleated the workâ€”when
        they had compleated it in the manner the Lord had command-
        ed Moses, they then made up the rest of the gold of the offer-
       ing into vessels to be used in the holy service before the Lord.
        And what was left of the blue and purple and scarlet yarn
       they made up into sacerdotal garments for Aaron to minister
        in them, as a priest in the sanctuary. And they brought to
        Moses the robes and the tabernacle and the utensils thereof
        and its bases and bars and pilasters and the ark of the cove-
        nant with its staves, and the altar and all its utensils ; and the
        anointing oil, and the compound incense, and the pure candle-
        stick with its lamps, the lamps for burning oil and the oil for
        giving light, and the presence table and all its utensils, and
        the loaves to be laid on it, and the robes of the sanctuary ap-
        propriate to Aaron, and the robes of his sons to minister in as
        priests, and the hangings of the court and the pillars, and the
        curtain of the door of the tabernacle and of the gate of the
        court, and all the utensils of the tabernacle and all the imple-

          ments thereof, arid the upper coverings of rams' skins dyed
          red and the blue coverings, and the other coverings, and the
          pins and all the instruments for the service of the tabernacle of
          the testimony, which the Lord had commanded Moses.    And
          when the children of Israel had thus made all the furniture and
          Moses had viewed all the works and they had executed them
          and made them in the manner the Lord commanded Moses,
          Moses blessed them.
       XL.     Then the Lord spoke to Moses saying, On the first day
        2 of the first month it being then new moon, thou shalt rear up
          the tabernacle of the testimony and place therein the ark of the
        3 testimony and cover it with the veil.Then thou shalt carry
          in the table and set in order the service thereof.And thou shalt
        5 carry in the candlestick and place on it the lamps : and thou shalt
          set the golden altar, to burn incense, in its place before the
          ark ;and thou shalt hang up the covering curtain at the door
        6 of the tabernacle of the testimony.And the altar of homage
          offerings thou shalt place at the doors of the tabernacle of
          the testimony. Then thou shalt surround the tabernacle and
        9 hallow all the things belonging to it round about.For this
          purpose thou shalt take the anointing oil and anoint the taber-
          nacle and all the things in it and hallow it and all its utensils
       10 and they shall be holy.And thou shalt anoint the altar of ho-
          mage offerings and all its utensils and hallow the altar, and
       12 this altar shall be a holy of holies.Then thou shalt bring
          Aaron and his sons to the doors of the tabernacle of the testi-
       13 mony and wash them with water. And thou shalt put the holy
          robes on Aaron and anoint him and hallow him that he may mi-
       14 nister to me in the priest's office.Thou shalt then bring forward
          his sons and clothe them with vestures and anoint them as
       15 thou didst their father and they shall serve me as priests.And
          this unction of the priesthood shall belong to them forever
          throughout their generations.
       16    So Moses did all these things. Whatever the Lord com-
       17 manded him so did he.  Accordingly in the first month in the
          second year of their coming out of Egypt, at the new moon
      18 the tabernacle was reared up.And when Moses had reared up
          the tabernacle he put on the capitals and put in the bars and
       19 set up the pilasters and spread the curtains over the taberna-
     Ch. XL.                       EXODUS.
        cle and put over it the upper covering of the tabernacle as the
     20 Lord commanded Moses.        Then taking the testimonies he put
    21 them in the ark, and put the staves under the ark, and carried
        the ark into the tabernacle and hung up the covering of the
        veil and covered from view the ark of the testimony in the
    22 manner the Lord commanded Moses.             Then he placed the ta-
        ble in the tabernacle of the testimony, on the north side with
     23 out the veil of the tabernacle and set thereon the presence loaves
     24 before the Lord as the Lord commanded Moses.                Then he
        placed the candlestick in the tabernacle of the testimony on the
     25 south side of the tabernacle and put the lamps thereon before
    26 the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.            He then placed the
        golden altar in the tabernacle of the testimony over against the
     27 veil and burned thereon compound incense as the Lord com-
     29 manded Moses.      Then he placed the altar of homage offerings
     33 at the doors of the tabernacle and reared up the court around
     34 the tabernacle and the altar.       And when Moses had finished
        all these works the cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimo-
     35 ny, and the tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord so
        that Moses could not go into the tabernacle of the testimony,
        because the cloud overshadowed it and with the glory of the
         Lord the tabernacle was filled.
     36     Now when the cloud ascended from the tabernacle, the
    37 Israelites prepared to march with their baggage.            But if the
        cloud did not ascend they did not prepare to march till the day
     38 when the cloud ascended.      For there was a cloud on the taber-
        nacle by day and in the night there was a fire on it in the sight
         of all Israel throughout all their journeyings.

      I.     Then the Lord called up Moses and spoke to him out of
         the tabernacle of the testimony saying, Speak to the children
      2 of Israel and thou shalt say to them, When any man among
         you bringeth gifts to the Lord from your cattle, you shall
      3 bring them either from the flocks or the herds.         If his gift be
         a whole burnt offering from the herd, he shall bring a male
         without blemish to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
      4 He shall bring it before the Lord for acceptance; and he shall

                   lay his hand on the head of the homage offering to be accept-
               5 ed for himâ€”to make atonement for him.                                                  And they shall kill
                   the young bull before the Lord ; and the sons of Aaron the
                   priests shall carry the blood and pour it out round about on
               6 the altar which is at the doors of the tabernacle of the testimo-
                   ny ; and having flayed the whole burnt offering they shall cut
               7 it in quarters ; and the sons of Aaron the priests shall put the
               8 fire on the altar and pile wood on the fire ; and the sons of
                   Aaron the priests shall lay the quarters with the head and the
               9 suet on the wood which is on the fire on the altar ; and they
                   shall wash the entrails and the feet with water, and the priests
                   shall lay them all on the altar.                               It is an homage gift, a sacrifice,
                   a smell of fragrance for the Lord.
             10           And if his gift to the Lord be from the flocks, either from
                   the lambs or the kids for a whole burnt offering, he shall bring
             11a male without blemish and he shall lay his hands on its head
                   and they shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the
                   Lord : and the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall pour the blood
             12 on the altar round about ; then they shall cut it in quarters
                   and the priests shall lay these with the head and the suet on the
             13 wood which is on the fire on the altar ; and they shall wash the
                   entrails and the feet with water; and the priests shall carry
                   them all up and lay them on the altar.                                        It is an homage offer-
                   ing, a sacrifice, a smell of fragrance for the Lord.
             14           And if he bring an homage offering from among the fowls
                   as his gift to the Lord ; he shall bring his gift either from
             15 among the turtle doves or the pigeons ; and the priest shall
                   carry it to the altar and wring off the head, and the priest
             16 shall lay it on the altar ; then he shall squeeze out the blood
                   against the base of the altar ; and he shall take away the craw
                   with the feathers and throw it on the east side of the altar into
                   the ash hole, then he shall break it off from the wings but shall
             17 not divide it ; and the priest shall lay it on the altar, on the
                   wood which is upon the fire.                             It is an homage offering, a sacri-
                   fice, a smell of fragrance for the Lord.
             II.           And when any person shall bring a sacrificial gift to the
                    Lord, his gift shall be fine flour, and he shall pour oil on it
                2 and lay frankincense on it.                              It is a sacrifice ; and he shall car-
                    ry it to the sons of Aaron, the priests ; and the priest having
            2                                                                                                                                    ;

                taken out a handful of the flour with the oil, and all the frank-
            3 incense thereof shall lay this memorial of it on the altar.                                                               Tt is
                a sacrifice, a smell of fragrance for the Lord. And the rest of the
                sacrifice shall be for Aaron and his sons, a most holy portion
                from the sacrifices of the Lord.
            4          And if he bring a gift, a baked sacrifice from the oven, his
                 gift to the Lord shall be of fine flourâ€”he shall bring unleav-
                ened loaves tempered with oil or unleavened cakes anointed
            f)  with oil.              And if thy gift be a sacrifice from the pan, it must
            6 be of fine flour tempered with oil, without leaven.                                                             And hav-
                 ing broken it to pieces thou shalt crumble the fragments and
            7 pour oil thereon.                        It is a sacrifice to the Lord.                              And if thy gift
                 be a sacrifice from the hearth, the fine flour must be made up
            8 with oil.              And he shall bring the sacrifice which he hath pre-
                 pared of these materials for the Lord and carry it to the priest
            9 and the priest shall carry it near to the altar and shall take from
                 the sacrifice the memorial of it and lay it on the altar.                                                         It is an
                 homage offering, a smell of fragrance for the Lord ; and the
          10 rest of the sacrifice shall be for Aaron and his sons.                                                            These are
                 most holy portions from the homage offerings of the Lord.
          11 Every sacrifice which you bring to the Lord, you shall pre-
                 pare without leaven ; for you must not bring any kind of leaven,
          1      not even honey, as a gift to pay homage to the Lord.                                                           You may
                 bring them as gifts of first fruits to the Lord ; but they shall
                 not be laid on the altar for a smell of fragrance for the Lord.
          13            Every gift of your sacrifice must be seasoned with salt.
                 You shall not withhold the salt of the covenant of the Lord
                 from your sacrifices.                           With every gift you make, you shall
                 offer salt to the Lord your God.
          14            And when thou bringest a sacrifice of first fruits to the Lord,
          15 it must be young parched grains broken in the mill.                                                                   This sa-
                 crifice of the first fruits thou shalt offer to the Lord, and thou
                 shalt pour oil on it and put frankincense on it.                                                   It is a sacrifice.
           16 And the priest shall carry up as the memorial of it some of the
                  broken grains with all the frankincense.                                             Tt is an homage offer-
                  ing to the Lord.
           III.             And if his gift to the Lord be a sacrifice of thanksgiving,
                  and he bring it from the herd, whether it be a male or a female,
             2 he shall bring it without blemish before the Lord and shall lay

                his hands on the head of the gift and kill it before the Lord at
                the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony.                              And the sons of
                Aaron, the priests shall pour the blood on the altar of whole
             3 burnt offerings round about : And from the sacrifice of thanks-
                giving they shall offer up as an homage offering to the Lord
                the caul which covereth the belly and all the suet on the belly
             4 and the two kidneys with the suet on them, and that on the
                flanks, and with the kidneys he shall take off the lobe of the
            5 liver.       And the sons of Aaron, the priests shall offer up these
                on the altarâ€”on the whole burnt offerings which are on the
                wood on the fire.              It is an offering of homage, a smell of fra-
                grance for the Lord.
             6        And if his gift be a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Lord
                from the flock, whether it be a male or a female, he shall offer
            7 it without blemish.                If he bring a lamb as his gift he shall bring
            8 it before the Lord and lay his hands on the head of his gift and
                kill it at the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony, and the
                sons of Aaron the priest shall pour the blood on the altar round
             9 about.        And from the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer as
                an offering of homage to the Lord the fat tail and the whole
                loin which he shall take off with the rump ; and having taken
           10 off the caul which covereth the inwards and all the fat on the
                belly and the two kidneys with the suet on them and on the
                loin and the lobe of the liver with the kidneys the priest shall
           11 offer up these on the altar.                   It is a sweet savour, an offering of
                homage to the Lord.
           12        And if his gift be from the goats, he shall bring it before
           13 the Lord and lay his hands on its head,                             xlnd they shall kill it
                before the Lord at the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony
                                                                                                                   ;
                and the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall pour out the blood
           14 against the altar round about ; And from it he shall offer up as
                an offering of homage to the Lord the caul which covereth the
                belly and all the fat on the belly and both the kidneys and all
           15 the suet on them.                 That on the loins and the lobe of the liver
                he shall take off with the kidneys and the priest shall offer them
          16 on the altar.            It is an offering of homage, a smell of fragrance
                for the Lord.
          17         All the .suet for (lie Lord shall be an ordinance for ever
               throughout your generations.                      You shall not eat suet nor blood
               of any kind.
     Ck. IV.                     LEVITICUS.
     IV.       Again the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Speak to the chil-
      2 dren of Israel and say, When any person sinneth unwittingly
         before the Lord, and doth any of those things, which by any
      3 of the commandments of the Lord he ought not to doâ€”if for
         instance the chief priest who hath been anointed, sin ; on the
         accouut of his causing the people to sin, he shall, for the sin
         which he hath committed, bring a young bull without blemish
      4 from the herd before the Lord for his sin offering ; and having
         brought the young bull to the door of the tabernacle of the
         testimony before the Lord he shall lay his hand on the head
         of the young bull before the Lord and slay the bull in the pre-
      5 sence of the Lord; And the priest who is anointed, he whose
         hands have been consecrated, having taken some of the blood
         of the bull shall carry it into the tabernacle of the testimony.
      G And this priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle
         some of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the holy
      7 veil ; and he shall put some of the blood of the bull on the horns
         of the altar of compound incense, which is before the Lord in
         the tabernacle of the testimony.    Now all the blood of the bull
         he is to pour out at the base of the altar of whole burnt offer-
         ings which is at the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony.
      8 And with regard to all the suet of the bull for the sin offering,
         he shall strip off the caul, which covereth the entrails and all
       9 the fat on the entrails and the two kidneys with the suet on
         themâ€”that which is on the loins and the lobe which is on the
     10 liver he shall strip off with the two kidneys in the same man-
         ner as it is to be taken from the young bull of the sacrifice of
         thanksgiving ; and the priest shall offer up these upon the altar
     11 of homage offerings : but the skin of the bull and all his flesh
         with the head and the limbs and the belly and the dung even
     12 the whole bull they shall carry forth without the camp to a clean
         place where the ashes are emptied out, and burn him on wood
         with fire. On the out pourings of the ashes he shall be burned.
     13     And if the whole congregation of Israel be unwittingly ig-
         norant and a commandment hath escaped the notice of the
         whole congregation, and they shall do an act, which by any of
         the commandments of the Lord ought not to be done and shall
      14 transgress : when the sin which they have thereby committed
         is made known to them, the congregration shall bring a young
        Ch. IV.                         LEVITICUS.
            bull from the herd without blemish for their siu offering ; and
            when they have brought him to the doors of the tabernacle of
        15 the testimony, the elders of the congregation shall lay their
            hands on the head of the bull before the Lord and slay the
        10 bull before the Lord ; and the priest, the anointed one shall
            carry some of the blood of the bull into the tabernacle of the
        17 testimony ; and the priest shall dip his linger into some of the
            blood of the bull and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord
        1 S in front of the holy veil, and shall put some of the blood on
            the horns of the altar of compound incense which is before the
            Lord in the tabernacle of the testimony.            Now all the blood
            he is to pour out at the base of the altar of homage offerings
        19 which is at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.              Then
            he shall take off all the suet of the victim and carry it up upon
            the altar and shall do with this bull in the same manner as was
        20 done with the bull for the sin offering.           This being done the
            priest shall make atonement for them, and the sin shall be for-
        21 given them.      But they must carry forth the whole bull out of
            the camp and burn him as they did the former bull.             It is a sin
            offering of the congregation.
        22      And if the chief sin or do inadvertently any of those things
            which by the commands of the Lord his God ought not to be
        23 done and commit sin or trespass ; when the sin which he hath
            thereby committed is made known to him he shall bring as
        24 his gift a goat from the goats a male without blemish, and he
            shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and they shall kill it
            in the place where they kill the whole burnt offerings before
        25 the Lord.      It is a sin offering.    And the priest with his finger
            shall put some of the blood of this sin offering on the horns of
            the altar of whole burnt offerings.         Now all the blood thereof
            he is to pour out at the base of the altar of whole burnt offer-
        26 ings and he shall offer all the suet thereof on the altar as he did
            the suet of the sacrifice of thanksgiving.          So the priest shall
            make atonement for him because of the sins which he hath
            committed and it shall be forgiven him.
        27       And if any of the people of the land sin inadvertently by
            doing any of those things which by the commands of the Lord
        28 ought not to be done and shall transgress ; when the sin which
            he hath thereby committed is made known to him, he shall
                                                                                                                                                         ;:

         29 blemish for the sin which he hath committed and shall lay his
                hand on the head of the sin offering ; and they shall kill this
                she goat for his sin offering in the place where they kill the
         30 whole burnt offerings.                                   And the priest shall take some of the
                blood thereof with his finger and put it on the horns of the al-
         31 tar of whole burnt offerings.                                         Now all the blood thereof he is to
                pour out at the base of the altar.                                          And he shall strip off all the
                suet in the same manner as suet is stripped from a sacrifice of
                thanksgiving ; and the priest shall offer it on the altar for a
                smell of fragrance for the Lord.                                                So shall the priest make
         "'VI   atonement for him and he shall be forgiven.                                                        And if he bring a
                 sheep as his gift for his sin offering, he shall bring a ewe with-
         oo out blemish, and lay his hand on the head of the sin offering
                and they shall kill it in the place where they kill the whole burnt
         34 offerings ; and the priest having taken up with his finger some
                 of the bijod of the sin offering shall put it on the horns of the
                 altar of whole burnt offerings.                                        Now all the blood thereof he
         35 is to pour out at the base of the altar of whole burnt offerings
                 and he shall strip off' all its suet in the same manner as the
                 suet is stripped from the sheep for a sacrifice of thanksgiving
                                                                                                                                                         ;
                 and the priest shall lay it on the altar on the whole burnt offer-
                 ing of the Lord.                           So shall the priest make atonement lor him
                 and he shall be forgiven.
          V.               And when any person shall sin inadvertentlyâ€”now should
                 one be adjured and being a witness hath either seen or known,
            2 if he do not tell, he will contract that sin ; or if any person
                 touch any unclean thing, either a corpse, or the unclean prey
                 of wild beasts, or the carcases of unclean abominations, or the
            3 carcases of unclean beasts, or shall touch any impurity of
                 manâ€”any of his impurities by the touching of which one
                 would be defiled, and it escaped his notice and he hath after-
            4 wards come to the knowledge of it ; or if a person be a trans-
                  gressor, either pronouncing with his lips to do evil ; or to do
                  good according to all that the man might pronounce with an
                  oath and it hath escaped his notice ; when he hath come to the
                  knowledge of his having inadvertently sinned in any of these
             .j   cases, he shall confess his sin in respect to whatever he hath
             (J   sinned ; and for trespassing against the Lord, for the sin which
                                                                                                                              ;
           Ch. V.                                        LEVITICUS.
                 he hath sinned, he shall bring a female from the flock either a
                 lamb or a kid of the goats for a sin offering ; and the priest
                 shall make atonement for him for the sin which he hath sinned
             7 and the sin shall be forgiven him.                                  And if he is not able to
                 fnrnish a larnb, he shall bring for the trespass which he hath
                 committed two turtle doves or two young pigeons to the Lord,
                 one for a sin offering and the other for a whole burnt offering :
             8 and he shall carry them to the priest and the priest shall offer
                 that for the sin offering, first.                     And the priest shall wring off its
             9 head from the neck, but shall not divide it ; and he shall sprin-
                 kle some of the blood of that which is for a sin offering on the
                 side of the altar and squeeze out the rest of the blood on the
            10 base of the altar.                 It is a sin offering.                 Then he shall offer the
                 other as an offering of homage in the usual manner.                                             So shall
                 the priest make atonement for him for the sin which he hath
            11 committed and it shall be forgiven him.                                      But if his hand can-
                 not find a pair of doves or two young pigeons, then he shall
                 bring as his gift for the sin which he hath committed the tenth
                  of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering.                               Upon this he shall
                  not pour oil, nor shall he lay incense on it, because it is a sin
            12 offering.           And he shall bring it to the priest; and the priest
                  having taken his handful from it shall lay this memorial of it
            13 on the altar of whole burnt offerings for the Lord.                                             It is a sin
                  offering.         So shall the priest make atonement for him, for the
                  sin which he hath committed and it shall be forgiven him.
                  And what is left shall be for the priest, as the sacrifice of fine
                  flour.
            14          Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses saying, If a person
                  through inadvertence hath forgotten or been unwittingly defi-
            15 cient in any of the holy things of the Lord ; when he shall bring
                  for his trespass against the Lord a ram without blemish from
                  the flock, thou must estimate in silver shekels, by the shekel
                  of the sanctuary, the value of that in respect to which he hath
             16 trespassed, and he shall pay the amount of the deficiency of
                  which he hath been guilty, and shall add thereto a fifth and give
                  it to the priest ; and the priest shall make atonement for him with
                  the trespass ram and he shall be forgiven.                                     So with respect to
                   every person, who may have sinned ; when he shall do any of
                   those things, which by any of the commands of the Lord ought
     Ck. VI.                            LEVITICUS.
          not to be done, and did not knowâ€”if he hath trespassed and
      18 contracted guilt ; when he shall bring a ram without blemish
          from the flock, thou must fine him in money before the priest
          to the amount of the trespass ; and the priest shall make atone-
          ment for him, for the ignorance of which he was guilty, though
      19 he did not know ; and he shall be forgiven ; for he hath been
          guilty of a trespass in the sight of the Lord.
      VI.       Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses saying, With regard
       2 to the person who shall sin, and who, utterly disregarding the
          commands of the Lord, shall lie to his neighbour touching a
          deposit, or touching any thing which he might use in common,
          or touching any thing made a prey of, whether he hath de-
       3 frauded his neighbour in any respect, or hath found what was
          lost, and shall lie concerning it ; or hath sworn falsely in respect
          to any of the things which he may have done, so as thereby to
       4 commit sin ; when he who hath thus sinned and transgressed
          hath restored the thing wrongfully taken, or that which he hath
          got unjustly, or the deposit which was committed to his trust,
       5 or the thing lost which he hath found ; then for every thing
          about which he hath sworn falsely he shall pay as a fine to the
           same amount, and add thereto a fifth.               To him whose it is he
           shall make restoration on the day he is convicted.                   And when
        (3 for his trespass he shall bring for the Lord a ram from the flock
           without blemish, thou must fine him to the amount of his tres-
        7 pass.    Then the priest shall make atonement for him before
           the Lord ; and he shall be forgiven for every of those things
           which he hath done, and by which he hath trespassed.
        8      Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Give a charge to
           Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the whole
        9 burnt offering.         The whole burnt offering must be burn-
           ing on the altar the whole night until the morning, and the fire
           of the altar must be kept burning thereon. It must not be extin-
       10 guished. Then the priest shall put on a linen vesture, and around
           his body he shall put on linen drawers ; and he shall take away
           the ashes, into which the fire hath consumed the whole burnt
       11 offering, from the altar, and lay them near the altar.                   Then he
           shall put off' liis rube, and put on another robe, and he shall car-
       12 ry forth the ashes without the camp to a clean place.                    And the
           fire on the altar shall be kept burning from itself, and shall not
                VOL. I.                           y
        Ch. VI                      LEVITICUS.
           be extinguished.     And the priest shall kindle wood upon it
           every morning, and shall lay the whole burnt offering in order
           upon it ; and upon it he shall lay the suet of the offerings of
       13 thanksgiving. So the fire shall be kept burning continually, and
           shall not be extinguished.
       14      This is the law of the sacrifice of flour, which the sons of
       15 Aaron shall offer before the Lord, in front of the altar.     Having
           taken from it his handful of the flour of the sacrifice, with the oil
           of it, and all the frankincense which is on the sacrifice, he shall
           lay this memorial of it on the altar as an offering of homage, a
       16 smell of fragrance for the Lord.       And what is left of it Aaron
           and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten without leaven in a holy
           place.   They shall eat it in the court of the tabernacle of the
       17 testimony.     It shall not be baked with leaven.     This portion I
           have given them from the homage offerings of the Lord.          It is
           most holy, as is that of the sin offering, and as is that of the
       18 trespass offering.    Every male among the priests shall eat it.
           It shall be an everlasting ordinance throughout your genera-
           tions, in respect to the homage offerings of the Lord, whoever
           shall touch them shall be hallowed.
        19     Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, This is the
       20 gift of Aaron and his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord,
           on the day when thou shalt anoint him, the tenth of the ephah
           of fine flour for a continual sacrificeâ€”the half of it in the morn-
       21 ing, and the half of it in the evening.      It shall be prepared in
           a pan with oil.   Being mixed up, he shall offer it in rolls, as a
           sacrifice of fragments, for a smell of fragrance for the Lord.
        22 The priest who is anointed, that one of his sons who is to suc-
           ceed him shall prepare it.       This is an everlasting ordinance,
        23 Let it he all consumed.    Indeed every sacrifice of a priest must
           be wholly burned.     It shall not be eaten.
        24     Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to Aaron
           and his sons, and say, This is the law of the Sin offering.
        25 Wherever they kill the whole burnt offering, there they shall
            kill the sin offerings before the Lord.      They are most holy.
        26 The priest who carrieth it up shall eat it in a holy place.        It
            shall be eaten in the court of the tabernacle of the testimony.
        27 Every one who toucheth the flesh of it shall be hallowed.       And
            if any of the blood of it shall be sprinkled on any one's gar-
        Cli. VII.                                     LEVITICUS.
             inent, he who is sprinkled therewith shall be washed in a holy
        28 place.          And if it be boiled in an earthen vessel, the vessel shall
              be broken           but if it be boiled in a brasen vessel, they must
                                ;
        29 scour it and rinse it with water.                          Every male among the priests
        30 shall eat thereof.                It is most holy to the Lord.                      But none of the
              sin offerings, some of the blood of which hath been carried into
              the tabernacle of the testimony, to make an atonement in the
              sanctuary, shall be eaten.                    They must be burned with fire.
        VII.           And this is the law of the ram for a trespass offering.                                         It
          2 is most holy.                In the place where they kill the whole burnt
              offerings, they shall kill the ram for a trespass offering before
              the Lord; and his blood shall be poured on the base of the
          3 altar all around : and of it shall be offered up the whole fat tail,
              and loin, and all the caul which covereth the entrails, and all the
          4 suet on the entrails, and the two kidneys with the suet on them.
              That on the loins, and the lobe which is on the liver, shall be
          5 stript off with the kidneys.                       And the priest shall carry them up
          6 upon the altar as an offering of homage to the Lord.                                                It is a
              trespass offering.              Every male among the priests shall eat there-
          7 of.       They shall eat it in a holy place.                            It is most holy.              As is
              the sin offering, so is the trespass offering.                                 There is one law
              for both : The priest who shall make atonement with it shall
          8 have it.            And the priest who offereth any man's whole burnt
              offering shall have the skin of the whole burnt offering which
          9 he offereth.              And every sacrifice of flour which shall be pre-
              pared in the oven, and every one which shall be baked on the
        10 hearth, or in a pan, shall be the priest's who offereth it : and
              every sacrifice of flour, whether made up with oil or not, shall
              be for all the sons of Aaron, for one as much as another.
        11          This is the law of the sacrifice of thanks*/icing which they
        12 shall offer to the Lordâ€”If one offereth it for praise, he shall
              bring with the sacrifice of praise loaves of fine flour make up
              with oil, and unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and fine flour
        13 tempered with oil.                    With loaves of leavened bread he shall pre-
              sent these gifts of his for a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving ;
              and from every of these gifts of his he shall set apart one, and
        14 present it as a dedication to the Lord.                                It shall be for the priest
              who poureth out the blood of the victim offered for thanks-
         15 giving.           And the flesh of the victim of praise and thanksgiving
       Ch. VII.                            LEVITICUS.
            sliall be for himself, and shall be eaten on the day it is offered.
       16 They shall not leave any of it till the morning.                      And if it be a
            vow ; or if one offer his gift as a voluntary sacrifice, it shall be
            eaten on the day he offereth his sacrifice, or the next morning.
       17 And what is left of the flesh of the sacrifice till the third day
       18 shall be burned with fire.              And if any one eat of the flesh on
            the third day, it shall not be accepted for him who offereth it.
            It shall not be placed to his account.                   It is an abomination.
       19 Whoever shall eat it shall contract guilt.                     If any flesh touch
           any unclean thing, it shall not be eaten.                     It shall be burned
       20 with fire.       Every person who is clean may eat flesh.                       But if
            any person shall eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of thanksgiv-
            ing, which is the Lord's, with his uncleanness upon him, that
       21 person shall be cut off from among his people.                               And the
           person who shall touch any unclean thing, whether it be the
           uncleanness of a man, or of unclean beasts, or any unclean
            abomination, and shall eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of thanks-
           giving, which is the Lord's, that person shall be destroyed from
            among his people.
       22       Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the

       24 nor of sheep, nor of goats.                 The suet of beasts which die of
            themselves, or which are torn by wild beasts, may be used for
       25 any kind of work ; but shall not be eaten for food.                          Whoever

       28        The Lord also spoke to Moses, saying, Thou shalt speak
       29 to the children of Israel, and say, He who offereth a sacrifice of
            thanksgiving shall bring his gift to the Lord ; and from the
       30 sacrifice of thanksgiving his own hands shall present, as his offer-

            lobe of the liver.        These he shall present that they may be laid
       31 before the Lord as a gift.             And the priest shall offer up the suet
            on the altar ; and the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons.

            and set apart for the priest, from your sacrifices of thanksgiving.

       33 That one of the sons of Aaron who ofifereth the blood of the
             thank offering, and the suet, shall have the right shoulder for his
       34 portion.          For the breast which is dedicated by being laid upon
             hands, and the shoulder which is dedicated by being set apart,
             I have taken from the children of Israelâ€”from your sacrifices
             of thanksgiving ; and have given them to Aaron the priest and
             his sons.       It is an everlasting due from the children of Israel.
       35 This is the unction of Aaron and the unction of his sons, the
             reward assigned them from the homage offerings of the Lord,
             on the day he took them into his house to minister to the Lord
       36 in the priest's office ; and which the Lord commanded to be
             given them on the day he anointed them from among the chil-
             dren of Israel, as an everlasting due throughout their genera-
             tions.
       37         This is the law of the whole burnt offering and the sacri-
            fice of flour, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering
            and of the consecration offering and of the sacrifice of ihanks-
       38 giving, as the Lord commanded Moses at mount Sina, on the
            day when he commanded the children of Israel to bring their
             gifts before the Lord in the wilderness of Sina.
       VIII.           Then the 'Lord spoke to Moses saying, Take Aaron
         2 and his sons, and his robes and the anointing oil, and the youn^
            bull for the sin offering, aud the two rams, and the basket of
         3 unleavened cakes ; and assemble all the congregation at the
         4 door of the tabernacle of the testimony.                                And Moses did as
            the Lord commanded him.                        And when he had assembled the
         5 congregation at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, Mo-
            ses said to the congregation, This is the thing which the Lord
         6 hath commanded to be done.                            Then Moses brought forward
         7 Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.                                         Then he
            arrayed him with the vesture, and girded him with the o-ircQe
            and put on him the under                                                                           7
                                                      robe, and over it he put on the ephod,
            and girded him with the girdle of the same fabrick as the ephod,
         8 and bound him up tight with it, and put on it the oracle ; and
         9 upon the oracle he put the manifestation and the truth.                                      Then
            he put the mitre on his head; and on the mitre, on the front
            of it, he put the golden plate, the holy sanctified jewel as the
       10 Lord commanded Moses.                            Then Moses took some of the
       11 anointing oil, and sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times
           \IU.                     LEVITICUS.
      Oh.
          and anointed the altar, and hallowed it and all its appurtenances,
          and the laver and its base.      And when he had hallowed them
          he anointed the tabernacle, and all the utensils thereof, and hal-
      12 lowed it.     Then Moses poured some of the anointing oil on
      13 the head of Aaron.      And when he had anointed him, and hal-
          lowed him, then Moses brought forward the sons of Aaron,
          and arrayed them with vestures, and girded them with girdles,
          and put tiaras on them, as the Lord commanded Moses.
      14      Then Moses brought forward the young bull for the sin
          offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head
      15 of the young bull for the sin offering ; and he slew it, and Mo-
          ses took some of the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar
          round about with his finger, and purified the altar.          Then he
          poured out the blood on the base of the altar.          And when he
      1(3 had hallowed it to make an atonement upon it, then Moses
          took all the suet on the entrails, and the lobe which is on the
          liver, and both the kidneys with the suet on them, and car-
      17 ried them up upon the altar ; but the bull, and his hide, and his
          flesh, and his dung, these he caused to be burned with fire with-
          out the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.
      18      Then Moses brought forward the ram which was for a
          whole burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands
      19 on the head of the ram ; and Moses slew the ram, and poured
      20 the blood against the altar round about.          And having divided
          the ram into quarters, Moses carried up the head, and the pieces,
      21 and the suet.     Then having washed the belly and the feet with
          water, Moses carried up the whole ram upon the altar.           It is a
          whole burnt offering for a smell of fragranceâ€”an offering of
          homage to the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
      22      Then Moses brought forward the other ram, which was
          for a consecration offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their
      23 hands on the head of this ram, and he slew it.        And Moses took
          some of the blood thereof, and put it on the tip of Aaron's right
          ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe
      24 of his right foot.      Then Moses brought forward the sons of
          Aaron, and put some of the blood on the tips of their right
          ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the great
          toes of their right feet.    He then poured the blood against the
      25 altar round about.     And he took the tail, and the loin, and the
                                                                â€”

        suet on the belly, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys
        with the suet on them, and the right shoulder ; and from the
     26 basket of the consecration offering, which was before the Lord,
        he took one unleavened loaf, and one loaf of oil bread, and one
     27 cake, and laid them on the suet and the right shoulder, and put
        them all on the hands of Aaron, and on the hands of his sons,
        and caused them to be lifted up as a dedication before the Lord.
     28 Then Moses took them from their hands, and carried them up
        upon the altarâ€” on the consecration whole burnt offering,
     29 which is for a smell of fragrance.It is an offering of homage
        to the Lord. Then having taken the breast, Moses set this, which
        had been laid on hands before the Lord, apart from the ram of
        the consecration offering.And it was Moses' portion, as the
        Lord commanded Moses.
    30     Then Moses took some of the anointing oil, and some of
        the blood which was by the altar, and sprinkled them on Aaron
        and his robes, and on his sons and their robes with him.And
        when he had hallowed Aaron and his robes, and his sons and
    31 their robes with him, then Moses said to Aaron and his sons,
        Boil this flesh in the court of the tabernacle of the testimony,
        in a holy place, and eat it there with the bread which is in the
        basket of the consecration offering, as it hath been given me
    32 in charge, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat these. And
        what is left of the flesh, and of the bread, you must burn with
    33 fire. And from the door of the tabernacle of the testimony you
        shall not depart for seven days, until the day be compleated
        the day of your consecration ; for he will consecrate your hands
     34 seven days, as he hath done this very day, in which the Lord
        hath commanded me to do this in order to make an atonement
     35 for you. You shall therefore continue seven days at the door
        of the tabernacle of the testimony.Day and night you shall
        keep the watches of the Lord, that you may not die ; for so the
        Lord GJ-od hath commanded me.
     36    And when Aaron and his sons had done all that the Lord
     IX.    commanded Moses, On the eighth day Moses called Aaron
        and his sons, and the senate of Israel, and Moses said to Aaron,
      2 Take for thyself a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a
        ram for a whole burnt offering, both without blemish (Now
      3 he had brought them before the Lord) and speak to the senate
           IX.                      LEVITICUS.
       Ch.
          of Israel saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering,
          and a calf and a lamb of the first year for an homage offering,
        â€¢1all without blemish, and a young bull and a ram for a sacrifice
          of thanksgiving before the Lord, and fine flour tempered with
        5 oil ; for to-day the Lord will appear among you.           And when
          they had brought them, as Moses commanded, over against
          the tabernacle of the testimony, and all the congregation were
        6 come, and stood before the Lord, Moses said, This is the thing
          which the Lord hath commanded ; do it, and the glory of the
        7 Lord will appear among you.         Then Moses said to Aaron, Go
          near to the altar, and offer thy own sin offering, and thy own
          burnt offering, and make atonement for thyself and thy house,
          then offer the gifts of the people, and make atonement for them,
        8 as the Lord commanded Moses.          Accordingly Aaron went near
          to the altar, and slew the calf for his own sin offering, and the
        9 sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he dipped his
      10 finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and
          having poured out the blood on the base of the altar, he carried
          up the suet, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver, of the sin
      11 offering, upon the altar as the Lord commanded Moses, and
          the flesh and the skin he caused to be burned with fire with-
          out the camp.
      12      Then he slew the whole burnt offering, and the sons of Aaron
          brought him the blood, and he poured it out against the altar
      13 round about.     Then they presented the whole burnt offering by
      14 pieces, and these and the head he laid on the altar.          He then
          washed the belly and the feet with water, and laid them on the
          whole burnt offering on the altar.
      15      Then he brought forward the gift of the people, and he took
          the goat for the sin offering of the people, and slew it, and pu-
       16 rifled it as he had done the first.   He then brought forward the
          whole burnt offering, and did with it in the manner prescribed.
       17 Then, presenting the sacrifice of flour, he filled his hands with
          some of it, and laid the handful on the altar apart from the
       18 morning whole burnt offering.
              Then he slew the young bull and the ram for the people's
          sacrifice of thanksgiving ; and the sons of Aaron brought him
          the blood ; and he poured it out against the altar round about.
       19 And the suet of the bull and that of the ram with the loin and the

      Oh.
         caul which covereth the belly, and the two kidneys with the
         suet on them, and the lobe of the liverâ€”the several parcels of
     20 suet he laid on the breast, and having carried up the suet upon
     21 the altar, Aaron took away the breast and the right shoulder as
         a portion set apart before the Lord, as the Lord commanded
         Moses.
            Then Aaron, lifting up his hands over the people, blessed
     22 themâ€”When he came down from offering the sin offering, and
     23 the whole burnt offerings, and the offerings of thanksgiving, and
         Closes and Aaron had gone into the tabernacle of the testimo-
         ny, and come out and blessed all the people, then the glory of
     24 the Lord appeared to all the people, and there came forth a fire
         from the Lord which consumed what were on the altar, both
         the whole burnt offerings and the parcels of suet.    And when
         all the people saw this, they were struck with consternation and
                                   and the two sons of Aaron, Nadab and
     X.        fell on their faces ;
         Abiud, having taken each his censer, laid fire on it, and threw
         incense thereon, and presented before the Lord strange fire,
      2 which the Lord had not ordered them; upon which a fire
         darted forth from the Lord, and destroyed them, and they died
      3 before the Lord.    Whereupon Moses said to Aaron, This is
         what the Lord spoke, saying, I will be hallowed by them who
         come near me, and glorified by all the congregation ; and Aaron
      4 was pierced with anguish.       Then Moses called Misado and
         Elisaphan, the sons of Oziel, the sons of Aaron's uncle, and
        said to them, Go near and carry out your brethren from before
      5 the holies, out of the camp.  So they wentnear, and carried them,
      6 in their vestures, out of the camp, as Moses ordered.       Then
        Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar, and Ithamar, his surviving
         sons, Uncover not your heads, nor rend your garments, lest
         you die, and wrath come on the whole congregation: but let
         your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail this burning with
      7 which the Lord hath burned them.      But you must not go from
        the door of the tabernacle of the testimony lest you die ; for the
        anointing oil of the Lord is upon you.     So they did according
        to the command of Moses.
      8     And the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying, Thou, and thy suns
      9 with thee, must not drink wine nor strong drink, when you
        come into the tabernacle of the testimony, or when you ap-
            vol. I.                    z

         Ch.
               proach the altar, lest you die.                         It is your everlasting privilege,
         10 throughout your generations, to distinguish between holy things
               and things unholy, and between clean and unclean things, and
         11 to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord
               hath delivered them by the ministration of Moses.
          12           Then Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar, and Ithamar,
               the sons of Aaron, who were left, Take the sacrifice of flour
               which was left from the homage offerings of the Lord, and eat
          13 the unleavened bread near the altar.                                It is most holy ; therefore
                you must eat it in a holy place ; for this is thy due, and thy sons
                due, from the homage offerings of the Lord : for so it hath been
          14 given me in charge.                       The dedicated breast, and the dedicated
                shoulder, which are set apart, you shall eat in a holy place, thou,
                and thy sons, and thy household with thee, for it hath been given
                thee as thy due, and to thy sons as their due from the thank of-
          15 ferings of the children of Israel.                             The dedicated shoulder, and
                the dedicated breast, they shall offer on the homage offerings
                of suet, to be set apart as a dedication before the Lord; and
                they shall be for thee, and for thy sons, and for thy daughters
                with thee, an everlasting due, as the Lord commanded Moses.
          16          Now when Moses made diligent search for the goat of the
                sin offering, and behold it was burned, Moses was angry with
                Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, and said,
          1     Why did you not eat the sin offering in a holy place ? for be-
                cause it is most holy, he hath given this to you to eat, that you
                may take away the sin of the congregation, and make atonement
          18 for them before the Lord ; for none of its blood was carried into
                the sanctuary.              You should have eaten it publicly in the court,
          19 in a holy place, as the Lord commanded me.                                          Upon this Aaron
                spoke to Moses, saying, Though they have this day brought
                their sin offerings and their whole burnt offerings before the
                Lord         yet such things having befallen me, had I this day eaten
                          ;
                their sin offering, would it have been well pleasing to the Lord ?
           20 Upon hearing this Moses was satisfied with him.
           XL            Again the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, Speak
             2 to the children of Israel, and say, Among all the beasts which
             3 are on the earth, these are the beasts which you may eat.                                            Every
                 beast having a double hoof, its hoof parted into two distinct
                 hoofs, and bringing up the cud, these among the beasts you

      4 may eat.   But of these you shall not eatâ€”of those which chew
        the cud, and of those which have parted hoofsâ€”the camel,
      5 though it cheweth the cud ; yet because it hath not a parted
        hoof, it is unclean to you ; the hairy foot, though it cheweth
        the cud, yet because it hath not a parted hoof, it is unclean to
      6 you ; and the choirogryllus, though it cheweth the cud, yet be-
      7 cause it hath not a parted hoof, it is unclean to you ; and the
        swine, though it hath a parted hoof, yet because it doth not chew
      8 the cud, it is unclean to you.  Of the flesh of these you shall

        clean to you.
      9     And these are what you may eat of all that are in the wa-
        ters : all that have fins and scales, in the waters or in the seas,
     10 or in the brooks, these you may eat ; but all that have not
        fins and scales in the waters, and in the seas, and in the brooks,
        of all the multitudes which the waters produce, and of all the
        living creatures in the waters, are an abomination, and shall be
     11 an abomination to you.     Of their flesh you shall not eat; and
     12 their dead carcases you shall abominate.     All in the waters
        which have not fins and scales are an abomination to you.
     lo     And among the birds, these are what you must abominate,
        and which shall not be eaten ; they are an abomination ; the
        eagle, and the ospray, and the cormorant, and the vulture, and
        the kite and all of its kind, and the ostrich, and the owl, and
        the gull and all of its kind, and crows of all sorts and their kind,

        the swan, and the heron, and the charadrius and all of its kind,
        and the puet, and the bat.
     20     All the flying reptiles also which walk on four feet are
     21 abominations to you : but of the flying reptiles which walk on
        four feet, you may eat those which have legs above their feet
     22 to hop with them on the ground.     These of them in particular
         you may eat, the brouchus-locust and its species, and the al-
         take-locust and all its species, and the serpent-fighter and all
     23 its species, and the grasshopper and all its species. Every fly-
         ing reptile which hath four feet is an abomination to you.
     24 With them you must not defile yourselves.     Whosoever touch-

         any of their carcases shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until
     29 the evening.  These are unclean to you. And of the reptiles

     30 the mouse, and the lizzard, and the toad, and the chamelion, and
     31 the spicier, and the rat, and the mole.These are unclean to
        you above all the reptiles which are on the earth.Whoever
        toucheth them when dead, shall be unclean until the evening.
     32 And upon whatsoever any of them, when dead, shall fall, it shall
        be unclean ; whether it be a vessel of wood, or a garment, or a
        sack, every utensil in which any work is done shall be plunged
        in water, and shall be unclean until evening.Then it shall be
     33 clean.  And if any of them fall into a vessel made of clay, all
     34 that is in it shall be unclean, and it shall be broken ; and every
        kind of meat which is eatable, upon which water out of it shall
        come, shall be unclean ; and every kind of drink which may be
     35 drunk in every such earthen vessel shall be unclean.  And
        every thing upon which any of their dead carcases may fall
        shall be unclean. Ovens, and stands for pots, shall be broken
     36 down : theyare unclean, and shall be unclean to you.Butfoun-

     37 And he who toucheth their carcases shall be unclean.If any
        of their carcases fall on seed which is to be sown it shall be
     38 clean. But if water hath been poured on any kind of grain, and
        any of their carcases fall upon it, it shall be unclean to you.
     39    Now if any of those beasts which you may lawfully eat
        should happen to die, he who toucheth their dead carcases shall
     40 be unclean until evening.  And he who eateth of their car-
        cases shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening.
        And he who carrieth any of their carcases shall wash his clothes,
        and wash himself with water, and be unclean until evening.

               may be eaten, and the viviparous which are not to be eaten.
         XII.           Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the
           2 children of Israel, and say unto them, When a woman hath
               conceived, and brought forth a male, she shall be unclean seven
               days.         During her days of separation for her lying in she shall
           3 be unclean.                 And on the eighth day she shall circumcise the
           4 flesh of his foreskin, and continue thirty three days in her im-

               come to the sanctuary, until the days of her purification be
           5 compleated.                 But if she hath brought forth a female, she shall
               be unclean twice seven days for her lying in, and shall con-
           6 tinue sixty six days in her impurity.                                          And when the days of
               her purification are compleated, either for a son or a daughter,
               she shall bring a lamb of the first year, without blemish, for a
               whole burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle dove,
               for a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the testimo-

               shall make atonement for her, and purify her from the issue of
           8 her blood.                This is the law touching her who beareth a male
                or a female child.                  But if she be not in circumstances to furnish
               a lamb, she shall take two turtle doves, or two young pigeons,
                one for a whole burnt offering, and one for a sin offering, and

           XIII.            Again the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, If
             2 any man hath, on the outer coat of the skin, a remarkable
                 swelling, very white, and there be a touch of the leprosy
                 on the outer coat of his skin, he shall be brought to
             â€¢') Aaron the veriest, or to one of his sons, the priests: and the
                 priest shall look at the touch on the outer coat of his skin ; and
                 if the hair in the touch be turned white, and the appearance of
                 the touch be deeper than the outer skin, it is a touch of the
                 leprosy.           And when the priest shall see this, he shall pronounce
            4 him unclean.                    But though the whiteness be exceedingly bright
                 on the outer coat of the skin, if the appearance of it be not
                 deeper than the outer coat, and the hair thereof be not turned
            5 white, but is of a duskish colour ; the priest shall set apart the
                 patient seven day.                      And on the seventh day the priest shall
                 view the touch; and if the touch still remaineth before him,
                 but hath not spread on the outer skin, the priest shall set him
            6 apart seven days more.                                And on the seventh day the priest
                 shall look on him again, and if the touch be languid, and hath
                 not spread on the outer skin, the priest shall pronounce him
            7 clean ; for it is but a mark.                                 And having washed his clothes,
                 he shall be clean.                     But if* the mark on the outer skin shall
                 change, and spread, after the priest viewed him for the purpose
            8 of pronouncing him clean, he shall again appear before the
                 priest, and the priest shall view him; and if the mark hath
                 spread on the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean.                                                          It
            9 is a leprosy.                 And when any man hath a touch of the leprosy,
          10 he shall come to the priest ; and the priest shall view it : and
                 if there be a white swelling on the outer skin, and it hath
          11 changed the hair, and there be some raw flesh in the swelling,
                 it is an inveterate leprosy in the outer skin of the flesh, and the
                 priest shall pronounce him unclean, and set him apart, for he is
          12 unclean.                But if the leprosy hath formed an efflorescence on
                 the outer skin, and covered the whole skin of the patient from
                 head to foot, wherever the priest looketh : and the priest shall
          13 look and see that the leprosy hath covered the whole skin of
          14 the flesh, the priest shall pronounce him clean.                                                Because it hath
                 turned all white it is clean.                            But whenever raw flesh appeareth
           15 on him he shall become unclean.                                      When the priest shall see the

     Ch.
         raw flesh, that raw flesh shall announce him unclean ; for he
     16 is unclean.    It is a leprosy.   But if the raw flesh stop, ami turn
     17 white, he shall come to the priest.        And when the priest shall
         look, and see that the touch is turned white, the priest shall
     18 pronounce him clean.       In regard to the touch he is clean.       And
     19 if the flesh at the outer skin hath been a boil, and healed, and in
         the place of the boil there be a white swelling of a very shin-
     20 ing whiteness or redness, he shall appear before the priest; and
         when the priest shall see that the appearance is deeper than the
         outer skin, and that the hair is changed white, the priest shall
         pronounce him unclean, for it is a leprosy ; it hath broken out
     21 in the boil. But if the priest shall see that there is no white hair
         in it, and that it is not deeper than the outer skin, and the hair
         is of a duskish colour, the priest shall set him apart seven days.
     22 And if it actually spread on the skin, the priest shall pronounce
         him unclean.     It is a touch of the leprosy.      It hath broken out
     23 in the boil.    But if the brightness continueth in its place and is
         not spread ; it is the effect of the boil and the priest shall pro-
     24 nounce him clean.       And if the flesh hath been a burn of lire,
         and the burn when healed become remarkably splendent,
     2.*>whitish, reddish, or very white, the priest shall view it : and if
         the white hair hath changed to a shining whiteness, and the ap-
         pearance is deeper than the skin, it is a leprosy.      It hath broken
         out in the burn.     So the priest shall pronounce him unclean.        It
     26 is a touch of the leprosy.      But if the priest see that there is no
         white hair in the bright spot, and that it is not deeper than the
         skin, but is of a brownish colour, the priest shall set him apart
     27 seven days ; and on the seventh day the priest shall view him ;
         and if it hath actually spread on the skin, the priest shall pro-
         nounce him unclean.        It is a touch of the leprosy.        It hath
     28 broken out in the blister.      But if the shining spot remaineth in
         its place, and hath not spread on the skin, and the hair be of a
         brownish colour, it is the effect of the burn, and the priest shall
     29 pronounce him clean ; for it is the scar of the burn.             And if
     30 any man or woman hath a touch of the leprosy in the head or
         on the chin, the priest shall view the touch ; and if he perceive
         that the appearance of the touch is deeper than the skin, and
         that the hair in it is thin, and of a yellowish colour, the priest
         shall pronounce the person unclean.         It is a scald, a leprosy of
                                                                                                                  ;;

          31 the head, or a leprosy of the chin.                        But if the priest, upon view-
                ing the touch of the scald, see that the appearance of it is not
                deeper than the skin, and that the hair in it is not of a yellowish
                colour, the priest shall set apart the person who hath the touch
          32 of the scald, seven days.                    And on the seventh day the priest
               shall view the touch ; and if the scald hath not spread, and
               there be no yellowish hair in it, and the appearance of the scald
          33 is not deeper than the skin ; then the skin must be shaved
               but the scald must not be shaved, and the priest shall set apart
          34 the scald seven days more.                        And on the seventh day, if the
               priest, upon viewing the scald see that the scald hath not spread
               on the skin after the patient was shaved, and that the appear-
               ance of the scald is not deeper than the skin, the priest shall
               pronounce him clean ; and, having washed his clothes, he shall
          35 be clean.          But if the scald spread on the skin after the person
          36 hath been pronounced clean, and the priest, upon viewing it,
               shall see that the scald hath spread on the skin, the priest shall
               examine no farther about the yellow hair, for he is unclean.
          37 But, if upon his viewing it, the scald continueth in its place, and
               the black hair grow in it, the scald is healed. He is clean, and the
         38 priest shall pronounce him clean.                           And if any man or woman
               hath shining spots on the skin of the flesh, of a shining white-
         39 ness ; and the priest, upon viewing it, see in the skin of the flesh
               spots of a shining whiteness, it is a kind of leucophlegmacy
         40 it springeth up in the skin of the flesh ; he is clean.                                And if any
               person's head shed its hair, though he be bald he is clean.                                   And
         41 if his head shed its hair before, he is forehead bald, yet he is
         42 clean.         But, if on the bald head, or bald forehead, there come a
               white or red spot, it is a leprosy in the bald head, or bald fore-
         43 head.         And if the priest, upon viewing, see that the appearance
               of the spot is white, or reddish, in the bald head, or bald forehead,
               like the appearance of the leprosy in the skin of the flesh, he is
         44 a leprous man, the priest shall instantly pronounce him un-

         45           Now the leper who hath the touch, must have his clothes
              rent, and his head uncovered, but he must cover his mouth, and
         46 he shall be proclaimed unclean.                         All the time the touch shall

         is not spread in the garment, or web, or vessel, whatever it be,
        made of skin ; the priest shall order that which hath the touch
     54 to be washed, and the priest shall set it apart seven days more.
     55 And if upon viewing the touch after it hath been washed, the
         priest see that the touch hath not changed its appearance,
        though it hath not spread, it is unclean, and must be burned
     56 with fire.   It is fixed in the garment, or web.    But if the priest
        see that the touch is of a brownish colour after beino: washed,
        he shall tear it out of the garment, or web, or out of the skin.
     57 And if it appear any more in the garment, or web, or in the
        leathern vessel, whatever it be, it is a fretting leprosy ; that in
     58 which the touch is, shall be burned with fire.         Now the gar-
        ment, or web, or any thing made of skin, which shall be wash-
        ed, and from which the touch shall depart, shall be washed a
     59 second time with water, and it shall be clean.       This is the law
        of the touch of a leprosy, in a woollen or hempen garment, or
        web, or any vessel made of skin, to pronounce it clean, or un-
         clean.
     XIV.      Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, This is the law
      2 of the leper.   Whenever he is cleansed he shall be brought be-
      3 fore the priest.    The priest shall go out of the camp; and if
        upon looking, the priest see that the touch of the leprosy is
      4 healed in the leper, the priest shall give orders, and they shall
        take from him who is cleansed, two clean live birds, and cedar

           orders, and they shall kill one live bird, over spring water, in
         6 an earthen vessel.   Then he shall take the living bird, and the
           cedar wood, and the scarlet yarn, and the hyssop, and dip them,
           and the living bird, in the blood of the bird which was killed over
        7 the spring water, and sprinkle some of it seven times on him who
           is cleansed from the leprosy, and he shall be clean. Then he shall
        8 let the live bird go into the field.   And he who is cleansed shall
           wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself with
           water ; and he shall be clean ; and after this he may come into the
           camp; but he must tarry abroad, out of his own house, seven days.
        6 And on the seventh day he shall shave off all the hair on his
           head, and beard, and his eye brows ; and having shaved off all
           his hair, he shall wash his clothes, and wash his body with water,
       10 and he shall be clean.     And on the eighth day he shall take
           two male lambs, of the first year, without blemish, and three
           tenths of fine flour, tempered with oil, for a sacrifice, and one
       11 cotulus of oil; and the priest who pronounceth him clean shall
           set the man who is cleansed, and these things, before the Lord, at
       12 the door of the tabernacle of the testimony ; and the priest shall
          take one of the male lambs, and offer it for a trespass offering,
          with the cotulus of cil, and set them apart as a dedication be-
       13 fore the Lord ; (Now they shall kill the lamb in the place where
          they kill the whole burnt offerings and the sin offeringsâ€”in a
          holy place) for as is the sin offering, so is the trespass offering,
       14 for the priest.    They are most holy.         And the priest shall
          take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest
          shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him who is cleansed,
          and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of
       15 his right foot.  Then takingsome of the cotulus of oil, the priest
       16 shall pour it into his own left hand, and he shall dip his right
          finger into the oil which is in his left hand, and sprinkle it with
       17 his finger before the Lord seven times.        And the rest of the
          oil which is in his left hand the priest shall put on the tip of
          the right ear of him who is cleansed, and on the thumb of his
          right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot on the place of
       18 the blood of the trespass offering.    And the oil still left in his
          hand the priest shall put on the head of him who is cleansed.
          So shall the priest make atonement for him before the Lord.
                                                                                                               ;

        19 Thenthe priest shall prepare the sin offering, and make atonement
             for him who is cleansed, with his sin offering, and after that the
        20 priest shall kill the whole burnt offering.                           And the priest shall
             offer up the whole burnt offering, and the sacrifice of flour, on
             the altar.        So shall the priest make atonement for him, and he
        21 shall be cleansed.               But if he be poor, and not of ability to fur-
             nish this, he shall take one lamb for the trespass which he hath
             committed, that it may be set apart as a dedication, so that atone-
             ment may be made for him, and a tenth of fine flour tempered
        22 with oil for a sacrifice, and a cotulus of oil, and two turtle doves,
             or two young pigeons, which ever he can find most readily, the
             one for a sin offering, and the other for a whole burnt offering.
        23 Arid on the eighth day he shall bring these to the priest, that
             he may cleanse him, to the door of the tabernacle of the testi-
        24 mony before the Lord.                    And the priest having taken the lamb
             of the trespass offering, and the cotulus of oil, shall set them
        25 apart as a dedication before the Lord.                            And he shall kill the
             lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of
             the blood of the trespass offering, and put it on the tip of the
             right ear of him who is cleansed, and on the thumb of his right

             of the oil into his own left hand, the priest shall sprinkle, with
       27 his right finger, some of the oil in his left hand, seven times be-
       28 fore the Lord.              And the priest shall put some of the oil in his
             hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is cleansed, and
             on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his

       29 and shall put the oil remaining in his hand, on the head of
             him who is cleansed ; so having made atonement for him
       oO before the Lord, the priest shall offer one of the turtle doves,
       31 or one of the young pigeons, as his hand hath found, the
             one for a sin offering, and the other for a whole burnt offer-

       33         Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, When

             for a possession, and I send a touch of a leprosy on the houses
                                                                                                                            ;;:

         35 of the laud which you possess, the owner of the house shall
               come and tell the priest, saying, Something like a touch hath
         3G appeared to me in the house.                             Upon this the priest shall order
               the house to be unfurnished, before he goeth in to view the
               touch, that what is in the house may not be made unclean.
               And this being done, the priest shall go in to examine the
          37 house.           And if, upon viewing the touch, he see that there is a
                touch in the walls of the house, and he seeth the cavities of a
               reddish or greenish colour, which appear to be deep in the wall
         38 upon coming out of the house, at the door of the house, the
         39 priest shall sequestrate the house for seven days.                                           And on the
               seventh day the priest shall come again and view the house
               And if he seeth that the touch hath spread in the walls of the
         40 house, the priest shall order them to take out the stones in which
               is the touch, and to carry them out of the city to an unclean place,
         41 and to scrape the house on the inside round about, and pour
               out the dust which is scraped off, without the city, into an un-
         42 clean place.               And they shall take other stones, well scraped, and
               put them in the place of those stones, and take other mortar, and
         43 plaister the house.                   And if the touch come again, and break out
               in the house after they have taken away the stones, and after
               the house hath been scraped, and after it hath been plaistered
         44 the priest shall go in and take a view ; and if the touch hath
               spread in the house, it is an inveterate leprosy in the house.                                            It
         45 is unclean.              They shall therefore demolish the house, and carry
               the wood thereof, and the stones thereof, and the rubbish thereof,
         46 out of the city to an unclean place.                                  Now he who goeth into
               the house, all the while it is sequestrated, shall be unclean till
         47 the evening.                And he who sleepeth in the house shall wash his
               clothes, and be unclean until the evening : And he who eateth
               in the house shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even-

               a view he seeth that the touch hath not spread in the house, after
               being plaistered, the priest shall pronounce the house clean,
         49 because the touch is healed.                          And in order to cleanse the house,
               he shall take two clean live birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet
               yarn, and hyssop.                And he shall kill one of the birds, over spring-
         Si water, in an earthen vessel.                         Then he shall take the cedar wood,
               and the scarlet yarn, and the hyssop, and the Jiving bird, and

         dip them in the blood of the bird which was killed over spring
     52 water, and with them sprinkle the house seven times, and
         cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the
         spring water, and with the living bird, and with the hyssop, and
     53 with the scarlet yam.     Then he shall send away the live bird
         out of the city into the open field.    So shall he make atone-
         ment for the house, and it shall be clean.
     54     This is the law for every touch of a leprosy and scald, and
         of the leprosy in a garment, and a house, and of a boil, and a
         scar, and the bright spot ; and to teach when a thing is un-

         of the leprosy.
     XV.      Again the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
      2 Speak to the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man
      3 hath an efflux from his body ; because of his efflux he is un-
         clean, and this is the law touching his uncleanness.
            If his efflux be a gonorrhea, this is an uncleanness in him.
         So long as his gonorrhea continueth, it is his uncleanness.
      4 Every bed on which such a one lieth is unclean ; and every
      5 seat whereon he shall sit, shall be unclean.    And whoever shall
         touch his bed must wash his clothes, and wash himself with wa-
      6 ter, and shall be unclean until the evening.      And whoever sit-
         teth on the seat whereon he sat, shall wash his clothes, and wash
      7 himself with water, and be unclean until the evening.          And
         whoever toucheth his flesh, shall wash his clothes, and wash
      8 himself with water, and be unclean until the evening.        And if
         he spit on one who is clean, the person who was clean shall
         wash his clothes, and wash himself with water, and be unclean
      9 until the evening.   And every saddle of an ass on which he shall
     10 ride, shall be unclean until evening.      And whoever toucheth
         any things which were under him, shall be unclean until even-
         ing. Andwhoever carrieth them shall wash his clothes, and wash
     11 himself with water, and be unclean until evening.        And every
         one whom he who hath the gonorrhea toucheth, without wash-
        ing his hands, shall wash his clothes, and wash himself witli
     12 water, and be unclean until evening.       And every earthen ves-
         sel which he shall touch shall be broken ; but a vessel of wood
     L5 shall be washed with water, and shall be clean.      And when he
         is clean of his disorder, he shall reckon for himself seven days

         for his purification, and he shall wash his clothes, and wash his
      14 body with water, and he shall be clean.       And on the eighth
         day he shall take him two turtle doves, or two young pigeons,
         and bring them before the Lord, to the door of the tabernacle
      15 of the testimony, and give them to the priest.     And the priest
         shall offer one of them for a sin offering, and the other for a
         whole burnt offering.    So shall the priest make atonement for
         him before the Lord, on the account of his efflux.
      16     And if any man's seed go from him by copulation, he shall
         wash his whole body with water, and be unclean until even-
      17 ing.   And every garment, and every skin on which the seminal
         matter may be, shall be washed with water, and be unclean
      18 until the evening.    And with respect to a woman, if any man
         lie carnally with her, they shall wash themselves with water,
      19 and be unclean until the evening.     And if any woman hath an
         efflux, and it be in her body, she shall confine herself seven
         days to her peculiar seat.    Every one who toucheth her shall
      20 be unclean until the evening.     And every thing on which she
         lieth during her state of separation, shall be unclean ; and every
      21 thing on which she shall sit, shall be unclean.      And whoever
         toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and wash himself with
      22 water, and be unclean until evening.      And whoever toucheth
         any thing on which she sat, shall wash his clothes, and wash
      23 himself with water, and be unclean until evening.         Whether
         she be in bed, or on any seat whereon she may sit, when one
      24 toucheth her, he shall be unclean until evening.    But if any one
         lie down by her, and her uncleanness is upon him, he shall be
         unclean seven days ; and every bed on which he may lie, shall
      25 be unclean.   And if any woman hath an efflux of blood many
         days, out of the time of her separation ; or if it continue be-
         yond the time of her separation, all the days of this issue of
      26 uncleanness, shall be like the days of her separation.   She shall
         be unclean ; and every bed on which she may lie during this
         issue, shall be to her like her bed of separation.     And every
         seat on which she may sit, shall be unclean according to the
      27 uncleanness of her separate state.   Every one who toucheth her
         shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and wash his body
      28 with water, and be unclean until evening.       And when she is
         clear of her disorder she shall reckon for herself seven days,

        29 and after that she shall be clean.                              And on the eighth day she
              shall take two turtle doves, or two young pigeons, and carry
              them to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the testi-
        30 mony.            And the priest shall offer one of them for a sin offering,
             and the other for a whole burnt offering ; and the priest shall
              make atonement for her before the Lord, on the account of her
       31 uncleanness.                Thus shall you make the children of Israel reli-
             giously careful to guard against their uncleannesses, that they
             may not die for their uncleannessâ€”for defiling my tabernacle
             which is among them.
       32          This is the law for him who hath a gonorrhea, and for him
             whose seed goeth from him so as to be defiled thereby ; and
       33 for her who is menstruous; and for the emission of seed be-

       XVI.             And the Lord spoke to Moses after the death of the two
             sons of Aaron : when they brought strange fire before the Lord,
         2 and were dead, the Lord said to Moses, Speak to Aaron thy
             brother, and let him not come at all times into the sanctuary,
             within the veil, into the presence of the propitiatory, which is
             on the ark of the testimony ; that he may not die.                                            For in a
             cloud I will appear on the propitiatory.                                In this manner Aaron
         3 shall come into that holy place.                             With a young bull from the
             herd for a sin offering [he shall bring] a ram for a whole burnt
         4 offering.           And he shall put on a holy linen vesture, and shall
             have linen drawers on his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen
             girdle, and shall put on a linen tiara.                            These are holy garments,
             therefore he shall wash his whole body with water, and put them
         5 on.        And he shall take, from the congregation of the children

         6 burnt offering.                And Aaron shall offer the young bull for his
             own sin offering, and make atonement for himself and his house-

             before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
         8 And Aaron shall cast lots on the goats, one lot, " For the
         9 Lord" and one lot, " For escajje."                                  And Aaron shall bring
             forward the goat, on which the lot, " For the Lord " fell                                             and
                                                                                                                 ;
       10 shall offer it for a sin offering, but the goat, on which the lot,

      Oh.
          " For escape," fell, he shall present alive before the Lord, to make
          atonement on it, so as to let it escape ;    and he shall send it
          away into the wilderness.
      11      Then Aaron shall bring forward the young bull for his
          own sin offering, to make atonement for himself and his house-
       12 hold, and shall slay the young bull for his sin offering ; and
          he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar, which
          is before the Lord, and he shall fill his hands with the com-
       13 pound incense, beaten fine, and carry it within the veil; and he
          shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord ; and the
          smoke of this incense shall cover the propitiatory which is on
       14 the testimonies, and he shall not die.    Then he shall take some
          of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger on the
          propitiatory, on the east side.    In front of the propitiatory he
          shall sprinkle some of the blood seven times with his finger.
       15 Then he shall kill the goat for a sin offeringâ€”that for the peo-
          ple, before the Lord, and he shall carry some of its blood with-
          in the veil, and do with the blood thereof as he did with the
          blood of the bull, and sprinkle the blood thereof on the pro-
       16 pitiatory, in front of the propitiatory, and make atonement for
          the holy place on account of the uncleanness of the children of
          Israel, and on account of their transgressions, for all their sins.
          While he shall be doing this in the tabernacle of the testimo-
          ny, which is built among them in the midst of their unclean-
       17 ness, there shall be no other man in the tabernacle of the testi-
          mony, from the time of his going in to make an atonement in
          the holy place, until he come out.       And when he shall have
          made atonement for himself, and his household, and for all the
       18 congregation of the children of Israel, he shall come out to the
          altar which is before the Lord, and make atonement on it.         He
          shall take some of the blood of the bull, and some of the blood
          of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar round about,
       19 and sprinkle some of the blood against it seven times with his
           finger, and purify it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the
       20 children of Israel.   And when he hath finished making atone-
          ment for the sanctuary, and for the tabernacle of the testimony,
          and the altar, and hath made purification for the priests, then
       21 he shall bring forward the living goat, and Aaron shall lay his
          hands on the head of the live goat, and over it make confession
      Oh. XVI.                     LEVITICUS.
         of all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and of all their
         transgressions, and all their sins, and lay them on the head of
         the live goat, and send him away by the hand of a man ready
     22 for the purpose, into the wilderness.        And the goat shall bear
     23 away upon him their iniquities to an untrodden land.                And
         having sent away the goat into the wilderness, Aaron shall go
         into the tabernacle of the testimony, and put off his linen rai-
         ment which he had on when he went into the holy place, and
     24 shall lay it up there.     And he shall wash his body with water,
         in a holy place, and put on his robe, and come forth, and offer
         his own whole burnt offering, and the whole burnt offering of
         the people, and made atonement for himself and his household,
     25 and for the people, as well as for the priests ; and shall offer up
     2(3 the suet of the sin offerings on the altar.      And he who letteth
         go the he-goat which was sent away to be set at liberty, shall
         wash his clothes, and wash his body with water, and after that
     27 come into the camp.         And they shall carry forth out of the
         camp the bull for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin of-
         fering, the blood of which was carried in to make atonement
         in the holy place, and shall burn them with fire, both the skins,
     28 and the flesh, and the dung thereof.       And he who burneth them
         shall wash his clothes and wash his body with water, and after
     29 that he shall come into the camp.        And this shall be to you an
         everlasting rite.   In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the
         month, you shall humble your souls, and do no work, whether
     30 native or the proselyte who dwelleth among you ; for on that day
         he shall make atonement for you, to purify you from all your
     31 sins before the Lord, that you may be cleansed.               This rest
         shall be to you a sabbath of sabbaths, and you shall humble
     32 your souls.    It is an everlasting statute.   That priest shall make
         the atonement, who shall be anointed, and whose hands shall
     33 be consecrated to officiate as priest after his father.        And he
         shall put on the linen raimentâ€”the holy raiment, and shall
         make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and for the taber-

         altar ; and he shall make atonement for the priests, and for all
         the congregation.    And the making this atonement for the chil-

           statute.    It shall be made once a year, as the Lord command-
           ed Moses.
       XVII.       Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to
           Aaron and his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and thou shalt
        2 say unto them, This is the thing which the Lord hath com-
        3 manded, saying, Be the man who he may of the children of
           Israel, or of the proselytes who dwell among you, who shall
           kill a young bull, or a sheep, or a goat, in the camp, or who
        4: shall kill any of them out of the camp, and not bring it to the
           door of the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be offered
           for a whole burnt offering, or for a thank offering to the Lord,
           to be accepted for a smell of fragranceâ€”even though he kill it
           without the camp, if he bring it not to the door of the taberna-
           cle of the testimony, that it may be offered as a gift to the
           Lord, before the tabernacle of the Lord, blood shall be imput-
           ed to that man.       He hath shed blood ; that person shall be cut
        5 off from among his people.           In order that the children of Israel
           may offer up their sacrifices, whatever they kill in the fields they
           shall carry for the Lord to the doors of the tabernacle of the
           testimony, to the priest, and offer them as a sacrifice of thanks-
        6 giving to the Lord ; and the priest shall pour the blood against
           the altar round about, before the Lord, at the doors of the ta-
           bernacle of the testimony ; and offer up the suet for a smell of
        7 fragrance for the Lord.          And they shall no more offer their sa-
           crifices to vanities after which they go a whoring.               It shall be a
        8 perpetual statute for you throughout your generations.                    There-
           fore thou shalt say unto them, Be the man who he may of the
           children of Israel, or of the children of the proselytes who
           dwell among you, who shall offer a whole burnt offering, or a
         9 sacrifice of flour, and not bring it to the door of the tabernacle
            of the testimony, that it may be offered to the Lord, that man
       10 shall be cut off from among his people.               And be the man who
            he may of the children of Israel, or of the proselytes who
            dwell among you, who shall eat any blood, I will set my face
            against that person who eateth blood, and destroy him from
       1    among his people.        For the blood is the life of all flesh ; and I
            have given it to you to make atonement on the altar for your
       12 souls.     For the blood shall make atonement for souls.                For this
            cause I have said to the children of Israel, No person among
            51
          Oh. XYIII.                                           LEVITICUS.
                 you shall eat blood, even the proselyte who dwelleth among you
           13 shall not eat blood.                        And be the man who he may of the chil-
                 dren of Israel, or of the proselytes who dwell among yon, who
                 in hunting shall catch a wild beast, or a bird, which may be
                 eaten, he shall pour out the blood, and cover it in the ground.
          14 For its blood is the life of all flesh, therefore I have said to the
                 children of Israel, you shall not eat the blood of any flesh.                                                         Be-
                 cause its blood is the life of all flesh, every one who eateth it
          1      shall be cut off.                  And every person who eateth that which hath
                 died of itself, or been caught by wild beasts, whether he be
                 one of yourselves, or of the proselytes, shall wash his clothes,
                 and wash himself with water, and be unclean until evening.
          1G Then he shall be clean.                              But if he do not wash his clothes, and
                if his body be not washed with water, he shall bear his iniquity.
          XVIII.                  Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the
            3 children of Israel ; and thou shalt say unto them, I the Lord
                 am your God; you shall not do according to the customs of
                 Egypt, in which you sojourned ; nor shall you do according
                 to the customs of the land of Chanaan, to which I am leading
            4 you ; you shall not walk by their ordinances.                                                     You shall exe-

            5 I the Lord am your Grod, therefore you shall keep all my com-

                 if a man do he shall live thereby.                                      I the Lord am your (rod

                 nakedness of thy father, that is the nakedness of thy mother,
                 thou shalt not uncover ; for she is thy mother, thou shalt not

          8 as if it had not been offered.                        It will not be accepted.                    He who
              eateth it will contract guilt, because he hath profaned the holy

              and not contract guilt on his account ; but let not thy hand take
        18 vengeance.               Thou shalt not bear a grudge against the children

                         3                         I am the Lord your God : you shallnot go after belly speak-

                         33                        I am the Lord your God ; if any stranger come among you
                         34 in your land, you shall not afflict him.                                                                                                                                              The stranger who

   Oh.
       shalt love him as thyself; for you were strangers in the land of

    35     I am the Lord your God ; you shall not do idjustice in the
       exercise of judgment, nor in measures, nor in weights, nor in
       balances.  You shall have among you just balances,just weights
       and a just measure.
    36     I am the Lord your God who brought you out [of the land
       of Egypt, therefore you shall keep all my law and all my sta-
       tutes and do them.   I am the Lord your God.
    XX.      Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Thou shalt
     2 also say to the children of Israel, If any of the children of Is-
       rael, or of those who have become proselytes among Israel,
        shall give any of his seed to an Archon let him be put to death.
     3 The people of the land shall stone him with stones : and as for
       me I will myself set my face against that man, and destroy
       him from among his people, because he hath given of his seed
       to an Archon, to pollute my holy things, and to profane the
     4 name of those who have been hallowed to me.         And though
       those born in the land may, upon seeing him, connive at that
     5 man when he giveth of his seed to an Archon, and not kill
       him, I will indeed set my face against that man, and against
       his family, and destroy him, and all who encourage him, to go
     6 a whoring after the Archons, from among their people.       And
        with respect to the person who shall follow belly speakers and
        sorcerers, so as to go a whoring after them, I will set my face
        against that person, and destroy him from among his people.
     7 You shall therefore be holy, because I the Lord your God am
     8 holy.   And you shall keep my statutes and do them.       It is I
     9 the Lord who hallow you.     Be the man who he may who cur-

        soever committeth adultery with the wife of a man who is head
        of a family, or who shall commit adulter}' with the wife of his
        neighbour, let both the adulterer and the adulteress be put to
    11 death.   And if any one lie with his father's wife he hath un-
        covered his father's nakedness, let them be put to death ; they
    12 are both guilty.   And if any man lie with his daughter in law,
        let them both be put to death ; for they have committed wick-
    13 edness, and are guilty.  And if any man lie with man as with

           a mother and a daughter it is a violation of law, they shall
           burn him and them with fire that there may be no transgres-
       15 sing of law among you.        And whoever shall lie with a beast,
       16 he shall be put to death, and you shall kill the beast.       And if
           any woman approach to any beast to be pressed under it, you
           shall kill the woman and the beast.     Let them be put to death.
       17 They are guilty.     Whoever shall take his sister by the same
           father, or the same mother, and see her nakedness, and she see
           his ; it is a disgraceful act. They shall be excommunicated in
           the presence of the children of their family.    He hath uncover-
       18 ed the nakedness of his sister.    They shall bear their sin.   And
           if any man lie with his wife during her infirmity, and uncover
           her nakedness, he hath uncovered her fountain, and she hath
           discovered her menstrual efflux ;    they shall both be cut off
       19 from their family.     Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
           thy father's sister or thy mother's sister ; for when one un-
       20 covereth his near of kin they shall bear their sin.         Whoever
           hath lain with his near of kin, he hath uncovered the naked-
       21 ness of his near relation, they shall die childless.  If a man take
           his brother's wife, it is an act of uncleanness.      He hath un-
           covered the nakedness of his brother ; they shall die childless.
       22 You shall keep all my statutes and my judgments and do them,
           that the land to which I am leading you to dwell therein, may
       23 not become your mortal enemy.          You must not walk in the
           customs of the nations which I drive out from before you.
       24 Because they did all these things, therefore I held them in ab-
           horrence, and said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I
           will give it to you for a possessionâ€”a land flowing with milk
       25 and honey.     I am the Lord your God, who have separated you
           from all the nations, you shall therefore keep yourselves sepa-
           rate by making a distinction between the clean beasts, and the
           beasts which are unclean; and between the clean birds, and
           the birds which are unclean ; and you shall not pollute your-
           selves with the beasts, or the birds, or any of the reptiles of the
           earth which I have distinguished for you, by uncleanness, and
       26 you shall be consecrated to me.      Because I the Lord your God
           am the Holy One, who hath separated you from all the na-

         tions, that you should be mine, therefore the man, or the wo-

         guilty.
     XXL         Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the
         priests, the sons of Aaron, and thou shalt say unto them, They
         must not defile themselves for the dead in their family, except
       2 only for their nearest of kin.      For a father, or a mother, or for
       3 sons, or daughters, or for a brother, and for a virgin sister who
         dwelleth with him, and who hath not been betrothed to a hus-
       4 band ; for these he may defile himself.       He must not defile him-
       5 self unexpectedly among his jDeople, to occasion their defile-
         ment.    You shall not shave the head to make it bald, for the
         dead.    Nor shall they shave their beard, nor make gashes in
       6 their flesh.   They shall be consecrated to their God, and shall
         not profane the name of their God, for they are to offer up the
         sacrifices of the Lordâ€”the gifts to their God ; therefore they
       7 shall be holy.     They shall not take to wife a harlot, nor a wo-
         man who hath been defiled, nor a woman divorced from her
         husband.     Because he is consecrated to the Lord his God,
       8 therefore thou shalt hallow him.       He offereth up the gifts of the
         Lord your God, he shall be hallowed.           Because I the Lord am
       9 the holy one who halloweth them, therefore if the daughter of
         a priest profane herself by whoredom, she profaneth the name
      10 of her father, she shall be burned with fire.         And with regard
         to the priest, who is great above his brethren, the oil of the
         anointed one having been poured on his head, and he having
         been consecrated to put on the garments, he must not take the
      11 tiara from his head, nor rend his garments, nor go near any
      12 dead person, nor defile himself for his father, nor for his mo-
         ther, nor go out of the holy places, nor defile the sanctuary of
         his God ; because the holy oil, the anointing of his God, is up-
      1   on him.    I am the Lord.     He shall take to wife a virgin of his
      14 own family.      A widow, or a woman divorced or defiled, or a
      15 harlot, these he shall not take.      He shall take none to wife, but
          a virgin of his own tribe ; and he shall not profane his seed
          among his people.      It is I the Lord who hallow him.
      1G      Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Say to Aaron,

           18 near to present the gifts of his God.                           No man who hath any
                blemish, who is blind, or lame, or hath a hare lip, or a slit ear
          19 nor any man who hath a contortion in the hand, or a splay foot,
          20 or who is hump backed, or dim sighted, or blear eyed, nor any
          21 man who hath the scurvy, or the itch, or a ruptureâ€”No per-
                son of the seed of Aaron the priest, who hath any blemish about
                him, shall come near to offer the sacrifices of thy God.                                       Be-

          22 of God.          With regard to the gifts of God, even the most holy,
          23 of these he may eat ; but he shall not approach to the veil, nor
               come near to the altar, because he hath a blemish.                               And he shall
               not profane the sanctuary of his God, because I am the Lord
          24 who halloweth them.
          XXII.             And when Moses had spoken to Aaron and his sons, and
            2 to all the children of Israel, then the Lord spoke to Moses, say-
               ing, Speak to Aaron and his sons and let them take heed not
               to profane my holy name, in respect to any of the holy things
               of the children of Israel, which they dedicate to me.                                  I am the
           3 Lord ; say unto them, What man soever of your seed, through-
               out your generations, shall come near to the holy things which
               the children of Israel may dedicate to the Lord, and have any
               uncleanness upon him, that person shall be cut off from me.
           4 I am the Lord your God ; though a man be of the seed of Aaron
               the priest, yet if he be a leper, or hath a gonorrhea, he shall
               not eat of the holy things until he be cleansed.                               And with re-
               spect to him who toucheth any uncleanness of the dead, or the
               man from whom seminal matter may proceed ; or who may
            5 touch any unclean reptile which may defile him ; or any man,
               by whom he may be defiled, whatever his uncleanness may be
            6 the person who shall touch such things shall be unclean until
               evening.         He shall not eat of the holy things unless he wash
            7 his body with water, and the sun be set.                               When he shall be
               clean, then he may eat of the holy things ; for it is his food.
            8 What died of itself, or is torn by wild beasts, he shall not eat
            9 to pollute himself therewith.                      I am the Lord, therefore they
               shall keep my statutes, that they may not, on the account of
          10 those things, contract guilt, and die because of them, when
               they profane them.
          XXII.                   LEVITICUS.
      Ok.
             I am the Lord, the God who halloweth them, therefore
         none of another family shall eat the holy things, nor shall he, who
         sojourneth with a priest, or who is hired by him, eat of them.
      11 But if the priest shall have a person bought with money, this
         person may eat of his food.     And they who are born in his fa-
      12 mily may eat of his food.     But if the daughter of a priest be
         married to a man of another family, she shall not eat of the
      13 dedications of the sanctuary.    But if the daughter of a priest
         become a widow, or be divorced, and have no issue, she may
         return to her father's house as in her youth, and eat of her fa-
      14 ther's food : But none of another family shall eat thereof.    And
         whoever shall eat of the holy things through inadvertence, he
         shall add a fifth to it, and give the holy thing to the priest.
      15 Thus the priests will not profane the holy things of the chil-
      16 dren of Israel, which they set apart for the Lord, nor bring
         upon themselves the guilt of a trespass, when they eat their
         holy things, for I am the Lord who hallow them.
      17     Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to Aaron
         and his sons, and to the whole congregation of Israel, and thou
      18 shalt say unto them, Be the man who he may of the children
         of Israel, or of the proselytes who dwell among them in Israel,
         who shall bring his gifts according to any vow they may have
         made, or according to any determination they may have come
      19 to, whatever they bring for a whole burnt offering to God,
         must, in order to be accepted for you, be males without blem-
      20 ish, from the herd, or from the sheep, or from the goats.     What
         hath any blemish in it they shall not bring to the Lord ; for it
      21 will not be accepted for you.    And whoever shall bring a sacri-
         fice of thanksgiving to the Lord, either in discharge of a vow,
         or as a free will offering, or at your festivals, from the herd
         or from the flock, it must, in order to its being accepted, be
      22 without blemish.    There must be no blemish in it.     That which
         is blind, or bruised, or which hath its tongue cut, or hath been
         eaten by ants, or is infected with scurvy or mangeâ€”these they
         shall not bring to the Lord, nor shall you give any such for an
      23 offering of homage on the altar to the Lord.      A young bull, or
         a sheep which hath its ear cropped, or its tail cut, these thou
         mayst slaughter for thyself; but in discharge of thy vow they
     24 will not be accepted.     What are castrated by crushing, bruis-
      Ch. XXIII.                   LEVITICUS.
          ing, cutting or extractingâ€”these thou shalt not bring to the
      25 Lord, nor shall you make an offering of them in your land, nor
          from the hand of a stranger bring any such forward as gifts for
          your God.     Because there is a defect in themâ€”a blemish in
          them; they will not be accepted for you.
      26      Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, With respect
      27 to a young bull, or a sheep, or a goat, when it is brought forth,
          it must be seven days under its dam, and on the eighth day,
          and thenceforward, it will be accepted as a gift for an homage
      28 offering to the Lord.    But whether it be a young bull, or a lamb,
          thou must not kill the dam and the young on the same day.
      29 And if thou wilt offer a sacrificeâ€”a vow of joy, to the Lord,
          in order that you may offer it acceptably, it must be eaten on
      30 the same day.     You shall not leave any of the flesh of it till the
      31 next morning.      I am the Lord, therefore you shall keep these
      32 my commands, and do them ; And you shall not profane the
          name of the Holy One ; so shall I be hallowed in the midst of
      33 the children of Israel.     I am the Lord, who am hallowing you,
          who am bringing you out of the land of Egypt, to be your
          God.    I am the Lord.
      XXIII.        Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the
        2 children of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, With respect
          to the festivals of the Lord, which you shall proclaim holy, set
        3 days,â€”these are my festivals.        Six days thou shalt perform
          works, but on the seventh day are sabbaths, a solemn rest de-
          dicated to the Lord, thou shalt not do any work.         Sabbaths are
        4 for the Lord in all your dwellings.      These are the festivals for
          the Lordâ€”holy, set days, which you shall proclaim in their set
        5 times.   In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month,
        6 between the two evenings, is the passover for the Lord.           And
           on the fifteenth day of this month beginneth the festival of un-
        7 leavened bread for the Lord.         Seven days you shall eat un-
           leavened bread.    Now the first day shall be a holy, set day for
        8 you.    You shall do no sacrificial service, but offer whole burnt
           offerings to the Lord seven days, and the seventh day shall be
           a holy set day for you.    You shall do no sacrificial service.
        9      Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the
       10 children of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, When you are
           come into the land which I give you, and are about to reap the
                                LEVITICUS.
     Ch. XXIII.
        harvest thereof, you shall bring a sheaf, as the first fruits of
     11 your harvest, to the priest, and he shall offer up the sheaf be-
        fore the Lord, to be accepted for youâ€”On the morrow after
     12 the first day, the priest shall offer this up. And on the day when
        you bring the sheaf, you shall prepare a lamb without blemish^
        of the first year, for a whole burnt offering for the Lord, and
     13 for the sacrifice thereof, two tenths of fine flour, made up with
        oil for the Lord, a smell of fragrance for the Lordâ€”and for
     14 the libation thereof, the fourth of an hin of wine.    You shall
        not eat bread, nor parched grains, of the new corn, till this
        dayâ€”until you have offered these gifts to your God.      It is an
        everlasting statute for your generations, in all your dwellings,
     15 That from the morrow of these sabbathsâ€”from the day on
        which you offer up the dedicated sheaf, you shall reckon for
        yourselves seven whole weeks, even till the morrow after the
     16 last week, you shall reckon fifty days, and then offer a sacri-
     17 flee of new corn to the Lord.  You shall bring from your dwell-
        ing two loaves, as loaves of dedication.   They shall consist of
        two tenths of fine flour. Being of the first fruits for the Lord,
     18 they shall be baked with leaven.   And with the loaves you shall
        present seven lambs of the first year, without blemish, and one
        young bull from the herd, and two rams without blemish ; and
        they shall be a whole burnt offering for the Lord ; and their
        sacrifices, and their libations, shall be a sacrifice, a smell of fra-
     19 grance for the Lord.    They shall also prepare one kid of the
        goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year, for a
     20 sacrifice of thanksgiving, with the loaves of the first fruits.
        And the priest shall dedicate these, with the loaves of the first
        fruits, as a dedication before the Lord, with the two lambs.
        They shall be dedicated to the Lord ; they shall be for the priest
     21 who offereth them.   And you shall call this day, a set day.   It
        shall be hallowed for you.  On it you shall do no sacrificial work.
        It is an everlasting statute for your generations in all your dwell-
     22 ings.  And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall
        not make a clean riddance of the harvest of thy field when thou
        reapest, nor shalt thou gather up the gleanings of thy harvest.
        Thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the stranger.   I am
        the Lord your God.
     23     Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the
                                                                                                                   ;

          Ch.
         24 children of Israel, and say, In the seventh month, on the first
               day of the month, there shall be a rest for yonâ€”a memorial of
          25 trumpets.            It shall be a holy set day for you.                     You shall not do
               any sacrificial service, but offer a whole burnt offering to the
          26 Lord.         Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, On the
          27 tenth day of the seventh month is the day of Atonement.                                             It
               shall be a holy set day for you ; and you shall humble your
          28 souls, and offer a whole burnt offering to the Lord.                                      On this
               day you shall not do any kind of work : for it is the day of
               Atonement for you, to make atonement for you before the
          29 Lord your God.                 Every soul who shall not humble himself on
          30 that day, shall be cut off from among his people.                                     And every
               person who shall do any work on that day, shall be destroyed
          31 from among the people.                       You shall not do any kind of work.
               It is an everlasting statute for your generations in all your
          32 dwellings.            They shall be sabbaths of sabbaths for you, that
               you may humble your souls.                         From the ninth of the month,
              'from evening till evening, you shall keep these sabbaths of
               yours.
          33         Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the
          34 children of Israel, and say, On the fifteenth of this seventh
               month shall commence the festival of Tabernacles, seven days
          35 for the Lord.             The first day shall be proclaimed holy. You shall
          36 do no sacrificial work ; seven days you shall offer whole burnt
                offerings to the Lord, and the eighth day shall be proclaimed
                holy for you, and you shall offer whole burnt offerings to the
                Lord.       It is the exit.         You shall not do any sacrificial service.
          37         These are the festivals for the Lord, which you shall pro-
                claim holy, in order that you may offer homage offerings to the
                Lordâ€”whole burnt offerings, with their sacrifices and their li-
                bationsâ€”that allotted for each day on its day, over and above
          38 the sabbaths of the Lord, and over and above your gifts, even
                besides all your vows, and besides your free will offerings,
          39 which you may give to the Lord.                           Now on the fifteenth day of
                this seventh month, when you have finished the ingathering
                of the products of the land, you shall begin this festival of se-
          40 ven days for the Lord.                    On the first day there shall be a rest
                and on the eighth day, a rest.                    And on the first day you shall
                take the ripe fruit of trees, and branches of palm trees, and
         XXIV.                 LEVITICUS.
    Oh.
        bushy boughs of trees and willows, and branches of the willow
        of the brook, to rejoice before the Lord your God seven days
    41 of the year.   It shall be an everlasting statute for your genera-
        tions. In the seventh month you shall celebrate this festival.
    42 You shall dwell in booths seven days.     All that are Israelites
        born, shall dwell in booths, that your posterity may see that I
    43 caused the children of Israel to dwell in tents when I brought
        them out of the land of Egypt.   I am the Lord your God.
    44     And when Moses had mentioned these festivals of the Lord
    XXIV. to the Israelites, the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Give
     2 orders to the children of Israel, and let them bring the oil,
     3 pure expressed oil for light, that a lamp may burn continual-
        ly, without the veil, in the tabernacle of the testimony.  And
        Aaron and his sons shall keep it burning, from evening till
        morning, continually, before the Lord.    It is an everlasting
     4 statute for your generations.  You shall keep the lamps burning
        on the pure candlestick before the Lord, until the morning.
     5 And you shall take fine flour, and make it into twelve loaves,
     6 every loaf shall consist of two tenths ; and you shall lay them
        in two piles, six loaves in each pile, on the pure table before
     7 the Lord.   And on each pile you shall lay pure frankincense,
        and salt.  They shall be set before the Lord for loaves of re-
     8 membrance.     On the day of the sabbaths they shall be set con-
        tinually before the Lord, in the sight of the children of Israel,
        as an everlasting covenant ; and they shall be for Aaron and his
     9 sons.   And they shall eat them in a holy place ; for they are
        most holy.  This shall be their peculiar due, for ever, from those
        things sacrificed to the Lord.
    10     Xow there had come out among the Israelites a son of an
        Israelitish woman, but his father was an Egyptian.    And this
        son of the Israelitish woman, and a man who was an Israelite,
    11 quarrelled in the camp.    And the son of the Israelitish woman
        having named the name, cursed it.     Upon which they brought
        him before Moses.   Now his mother's name was Salomith, she
    12 was a daughter of Dabri, of the tribe of Dan.    And when they
        had committed him to custody, to pass sentence on him by the
     13 decree of the Lord, the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Lead
     14 out him who cursed, without the camp, and all who heard
        shall lay their hands on his head, and all the congregation shall
                                                                  â€”;
      Ch. XXV.                 LEVITICUS.
      15 stone him.  Then speak to the children of Israel, and thon shalt
      16 say to them, Be the man who he may who shall curse a god,
         he shall contract guilt ; but let him who nameth the name of
         Lord be put to death.Let the whole congregation of Israel stone
         him with stones ; whether he be a proselyte, or born among
      17 them, when he nameth the name of the Lord, let him die.And
         whosoever smiteth another so that he die, let him be put to
      18 death.  And whosoever shall smite a beast, so that it die, let
      19 him make compensation, beast for beast.      And whosoever
         shall cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done to
      20 him, so shall it be done to himself; bruise for bruise ; eye for
         eye ; tooth for tooth ; according to the blemish he hath given
      21 the man, so shall it be returned to him.Whosoever shall smite
      22 a man so that he die, let him be put to death, shall be one and
      23 the same decision for the proselyte, and for the neighbour
         for I am the Lord your God.   Thereupon Moses spoke to the
         children of Israel, and they brought forth him who had cursed,
         without the camp, and stoned him with stones.
            And when the children of Israel had done as the Lord
      XXV.     commanded Moses, The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
         Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them,
       2 When you are come into the land which I give you, the land
       3 which I give you must rest sabbaths for the Lord.  Six years
         thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy
       4 vineyard, and gather the fruit thereof.But in the seventh year
         there shall be sabbathsâ€”there shall be a rest for the land
         sabbaths for the Lord.  Thou shalt neither sow thy field nor
       5 prune thy vineyard, nor reap the spontaneous productions
         of thy field, nor gather the grapes of thy dedication.It shall
       6 be a year of rest for the land.And the sabbaths of the land
         shall be food for thee, and for thy man servant, and for thy
         maid servant, and for thy hired servant, and for the stranger
       7 who sojourneth with thee; and for thy cattle, and the wild
         beasts in thy land, shall the whole product thereof be for food.
       8 Moreover thou shalt reckon for thyself seven rests of years,
         seven times seven years, and these forty nine years, shall be
       9 the seven weeks of years ; and you shall make proclamation
         with the sound of a trumpet, throughout all your land, in the
         seventh month, and tenth day of the monthâ€”On the day of
     Ch. XXV.                   LEVITICUS.
        the atonement, yon shall make proclamation with a trumpet,
     10 throughout all your land, and dedicate the fiftieth year, and pro-
        claim liberty in the land, to all the inhabitants thereof.  And
        this shall be a year of rest, a Jubilee for you ; and every one
        shall return to his possession, and every one shall go to his
     11 family.  This jubilee, this fiftieth year, shall be for you a ge-
        neral release, you shall not sow, nor shall you reap the spon-
        taneous productions thereof, nor gather the vintage which is
     12 dedicated.  Because it is a jubilee, it shall be holy to you.
     13 From the fields you may eat the productions thereof.     In this
        year of release, proclaimed by the sound of trumpets, every
     14 one shall return to his possession.     Whether therefore thou
        sellest to thy neighbour, or purchasest of thy neighbour, let
     15 no man take advantage of his neighbour.       According to the
        number of years after the jubilee, thou shalt purchase of thy
        neighbour ; and according to the number of years of crops, he
     16 shall sell to thee.In proportion to the greater number of years,
        thou shalt rate his possession higher, and according to the few-
     17 ness of the years, thou shalt rate it lower.   For according to
         the number of crops, so shall he sell to thee. Let no man take
        advantage of his neighbour.     Thou shalt fear the Lord thy
     18 God.   I am the Lord your G-od, therefore you shall practise
        all my rules of rectitude, and all my judgments, and keep
        and do them ; so shall you dwell securely in the land, and the
     19 land shall yield its productions ; and you shall eat plentifully,
     20 and dwell securely therein.  Now if you should say, What shall
        we eat in this seventh year, if we neither sow nor gather our
     21 produce?    I indeed will send my blessing for you, in the sixth
        year, and it will make the products thereof sufficient for the
     22 three years.   Though you are to sow in the eighth year, yet
        on account of the produce, you shall eat the old, even to the
        ninth year, even till the products of that come in, you shall
     23 eat of the old store.  Now the land must not be sold forever ;
     24 for the land is mine.   Because you are strangers, and sojourn-
        ers before me, therefore in all the land of your possession,
     25 you shall grant a right of redeeming the land.   x\nd if thy bro-
        ther who is with thee become poor, and sell any part of his
         possession ; when he who is next of kin to him cometh, he shall
     26 redeem what his brother hath sold.   Andifany person hath none

              to redeem, and his own hand hath attained, and found a suffici-
        27 ency, he shall have the right of redemption.                               And he shall com-
              pute the years of his sale, and pay back what is still due to the
              man to whom he sold it.                    So shall he return to his possession.
         28 But if his hand cannot attain a sufficiency to repay him, the
              sale shall be good to him who purchased, until the last sixth
              year of the jubilee, and in the jubilee, he shall quit, and the
         29 seller shall return to his possession.                        And if any person sell a
              dwelling house in a walled city, he shall have the right of re-
         30 deeming it till the term expire.                            The term for redemption
              shall be a year.            And if it be not redeemed till the whole year
              expire, the house which is in a walled city, shall be confirmed
              for ever to the purchaser.                   And he shall not go out in the ju-
         31 bilee.         But the houses which are in villages, unsurrounded
              with walls, shall be accounted as the fields in the country,
              and shall be always subject to redemption, and go out in the
         32 jubilee.         And the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities
              of their possession, shall always be redeemable by the Levites
              and whoever among the Levites shall redeem, the intermedi-
              ate purchase of the houses of the city of their possession shall
         33 terminate in the jubilee.                    For the houses of the cities of the
              Levites are           their possession            among the children of Israel.
         34 And the fields set apart for their cities shall not be sold; for
         35 this is their perpetual possession.                         And if thy brother who is
              with thee become poor and distressed in his circumstances
              when near thee, thou shalt help him, as a proselyte or a so-
         36 journer, and thy brother shall live with thee.                                Thou shalt not
              take from him usury or increase, but thou shalt fear thy God,
         37 I the Lord ; and thy brother shall live with thee.                                    Thou shalt
              not lend him thy money on usury, nor give him thy victuals
         38 for an increase.               I am the Lord your God who brought you
              out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Chanaan, and
         39 to be your God.                And if thy brother who dwelleth by thee be
              humbled, and sold to thee, he shall not serve thee as a slave.
         40 He shall be with thee as a hireling, or a sojourner.                                   Until the
         41 year of the release he shall work for thee, and in the year of
              the release he shall go out, and his children with him, and
              shall go to his own familyâ€”to his paternal possession he shall
         42 haste away.             Because they are my servants, whom I brought
      Ck. XXYI.                    LEVITICUS.
      43 out of the land of Egypt ; he must not be sold as a slave.      Thou
         shall not over burthen him with toil, but fear the Lord thy
      44 God.    The male and female slaves, whom thou mayst have,
         must be of the nations around thee.        Of them you may pur-
      45 chase a male or a female slave ; or of the children of strangers
         who sojourn among youâ€”of them you may purchase and of
      46 their relations who may be born in your land.          Let them be
         your property, and divide them among your children after you,
         and they shall be your slaves for life : but of your brethren, the
         children of Israel, one shall not rule over another with ri-
      47 gour.   And if a proselyte, or a sojourner who is with thee,
         prosper, and thy brother, being poor, be sold to the proselyte,
         or to the stranger who is with thee, or to the descendant of
      48 the proselyte ; after he is sold he shall have a right to be re-
      49 deemed.     One of his brethren may redeem .him, his uncle, or
          his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any of his blood relations,
          of the same tribe, may redeem him ; and if he be able he may
      50 redeem himself.      In which case he shall settle with him who
          purchased him, from the year he sold himself, to the year of
          the release, and the price of his purchase shall be as the yearly
          wages of a hired servant for the years he is to be with him.
      51 And if any one hath many years to serve, for them he shall pay
          the rates of redemption, on account of the money paid for him ;
      ~sl and if but few years remain to the year of release, he shall set-
          tle with him according to those years, and pay the rates of his
      53 redemption.     As a servant hired from year to year, he shall be
          with him ; and thou shalt not suffer him to be oppressed with
      54 labour in thy sight.    If he be not redeemed in any of these ways,
          in the year of the release he shall go out, and his children with
          him ; for the children of Israel are my domesticsâ€”they are
          my servants whom I brought out of Egypt.
      XXVI.        I am the Lord your God ; you shall not make for your-
          selves carved or graven images, nor set up a pillar for your-
        2 selves, nor place a watch stone in your land to worship it.     I am
          the Lord your God, you shall keep my sabbaths, and rever-
        3 ence my holy things.      I am the Lord ; if you walk in my sta-
        4 tutes, and keep my commandments, and do them, I will give
          you rain in its season : and the land shall yield its productions ;
        5 and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit ; and the thresher
       7                                                                         I

          shall overtake the vintager ; and the vintager shall overtake the
          sower ; and you shall eat your bread in plenty ; and dwell in
          your land securely, and war shall not pass through your land.
        6 I will indeed give you peace in your land ; and you shall lie
        7 down to rest ; and there shall be none to make you afraid.         I will
          destroy the wild beasts out of your land ; and you shall pursue
          your enemies, and they shall fall before you with destruction.
       8 Even five of you shall pursue an hundred ; and a hundred of
          you shall pursue myriads, and your enemies shall fall before
       9 you by the sword.        And I will watch over you, and increase
          you, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
      10 And you shall eat the last year's crops, and the crops of the year
      11 before, and remove old stores out of the way of new.               And I
          will fix my tabernacle among you, and my soul will not abhor
      12 you.    And I will walk about among you, and be your God,
          and you shall be my people.
      13      I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land
          of Egypt.    When you were slaves, I broke the bond of your
      14 yoke, and led you out in confidence : Now if you will not heark-
      15 en to me, nor perform these my commandments, but disobey
          them, and your souls abhor my judgments, so as not to per-
          form all my commandments, so as to break my covenant, I will
      10 deal with you in this mannerâ€”I will send against you distress,
          and the scab, and the gangrene to eat out your eyes ; and wast-
          ing consumption ; and you shall sow your seed in vain ; for your
      1   enemies shall eat it : and I will set my face against you ; and
          you shall fall before your enemies ; and they who hate you shall
          pursue you; and you shall flee when there is none pursuing
      18 you.    And if for all this you will not hearken to me, I will pro-
          ceed to chastise you seven fold for your offences, and break
      19 the haughtiness of your pride.â€”I will make the heaven for
          you as iron, and your land as brass ; and your strength shall be
      20 spent in vain.     The earth shall not yield you its seed, nor shall
      21 the trees of the field yield you their fruit.       And after all these
          things, if you walk adversely and will not hearken to me, I will
      22 bring seven fold plagues upon you according to your sinsâ€”
          will send against you the wild beasts of the earth, and they shall
          devour you, and destroy your cattle ; and I will make you few
      23 in number, and your high ways shall be desolate.              And if by

    Oh.
        these thmo-s you be not reformed, but walk adversely before
    2-1 me, I also will walk with you in adverse wrath, and smite you
    25 seven fold for your sinsâ€”I will bring a sword against you to
        avenge the cause of the covenant ; and when you flee to your
        cities, I will send pestilence among you, and you shall be de-
    20 livered into the hands of your enemies.        In your affliction for
        want of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven
        and dole out your bread by weight, and you shall eat, but shall
    27 not be satisfied.   And if for these things you will not hearken
    28 to me, but walk adversely before me, I also will walk with you
        in adverse ire, and chastise you seven fold, according to your
    29 sins.   And you shall eat the flesh of your sons ; and the flesh of
    30 your daughters also you shall eat : and I will lay waste your
        pillars, and utterly destroy your carved images of wood, and
        cast your mangled limbs among the mangled limbs of your
    31 idols, and my soul will abhor you.        And I will lay waste your
        cities, and make your sanctuaries a desolation, and no longer be
    o2 reo-aled with the smell of your sacrifices.    I will also make your
        land a desolation, and your enemies who dwell therein shall be
    33 astonished at it.   And I will scatter you among the nations, and
    34 a sword shall overtake and consume you.         And your land shall
        be a waste, and your cities a desolation.       And the land shall
        then enjoy its sabbaths all the time of its desolation.        When
        you shall be in the land of your enemies, the land shall then
    35 rest ; and the land shall keep those sabbaths, which it did not
    3b' keep by your sabbaths when you dwelt therein.             And upon
        those of you who are left, I will bring a slavery, which shall
        reach their very hearts, in the land of their enemies.     The sound
        of a leaf driven by the wind will scare them ; and they shall flee
        like those who flee from a battle, and shall fall when none pur-
    37 sueth.    And brother shall overlook brother as in a battle, though
        none attacketh ; and you shall not be able to withstand your
    38 enemies.    And you shall perish among the nations, and the land
    39 of your enemies shall devour you.         And those of you who are
        left shall pine away for their sins, and for the sins of their fa-
    40 thersâ€”In the land of their enemies they shall pine away, and
        confess their sins and the sins of their fathers, that they have
    41 transgressed, and neglected me, and that they have walked per-
        versely before me, and I have walked with them in vengeful

           ire.  When I am destroying them in the land of their enemies,
           then will their imcircumcised heart be ashamed, and then will
       42 they bear their sins with humble submission ; whereupon I
           will call to remembrance the covenant with Jacob, and the co-
           venant with Isaak, and I will call to remembrance the cove-
       43 nant with Abraham, and remember the land.            When the land
           shall be forsaken by them, and when the land shall have enjoy-
           ed its sabbaths by being made a waste on their account, and
           they have borne their iniquities because they neglected my
       44 judgments, and in their hearts abhorred my statutes, (as I did
           not, when they were in their enemies' country, wholly over-
           look them, nor abhor them so as to destroy them utterly, for
       45 breaking my covenant which I made with them, for I am the
           Lord their C4od) then will I remember the covenant with them
            â€”that old covenant when I brought them out of the land of
       46 Egyptâ€”out of the house of bondage, to be their G-od.             I am
           the Lord ; These are my judgments, and these are my statutes,
           and this is the law which the Lord hath given between him-
           self and the children of Israel, at mount Sina, by the ministra-
           tion of Moses.
        XXVII.        Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to
         2 the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whoever
           shalt vow a vow as the price of his life to the Lord, the price
         3 shall beâ€”of a male from twenty to sixty years of age, the
         4 price shall be fifty didrachms of silver, sanctuary weight ; and
         5 of a female, the valuation shall be thirty didrachms.       And if it
            be of one from five to twenty years of age, the price of a male
         6 shall be twenty didrachms, and of a female ten didrachms.        And
            if it be of one from a month to five years old, the price of a male
            shall be five didrachms, and of a female three didrachms of silver.
         7 And if it be of one from sixty years old and upwards ; if a male
            the price shall be fifteen didrachms of silver, and if a female, ten
         8 didrachms.     And if any be too poor for this valuation, he shall
            present himself before the priest and the priest shall set a value
            on himâ€”according to the ability of him who made the vow, the
         9 priest shall value him.    But if the gift to the Lord be from the
            cattle which may be offered, whoever shall give any of these to
        10 the Lord, it shall be sacred.    He shall not change it, a good for a
            bad ; nor a bad for a good : and if he actually change this beast
                                                                                                                       ;

      Ch.
            for another, both it and that given in exchange shall be sacred.
      11 But if it be any kind of unclean beast of which a gift cannot be
            made to the Lord, he shall present the beast before the priest
      12 and the priest shall value it at a medium between a good and
            a bad one ; and according as the priest shall value it, so it shall
      13 stand ; and if the person chuse to redeem it, he shall add a
      14 fifth to the valuation.                    And if a man make a dedication of his
            house to the Lord, the priest shall value it at a medium be-
            tween a good and a bad house.                              And according as the priest
      15 shall value it so it shall stand; and if he who dedicated it
            chuse to redeem it, he shall add thereto a fifth of the money at
      10 which it was rated, and it shall be his.                               And ifit be apart of the
            land of his possession, which a man shall dedicate to the Lord,
            the valuation shall be according to the seed thereof, fifty di-
       17 drachms of silver for a core of barleyâ€”If he dedicate it at the
      18 jubilee ; at this valuation it shall stand.                               But if he dedicate his
            field after the jubilee ; the priest shall compute for him the

      19 deduction from the full valuation of it.                                    And if the man who
            made the dedication chuse to redeem the field, he shall add
            one fifth of the money to the valuation of it, and it shall be his.
      20 But if he decline to redeem the field, and selleth the field to
      21 another man, he shall never afterwards redeem it ; but at the
            going out of the jubilee the field shall be consecrated to the
            Lord, and he shall have possession of it as land set apart
      22 for the priest.               And if a man make a dedication to the Lord of
            a field which he hath purchased, and which is not a part of
      23 his inheritance, though the priest settle with him the amount
            of the price from the year of the jubilee, and he pay the price
            at which it was rated on the day he made the dedication to the
      24 Lord ; yet in the year of the jubilee the field shall be restored
            to the man of whom he purchased it, and whose field of posses-
      25 sion it was.              Nowevery valuation shall be by holy weight, twenty
      26 oboli making a didrachm.                           And with regard to every firstling
            if it be among the cattle, it shall be for the Lord, and none
            shall dedicate it.               Whether it be of the herds or flocks it is the
       27 Lord's.           And if it be of the four footed beasts which are un-
            clean, he must redeem it according to the valuation, and add
             thereto a fifth, and it shall be his.                         And if he will not redeem
             it, it shall be sold for its value.

           anathema from among men, shall not be redeemable, but by
       30 death.    The whole tenth of the land, both of the produce of the
           land, and of the fruit of the trees, is for the Lord.       It is dedi-
       31 cated to the Lord.      And if any man chuse to redeem his tenth
           by purchase, he shall add to the valuation a fifth, and it shall be
       32 his.   Now the whole tenth of herds and flocksâ€”even every
           one which in numbering shall come under the rod, that tenth
       33 shall be dedicated to the Lord.       Thou shalt not change a good
           for a bad, nor a bad for a good ; and if thou shalt actually make
           an exchange, that given in exchange shall also be consecrated,
           and shall not be redeemed.

      54     And when the Israelites had done according to all that the

   III.         Now this is the genealogy of Aaron and Moses.
     2    On the day when the Lord spoke to Moses at mount Si-
      na, these were the names of xVaron's sons, Nadab his first
     3 born, and Abiud, Eleazar and Ithamar. These were the names
       of Aaron's sons who were anointed priests, whose hands were
     4 consecrated to minister in the priest's office.But Nadab and
       Abiud died in the presence of the Lord, upon their offering
       strange fire before the Lord, in the wilderness of Sina, and they
       had no children ; so Eleazar and Ithamar officiated as priests
     5 with their father.And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Take
                                                                           â€”;

        6 the tribe of Levi, and thou shalt present them before Aaron
        7 the priest, and they shall minister to him, and keep his watch-
           es, and the watches of the children of Israel before the taber-
        8 nacle of the testimony, to do the works of the tabernacle.     Now
           that they may keep all the utensils of the tabernacle of the tes-
           timony, and the watches of the children of Israel, as far as they
        9 respect all the works of the tabernacle ; and that thou mayst
           give the Levites, to Aaron and his sons the priests ; they are
           to be given to me as a gift from among the children of Israel.
       10 And thou shalt set Aaron and his sons over the tabernacle of
           the testimony, and they shall keep watch over their priesthood,
           and all that appertain to the altar, and that are within the veil
           and if any one of another family touch these, he shall be put
           to death.
       11     Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Behold I have
       12 taken the Levites from among the children of Israel, instead of
           all the first born males among the children of Israel.    The Le-
           vites shall be the price of their redemption, and shall be mine ;
       13 for every first born belongeth to me.    On the day when I smote
           every first born in the land of Egypt, I hallowed for myself
           all the firstlings in Israel.The firstlings both of man and beast
           shall belong to me.   I am the Lord.
       14     Then the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sina,
       15 saying, Review the children of Levi, according to the houses
           of their families, according to their communities.         Review
       16 them every male, from a month old and upwards.         Accordingly
           Moses and Aaron reviewed them, at the command of the Lord,
       17 in the manner the Lord commanded them.            Now these were
           the sons of Levi by their names, Gerson, Kaath, and Merari.
       18 And these are the sons of Gerson, according to their comniu-
       19 nities ; Lobeni and Semei.     And these are the sons of Kaath
           according to their communities, Amram and Issaar, Chebron
       20 and Oziel.    And the sons of Merari, according to their com-
           munities, were Mooli and Mousi.      These are the communities
           of the Levites, according to the houses of their families.
       21       To the Gersonites belong the community of the Lobenites,
       22 and the community of the Semeites.         These are the commu-

              the sanctuary which were used in the priest's office ; and the

        33           To the Merarites belonged the community of Mooli, and

      39     The whole muster of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron
         reviewed, by the command of the Lord, according to their
         communitiesâ€”all the males, from a month old and upwards,
         were twenty two thousand.
      40     Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Review all the
         male first born of the children of Israel, from one month old
      41 and upwards, and take the number by name.       And thou shalt
         take the Levites for me    I the Lord ; instead of all the first
         born sons of Israel ; and the cattle of the Levites instead of
         all the firstlings of the cattle belonging to the children of
      42 Israel.   So Moses reviewed, in the manner the Lord com-
      43 manded, all the male first born among the Israelites ; and all
         the first born males, numbered by name, from one month old
         and upwards, were twenty two thousand two hundred and se-
      44 venty three.   Whereupon the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
      45 Take the Levites, instead of all the first born of the children
         of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites, for the firstlings of their
      46 cattle ; and the Levites shall belong to me   I the Lord.  And
         as redemption money for the two hundred and seventy three,
      47 of the first born, more than the Levites, thou shalt take from
         the first born of the children of Israel, five shekels a poll.Ac-
         cording to the holy didrachm, thou shall receive twenty oboli
      48 for a shekel.  And thou shalt give the money to Aaron and
         his sons, as the redemption of the overplus among the Israel-
      49 ites.  So Moses took the redemption money, for those who ex-
      50 ceeded the redemption made by the Levites.       From the first
         born of the children of Israel he took the money, amounting
      51 to one thousand three hundred and sixty five shekels accord-
         ing to the holy shekel, and gave the redemption money for
         the overplus to Aaron and his sons, by the command of the
         Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.

          with it cover the ark of the testimony, and put thereon the co-
       6 vering of blue skins ; and over it they shall spread a mantle,
       7 wholly blue, and put in the staves.               Then over the presence
          table they shall spread a mantle, all of purple ; upon it, and upon
          the platters, and the censers, and the goblets, and the libation

       8 are continually thereon shall be upon it.             And they shall throw

          all the utensils thereof, into a blue skin covering, and lay it on
      11 the staves to carry it.        They shall then cover the golden altar
           with a blue mantle, and spread over it a skin covering of blue,
      12 and put in the staves thereof to carry it.               And they shall take
           all the utensils used in the service, all with which they minister
           in the holies, and put them into a blue mantle, and cover them
           with a skin covering of blue, and lay them on staves to carry

          of Israel did so.   They sent them away out of the camp, as the
        5 Lord commanded Moses.          And when they had done so, the

         dust which is on the floor of the tabernacle of the testimony,
      18 the priest shall put it in the water.      And the priest shall pre-
         sent the woman before the Lord, and uncover the woman's
         head.    Then he shall put the sacrifice of remembranceâ€”the
         sacrifice of jealousy into her hands ; and in the hand of the
         priest shall be the water of discovery over which an impreca-
     19 tion is to be made ; and the priest shall adjure the woman, and
         say to her, If no man hath lain with thee ; if thou hast not trans-
         gressed, so as to be defiled, while under the jurisdiction of thy
         husband ; be thou uninjured by this tvater of discovery, over which
     20 an imprecation is to be made: but if thou hast transgressed, being
         a married woman, or art 'polluted, and any person besides thy hus-
     21 band hath lain with thee, (then the priest shall adjure the wo-
         man with solemn imprecations, and the priest shall say to the
         woman) the Lord make thee a curse and an imprecation in the
         midst of thy people, by causing thy thigh to rot, and thy belly
     22 to be inflamed.     Let this water over which this imprecation is
         made, go into thy belly, to inflame thy belly, and rot thy thigh.
     23 And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.            Then the priest shall
         write these curses in a book, and dip it in the water of disco-
     24 very, over which the imprecation was made, and shall cause
         the woman to drink the water of discovery, over which the
         imprecation was made.      And the water of discovery, over which
     25 the imprecation was made, shall go into herâ€”(The priest shall

         the priest shall have taken a handful of the sacrifice, the memo-

              28 woman shall be a curse among her people.                                                                     But if the woman be
                       not polluted, and be pure, she shall be uninjured, and shall con-
               29 ceive seed.                       This is the law of jealousy, when a woman who is
                       married transgresseth and is polluted ; or when a spirit of jea-
              30 lousy cometh on a man.                                              When he is jealous of her, and shall
                      set his wife before the Lord, the priest shall do to her all that
                      this law directeth ; so shall the man be free from sin, and the
                      woman shall bear her iniquity.
              VI.                Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the
                 2 children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, When a man
                      or a woman shall make a solemn vow to preserve the strictest
                      purity for the Lord, they must abstain from wine, and strong
                 3 drink.                 Such a one shall not drink vinegar made of wine, nor
                      vinegar made of strong drink ; nor shall such a one drink any
                      thing made of the grape ; nor eat any grapes, fresh pulled, or
                 4 dryed, all the days of the vow.                                                        From every thing produced
                      from the grape, including wine ; from the pulp to the stone,
                 5 such a one shall abstain all the days of the purification.                                                                                    A ra-

                6 vowed to the Lord be fulfilled.                                                       Being hallowed, he shall let
                      the hair of his head grow all the days of his vow to the Lord.
                 7 He shall not come near any dead body.                                                                   For a father or a mo-

               10 he is cleansed.                             On the seventh day it shall be shaved, and on
                      the eighth day he shall bring two turtle doves, or two young
                      pigeons to the priest, to the doors of the tabernacle of the tes-

                      the other for a whole burnt offering ; and the priest shall make
                      atonement for him for the failures of which he hath been guilty

                 former days shall not be counted, because the head of his
          13 vow was defiled.                                Now this is the law of him who hath made
          1  1 the vowâ€”When the days of his vow are fulfilled ; he shall bring
                  to the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony and present as
                  his gift to the Lord, a lamb of the first year without blemish
                  for a whole burnt offering, and a ewe lamb of the first year with-

          15 an offering of thanksgiving, and a basket of unleavened bread,
                  of fine flourâ€”the loaves tempered with oil, and unleavened
                 cakes anointed with oil, and their sacrifice of flour and their
         10 libation : and the priest shall offer them before the Lord.                                                                                   When
                 he hath offered the sin offering and the whole burnt offering,
         17 he shall then offer the ram, the sacrifice of thanksgiving to the
                 Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread.                                                                         And when the
                 priest hath offered the sacrifice thereof, and the libation thereof,
         18 then he who made the vow shall have the head of his vow shav-

                 the hairs on the fire which is under the sacrifice of thanksgiv-

                 and one unleavened loaf from the basket, and one unleavened
                 cake, and lay them on the hands of him who made the vow,
         20 after he hath shaved his consecrated head ; and the priest shall
                 offer these as a dedication laid on hands before the Lord.                                                                                        It

                 him who hath made the vowâ€”who may have vowed to the
                 Lordâ€”his gift to the Lord for his vow, besides what he may
                 be able to do more, according to the nature of the vow which
                 he may have made, according to the law of strict purity.
         22              Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,                                                                               Speak to
         23 Aaron and his sons and say, In this manner you shall bless
         24 the children of Israel, saying, The Lord bless thee and keep
         25 theeâ€”The Lord make his countenance to shine upon thee,
        20 and be gracious to theeâ€”The Lord lift up his countenance
        27 upon thee, and give thee peace.                                                      So they shall put my name on
                 the children of Israel ; and I the Lord will bless them.

                had anointed them, and hallowed them, the chiefs of Israel,
                the twelve chiefs of the houses of their head families who were
                the chiefs of the tribes, the same who attended at the review,
            3 made an offering, and brought as their gifts before the Lord,
                six covered waggons, and twelve oxen, a waggon from two
            4 chiefs, and an ox from each one.                         And when they had brought
            5 them before the Lord, the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Re-
                ceive them from them, and they shall be for the works of the
                service of the tabernacle of the testimony ; and thou shalt give
                them to the Levites, to each community according to their
            6 service.         So Moses, having taken the waggons and the oxen,
            7 gave them to the Levitesâ€”he gave two waggons and four ox-
            8 en to the Gersonites, according to their service ; and four wag-
                gons and eight oxen, he gave to the Merarites, according to
            9 their service, by Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.                                      But to
                the Kaathites he gave none, because they having the sacred
                services of the sanctuary, are to carry on their shoulders.
           10         The chiefs tendered also an offering for the dedication of
                the altar, on the day he anointed it.                              But when the chiefs
                brought their gift over against the altar, at some distance from
           11 it, the Lord said to Moses, One chief a day.                                 Let them bring
                forward, every chief his gifts on his day, for the dedication of
           12 the altar.          So he who brought forward his gifts on the first day,
           13 was Naasson, son of Aminadab chief of the tribe of Judas
                and he offered as his gift, one silver charger, the weight of
                which was a hundred and thirty shekels, one silver cup of se-

                 the tribe of Issachar made his offering; and lie presented as

      which was a hundred and thirty shekels ; one silver cup of se-
      venty shekels, after the holy shekel, both full of fine flour,
      made up with oil, for a sacrifice ; one censer of ten shekels of

      the first year.This was the gift of Phagael, son of Echran.
   78   On the twelfth day, the chief of the Xephthaleimites, Achire,

      giving, two heifers, five rams, five he-goats, five ewe lambs of
     the first year.This was the gift of Achire, son of Ainan.
   84   This was the dedication of the altar, when he anointed it,
     from the chiefs of the Israelites, twelve silver chargers, twelve
   85 silver cups, twelve censers of gold, each charger one hundred
     and thirty shekels, and each cup seventy shekels, all the silver
   86 of these vessels, two thousand four hundred shekels, and the
     shekels were after the holy shekel ; twelve golden censers, full
     of incense ; all the gold of the censers was one hundred and
   87 twenty shekels.All the cattle for the whole burnt offering
                                                                                                                             ;;

                were twelve young bulls, twelve rams, twelve lambs of the
                first year, with their sacrifices of flour and their libations; and
          88 twelve kids of the goats for the sin offering.                                     All the cattle for
                the sacrifice of thanksgiving, were twenty four heifers, sixty
                rams, sixty he-goats, sixty ewe lambs of the first year, without
                 blemish.          This was the dedication of the altar.
          89          After filling his own hands, and after the anointing, when
                Moses went into the tabernacle of the testimony to speak to the
                Lord, he heard the voice of the Lord speaking to him, from
                above the propitiatory, which is over the ark of the testimony,
                between the two cherubims, and he answered him, and the
          VIII.             Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to Aaron, and thou
            2 shalt say to him, When thou hast put on the side lamps, the
                seven lamps shall give light in a range with the front of the
            3 candlestick.              And Aaron did so.                       On each side, on a range
                with the front of the candlestick, he lighted the lamps thereof
            4 as the Lord commanded Moses.                                      Now the workmanship of
                the candlestick was of solid gold ; both its stem, and its lillies,
                were of one solid piece.                     He had made the candlestick accord-
                ing to the pattern which the Lord shewed Moses.
            5         Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Take the Le-
            6 vites from among the children of Israel, and purify them.                                               And
            7 in this manner thou shalt perform their purification.                                         Thoushalt
                sprinkle them with the water of purification, and a razor shall
                pass over their whole body, and they shall wash their clothes,
            8 and they will be clean.                     Then they shall take a young bull from
                the herd, with his sacrifice, to wit, fine flour mixed up with oil
                and thou shalt take a yearling bull from the herd for a sin of-
            9 fering, and bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the testi-
          10 mony, and assemble all the congregation of Israel's sons, and
                present the Levites before the Lord.                                 And the sons of Israel
          11 shall lay their hands on the Levites ; and Aaron shall set the
                Levites apart before the Lord, as a gift from the sons of Israel
                and they shall be set apart to perform the works of the Lord.
          12 Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the head of the
                young bulls.              And thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering,
                and the other for a whole burnt offering, to make atonement
          13 for them.              Then thou shalt place the Levites before the Lord,
                and before Aaron and before his sons, and give them as a gift
      Oli. IX.                   NUMBERS.
      14 before the Lord.     80 thou shalt separate the Levites from
         among the children of Israel, and they shall belong to me.
      15 And after this, the Levites shall go in to do the works of the
         tabernacle of the testimony, when thou hast purified them, and
      16 given them up before the Lord.      Because they are solemnly
         given up to me from among the children of Israel ; I have
         taken them for myself from among the children of Israel, in-
         stead of all the males who are the first born of their mothers.
      17 Because every first born among the children of Israel, whether
     18 of man or beast, belongeth to me (on the day when I smote
         all the first born in the land of Egypt, I hallowed them for
         myself) and I have taken the Levites instead of all the first
      19 born among the children of Israel, and have given the Levites
         as a gift to Aaron and his sons, from among the children of Is-
         rael, to do the works of the children of Israel at the tabernacle
         of the testimony, and to make atonement for the children of
         Israel ; therefore none among the children of Israel shall come
         near the Holies.
     20     So Moses and Aaron, and all the congregation of the chil-
         dren of Israel, did to the Levites as the Lord commanded Mo-
         ses in respect to them.
     21     Now when the children of Israel had done so to them, and
         the Levites were purified, and had washed their clothes, and
         Aaron had solemnly given them up in the presence of the
     22 Lord, and had made atonement for them to purify them ; and,
         after this, the Levites had gone in to perform their service in
         the tabernacle of the testimony, in the presence of Aaron and
         his sonsâ€”when they had done thus for the Levites, as the Lord
         had commanded Moses in respect to them ; then the Lord
     23 spoke to Moses, saying, There is this further in respect to the
     24 Levitesâ€”from twenty five years and upwards, they shall go in
      25 to perform service at the tabernacle of the testimony ; but af-
         ter fifty years of age, they are to be withdrawn from the ser-
      26 vice, and work no more.    As brothers, they are to keep watch
         at the tabernacle of the testimony, but not to perform labo-
         rious work.  In this manner thou shalt dispose of the Levites
         among their watches.
      IX.     Now in the second year after their coming out of the land of
         Egypt, in the first month, the Lord spoke to Moses in the
                                                                                                                                         :
           Ch. IX.                                             NUMBERS.
             2 wilderness of Sina, saying, Give orders, and let the children of
             3 Israel keep the passover in its appointed season.                                                  On the four-
                 teenth day of this first month, towards evening, thou shalt cele-
                 brate it in its season.                     According to its rites, and according to
             4 its       institution, thou shalt celebrate it.                                       Accordingly Moses
                 spoke to the children of Israel to keep the passover on the
             5 fourteenth day of the first month, in the wilderness of Sina.
                 And when the children of Israel were doing as the Lord com-
             6 manded Moses, there were some men who were defiled by the
                 dead body of a man, and could not keep the passover ; so
                 these men came to Moses and Aaron on that day, and said to
             7 them, We are defiled by the dead body of a man, must we
                 therefore be deprived of the opportunity of offering our gift to
                 the Lord, in its appointed season, among the children of Israel
             8 whereupon Moses said to them, Stand here ; and I will hear
             9 what the Lord will command concerning you.                                                     Then the Lord
                 spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, and
           10 say, If any man among you, or among your posterity, happen
                 to be defiled by the dead, or be on a far distant journey, he
           11 shall keep the passover to the Lord in the second month.                                                               On
                 the fourteenth day they shall keep it towards evening.                                                         They
           12 shall eat it with unleavened bread, and bitter herbs ; they shall
                 not leave any of it till the morning ; nor shall they break a
           13 bone ofit. They shall keep it according to the ritual of the pass-
                 over.        And if any man be clean, and not on a distant journey,
                 and fail to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from
                 among his people ; because he did not offer this gift to the
           14 Lord, in its appointed time, such a man shall bear his sin.                                                         And
                 if there come to you a proselyte in your land, and he chuse to
                 keep the passover to the Lord, he must keep it according to
                 its ritual, and according to its institution.                                        You shall have one
                 law for the proselyte and for him born in the land.
           15           Now on the day when the tabernacle was erected, the cloud
                 covered the tabernacleâ€”the house of the testimony : and in
                 the evening there was over the tabernacle an appearance like
                 that of fire, which continued till the morning.                                           Thus it was con-
          16 tinually.               The cloud covered it by day : and there was an ap-
          17 pearance of fire during the night.                                     And when the cloud ascend-
                 ed from the tabernacle, the Israelites thereupon began their

    Ch.
        march ; and at what place soever the cloud halted there the Is-
    18 raelites encamped. By the command of the Lord the Israelites
        were to encamp, and by the command of the Lord, they were
        to march. All the time the cloud overshadowed the taberna-
     19 cle, the Israelites were to continue encamped.And when the
        cloud was continued over the tabernacle many days, the Israel-
     20 ites were to keep the watch of their God, and not remove.And
        such was to be the case when the cloud overshadowed the ta-
        bernacle but a few days. At the command of the Lord, they
        were to encamp ; and at the command of the Lord, they were to
     21 march.  And this was to be the case when the cloud was from
        evening till morning. When the cloud ascended in the morn-
        ning, they were to take up their march, whether it was day or
     22 night.  But while the cloud continued to overshadow it, even
        for a month or more, the Israelites were to continue encamped,
        and not remove.
     23    Because at the command of the Lord, they were to move,
        and at the command of the Lord, by the ministry of Moses,
        they kept the watch of the Lord ; therefore the Lord spoke to
     X.     Moses, saying, Make for thyself two silver trumpets.Thou
      2 shalt make them of ductile silver, each beaten out of one piece.
        And they shall serve thee to assemble the congregation, and to
      3 cause the camps to remove.  When thou shalt blow with them,
      4 all the congregation shall assemble at the door of the taberna-
        cle of the testimony ; but when one is blown, all the chiefs, the
      5 leaders of Israel, shall come to thee.When you blow an alarm,
      6 the camps on the east shall begin their march ; and when you
        blow a second alarm, the camps on the south shall begin their
        march ; and when you blow a third alarm, the camps on the
        west shall begin their march ; and when you blow a fourth
      7 alarm, the camps on the north shall begin their march. They
         shall blow an alarm for their marching.And when you would
         assemble the congregation, you are to blow with them, but not
      8 an alarm.  The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trum-
         pets. This shall be a perpetual ordinance for you, throughout
       9 your generations.  And when you go out to battle in your
         land, against your enemies, who have risen up against you,
         you shall sound these trumpets, that you may be brought into
         remembrance before the Lord, and saved from your enemies.
      Ch. X.                     NUMBERS.
      10 In the days of your rejoicings also, and at your festivals, and
         at your new moons, you shall blow the trumpets, at your
         whole burnt offerings, and at your sacrifices of thanksgivings ;
         and it shall be a calling of you into remembrance before the
         Lordâ€”I the Lord your God.
      11     Now in the second year, in the second month, on the twen-
         tieth day of the month, the cloud ascended from the tabernacle
      12 of the testimony ; whereupon the Israelites with their baggage,
         marched through the wilderness of Sina, and the cloud halted
      13 in the wilderness of Pharan.  When the first had begun their
      14 marchâ€”when the van, the division of the camp of Judas, had
      15 marched, and at the head of it Naasson son of Aminadab, and
      16 at the head of the army of the tribe of Issachar, Nathaniel son
         of Sogar, and at the head of the army of the tribe of Zabulon,
      17 Eliab son of Chailon; then were the Gersonites, and the Me-
         rarites, having taken down the tabernacle, to move on, carry-
      18 ing the tabernacle.   And when the division of the camp of
         Reuben had marched with their army, and at the head of it
      19 Elisur son of Sedur ; and at the head of the army of the tribe
      20 of Symeon, Salamiel son of Surisadai ; and at the head of the
      21 army of the tribe of Gad, Elisaph son of Raguel, then were
         the Kaathites to move on, carrying the holy things, so that
      22 the tabernacle might be set up when they arrived.   Then were
          to march the division of the camp of Ephraim, with their ar-
      23 my, and at the head of it Elisama son of Emiud ; and at the
          head of the army of the tribe of Manasses, Gamaliel son of
      24 Phadassur ; and at the head of the army of the tribe of Benja-
      25 min, Abidan son of Gadeoni.     And the division of the camp
          of Dan were to march the last of all the camps, with their ar-
      26 my, and at the head of it Achiezer son of Amisadai ; and at the
      27 head of the army of the tribe of Aser, Phagael son of Echran ;
      28 and at the head of the army of the tribe of Nephthaleim, Achire
          son of Ainan.  These were the armies of the Israelites.
      29     Now when they began their march Moses said to Obad,
          son of Raguel the Madianite, the brother in law of Moses,
          We are now on our march to the place which the Lord said,
          This I will give you. Come with us and we will deal well with
          thee ; for the Lord hath spoken good things concerning Israel.
       30 In reply to which he said, I cannot go, but must return to my
                                                                                                               ;

        31 own land, and to my family.                          Whereupon Moses said, Thou
             must not leave us.                Because thou hast been with us in the
             wilderness, therefore thou shalt be a senator among us, and
        32 shalt shareâ€”if thou go with us, thou shalt indeed share in all
             those good things which the Lord will bestow upon us, and
             we will deal kindly with thee.
       33         So they removed from the mount of the Lord, three days'
            journey, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before
             them the three days' journey, to look out for them a resting
       35 place.         And when the ark set forward Moses said, Arise, O
             Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered.                      Let them who hate thee
        36 be put to flight.               And when it halted he said, Return,                          Lord,
             to the thousand myriads of Israel.
       34         Now while the cloud was overshadowing them by day,
             as they marched out of the camp, the people were wickedly
       XL           murmuring before the Lord, and the Lord heard, and was
            provoked to wrath, and a fire from the Lord was kindled
         2 among them, and was consuming part of the camp, whereupon
            the people cried to Moses, and he prayed to the Lord, and
         3 the fire ceased.             So the name of that place was called Burn-
            ing, because a fire from the Lord had been kindled among
            them.
         4        Again the mixed multitude which was among them had
            a longing desire, and even the children of Israel sat down and
         5 wept, saying, Who will give us flesh to eat.                              We recollect the
            fish which we ate in Egypt for nothing ; and the cucumbers, and
            the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the cloves of
         6 garlick ; but now our soul is dried up, and our eyes behold
         7 nothing but this manna.                    Now the manna was like a grain of
            coriander, and its colour was the colour of chrystal, and the
         8 people went out, and gathered it and ground it in mills, or beat
            it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, or made it up into cakes to
            be baked on the hearth ; and in sweetness its taste was that of a
         9 sweet cake, made with oil ; and when the dew fell on the camp
            the manna came down with it.
       10         When Moses heard them weeping in their communities,
            every one at his tent door, though the Lord was greatly pro-
            voked to wrath, and in the view of Moses it was evil, yet
       11 Moses said to the Lord, Why hast thou afflicted thy servant
                  VOL. I.                                H h

          and why have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou
       12 shouldst lay upon me the weight of this people ?Have I con-
          ceived all this people ? Or have I brought them forth, that
          thou sayest to me, Take them in thy bosom, and carry them,
          as a nurse would her sucking child, to the land which with
       13 an oath thou hast promised to their fathers? Whence can I
          have flesh to give to all this people ? For they weep before me,
       14 saying, Give us flesh that we may eat.I am not able alone to
       15 bear this people. It is a burden too heavy for me.  If thou
          deal thus with me, kill me outright, if I have found favour in
       16 thy sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.  Whereupon
          the Lord said to Moses, Assemble before me seventy men
          of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be elders of the
          people, and their scribes ; and bring them to the tabernacle
       17 of the testimony, and let them stand there with thee ; and I
          will come down and talk with thee there, and I will take a
          portion of the spirit which is upon thee, and put it upon
          them ; and they will help thee to bear the burden of this people,
       18 so that thou shalt not bear them thyself alone.  And thou
          shalt say to this people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow,
          and you shall eat flesh. Because you have wept before the
          Lord, saying, Who can give us flesh to eat ? It is better for
          us to be in Egypt ; therefore the Lord will give you flesh to
       19 eat, and you shall eat flesh.You shall eat it, not one day, nor
          two days, nor five days, nor ten nor twenty days. You shall
       20 eat it a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and
          become loathsome to you, because you have distrusted the
          Lord who is amongst you, and have wept in his presence,
          and said, Why did we come out of Egypt.    Thereupon Moses
       21 said, The people among whom I am, are six hundred thou-
          sand footmen, yet thou hast said, I will give them flesh to eat,
       22 and they shall eat it a whole month.Must the flocks and the
          herds be slaughtered for them? Will even these suffice? Or
          should all the fish of the sea be collected for them, would this be
       23 sufficient for them ? And the Lord said to Moses, Cannot the
          hand of the Lord furnish a sufficiency ? Thou shalt now see whe-
       24 ther my word shall come to pass to thee or not. Then Moses went
          out, and told the people the words of the Lord.And when he
          had assembled seventy men from among the elders of the peo-

         pie, and placed them around the tabernacle, the Lord descend-
     25 ed in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took a portion of the spi-
         rit which was upon him, and put it on the seventy elders.     And
     26 soon as the spirit rested on them, they prophesied.     Now there
         were two who had not joined them, but were left in the camp.
         The name of the one was Eldad and the name of the other,
         Modad ; and the spirit rested on them.       They were of those
         who were written down, but they had not come to the taber-
     27 nacle.   And when they prophesied in the camp, there ran a
     28 young man, who told Moses, saying, Eldad and Modad are
         prophesying in the camp.        Upon which Joshua the son of
         Nave, who was the chosen attendant of Moses, addressing
     29 him said, My lord Moses, forbid them.         But Moses said to
         him, Thou shouldst not envy, on my account.              that the
         people of the Lord had all been made prophets when the Lord
     30 put his spirit on these !   Then Moses went into the camp, ac-
     31 companied with the elders of Israel ; and there went forth a
         wind from the Lord, and brought a flock of quails from the sea,
         and drove them upon the camp, a day's journey on this side,
         and a day's journey on that side, all around the camp about
     32 two cubits from the ground.        Whereupon the people arose,
         and all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, they
         gathered the flocks of quails, and he who gathered the fewest
     33 collected ten cores.    Though they had heated for themselves
         kilns all around the camp, the flesh was already between their
         teeth before it was quite dead.     Whereupon the wrath of the
         Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the
     34 people with a very great plague, so that the name of that place
         was called Monuments of longing desire; because they had
         there buried the people who had expressed such a longing
         desire.
      35     From the Monuments of longing desire, the people removed
     XII.     to Aseroth ; and while they were at Aseroth, Mariam and
         Aaron spoke against Moses, because of the Ethiopian woman
       2 whom Moses had taken ; because he had taken to wife an
         Ethiopian woman, therefore they said, Hath the Lord spoken
       3 to Moses only ? Hath he not spoken to us also ? (Now the
         man Moses was very meek, above all the men on the earth,)
         And when the Lord heard, the Lord immediately said to 31o-

          ses, and Aaron, and Mariam.    Come forth you three to the ta-
       4 bernacle of the testimony.    And when they three came out to
       5 the tabernacle of the testimony, the Lord descended in a pillar
          of cloud, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of the testi-
       6 mony, and Aaron and Mariam were called.           And when they
          both came out he said to them, Hear my words.      If there be a
          prophet among you to the Lord, I will make myself known to
       7 him by a vision, and speak to him in sleep.   Not so with respect
       8 to my servant Moses.    In all my house he is faithful.  Mouth to
          mouth, I will speak to him personally, and not in dark senten-
          ces.  He hath actually seen the glory of God.    Why then were
          ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses.
       9     And the wrath of the Lord was upon them, and the cloud
          withdrew from the tabernacle, and behold Mariam was le-
      10 prous like snow.     When Aaron looked on Mariam, and be-
          hold she was leprous, he said to Moses, O my lord, impute
      11 not sin to us, because we have acted ignorantlyâ€”because we
      12 have sinned, Let her not be as dead, as an abortive, for it de-
      13 voureth the half of her flesh.   Whereupon Moses cryed to the
      14 Lord, saying,     God, I beseech thee, heal her.   And the Lord
          said to Moses, If her father had spit in her face, would she
          not be ashamed seven days ?    Let her be set apart seven days,
      15 without the camp, and after that let her come in.      So Mariam
          was set apart without the camp, seven days, and the people did
      XIII.      not remove till Mariam was cleansed.       And after this
          the people removed from Aseroth, and encamped in the wil-
       2 derness of Pharan.     And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
          Send men, and let them examine for thee the land of the Cha-
          nanites, which I am about to give to the children of Israel for
          a possession.  Thou shalt send a man for every tribe ; accord-
          ing to the communities of their patriarchal families, thou shalt
          send them, every one a leader among them.
        3     So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Pharan, by the
       4 command of the Lord.       All the men were principal officers of
          the children of Israel, and these were their namesâ€”Of the
          tribe of Reuben, Samuel, son of Zachur ; of the tribe of Sy-
          meon, Saphat, son of Suri ; Of the tribe of Judas, Chaleb, son
          of Jephonne ; of the tribe of Issachar, Ilaal, son of Joseph ;
          of the tribe of Ephraim, Ause, son of Nave ; of the tribe of Ben-

         Ch. XIII.                                          NUMBERS.
               jamin, Phalti, son of Raphu ; of the tribe of Zabulon, Gudiel,
               son of Sudi ; of the tribe of Josephâ€”of the Manassites, Gad-
               di, son of Susi ; of the tribe of Dan, Amiel, son of Gamali ; of
               the tribe of Aser, Sathur, son of Michael ; of the tribe of
               Nephthaleim, Nabi, son of Sabi ; of the tribe of Gad, Gudiel,
               son of Makchi.
         16           These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to exa-
               mine the land : (now Moses had surnamed Anse, son of Nave,
         17 Joshua.)              And upon sending them to view the land of Ohanaan,
         18 Moses said to them, Having gone up through this wilderness,
               you shall go up to the mountain, and view the land, of what sort
               it is; and the people who are settled in it, whether they be
         19 strong or weak ; whether few or many ; and what sort of a
               country it is in which they are settled, whether it is good or
               bad ; and what sort of cities they inhabit, whether they dwell
        20 in cities with walls, or without walls ; and what the quality of the
               soil is, whether rich or poor ; and whether there are trees there,
               or not.         And having made a strict examination, you will bring
               with you some of the fruits of the land : (for their days, it being
               then the spring season, would reach to the time of the first ripe
        21 grapes.)               So they went up, and viewed the country from the
        22 wilderness of Sin, as far as Roob on the way to Aimath.                                                           Then
               they went up, on a course parallel with the front of the desart
               then turned down to Chebron, where were the Achimans and
              the Sessians, and the Thelamins, descendants of Enach.                                                          Now
        23 Chebron was built seven years before Tanis in Egypt.                                                               And
               having come to the valley of grapes, and viewed it, they cut
              there a branch with a cluster of grapes on it, and carried it on
        24 poles, with some pomegranates and figs : and they called the
              name of that place, Valley of Grapes; because of the bunch
        25 of grapes which the children of Israel cut there.                                                    And having
              viewed the land, they set out thence on their return, after forty
        26 days, and journeying on came to Moses and Aaron, and to all
              the congregation of the Israelites in the wilderness of Pharan
              Kades, and made report to them and to all the congregation,
        27 and shewed them the fruit of the land.                                            And they gave him a
              minute detail and said, We went to the country to which thou
              didst send us, a land flowing with milk and honey, and this
        28 is the fruit of it.                      But nevertheless because the nation which

                   tites, and the Evites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, in-
                   habit the hilly country ; and the Chananites dwell on the sea

                   people before Moses, and said, We have only to go up, and

                   who went up with him said) We will not go up ; for we are not
                   able to go up against that nation ; for it is much more power-

                   The land through which we passed to view it, is a land
                   which devoureth them who dwell therein ; and all the people
            33 which we saw are men of immense stature.                                                    There indeed we
            XIV.              saw the giants, and we were before them like grasshop-

                   all the congregation, raising their voices, shouted aloud, and
              2 the people wept that whole night.                                      And all the Israelites mur-

                  said to them,                  that we had died in the land of Egypt, or even
              3 in this wilderness !                       If we must die, why doth the Lord lead
                   us into that land to fall in battle?                                 Our wives and our children
                   will be for a prey.                    Now therefore it is better for us to return
              4 to Egypt.                 Then they said to one another, Let us appoint a
              5 leader, and return to Egypt.                                 Upon this Moses and Aaron fell
                   on their faces before all the congregation of the children of Is-
               6 rael, and Joshua the son of Xave, and Chaleb the son of Je-
                   phonne, two of them who had viewed the land, rent their
               7 clothes, and spoke to all the congregation of the Israelites, say-
               8 ing, The land which we viewed is indeed a most excellent
                   land.        If the Lord delighteth in us, he will lead us to that land,
               9 and give it to us.                        It is a land flowing with milk and honey.
                   Only rebel not against the Lord, and you need not be afraid of
                   the people of the land, for they are food for us.                                            For their time
             10 is over, and the Lord is with us.                                     Fear them not.                    And when
                   all the congregation ordered to stone them with stones, the
                   glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud, over the tabernacle
             11 of the testimony, to all the children of Israel.                                                 And the Lord

               said to Moses, How long shall this people provoke me ?                                                          And
               how long will they disbelieve me, notwithstanding all the mi-
         12 racles which I have done among them ?                                                Let me smite them
               with pestilence and destroy them, and I will make thee and
               the house of thy father a great nation and much more nume-
         13 rous than this.                     Thereupon Moses said to the Lord, Though
               Egypt may publish that thou by thy mighty power didst bring
         14 this people out from among themâ€”Nay though all the inhabi-
                tants of this land have heard that thou the Lord art among this
               peopleâ€”that they with their eyes may behold thee,                                                             Lord,
               exposed to view ; and that thy cloud hath stood over them, and
               that thou marchest before them in a pillar of cloud by day, and
               in a pillar of fire by night ; yet when thou shalt destroy this
         lo people as one man, then will all the nations who have heard of
         16 thy name speak, saying, Because the Lord was not able to
               bring this people into the land which, with an oath, he promised
                                                                                                                         7  there-
         17 them, he hath destroyed them in the wilderness.                                                       Now
               fore let thy power,                        Lord, be exalted.                    As thou hast spoken,
               saying, " The Lord is long suffering, abundant in mercy and
         18 true, taking away iniquities, transgressions and sins ; and, when
               he will not by purification clear the guilty, retributing the sins
               of fathers on children to the third and fourth generation,"
         19 forgive the sin of this people according to thy great mercy, as
                thou hast been gracious to them from Egypt even to this time.
         20 Then the Lord said to Moses, I am merciful to them accord-
         21 ing to thy word.                       But as I live, and my name liveth, and the
         22 glory of the Lord shall fill the whole earth ; because all these
               men, who have seen my glory, and the wonders which I have
               done in Egypt, and in this wilderness, have actually tempted
         23 me now the tenth time, and have not hearkened to my voice,
                they indeed shall not see the land which I, with an oath, pro-
                mised their fathers.                    But with regard to their children who are
                here with meâ€”as many as have not known good or evilâ€”every
                one who is too young to be taught by experience, to them I
         24 will give the land. As for all them who have provoked me, they
                shall not see it ; But with regard to my servant Chaleb, be-
                cause there was a different spirit in him, and he followed me,
                him I will bring into the land to which he went, and his seed
         25 shall inherit it.                    Now the Amalekites and the Chananites dwell

           wilderness by the way to the Red sea.
       26     Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
       27 How long shall I bear with this wicked congregation?      I have
          heard what they murmur before meâ€”the murmuring of the
          Israelites which they have uttered concerning you, Say to
       28 them, As I live, saith the Lord, As you have spoken in my
       29 hearing, so will I actually do to you. In this wilderness your car-
          casses shall fallâ€”the whole review of youâ€”even all of you who
          have been reviewed, from twenty years old, and upwards, who
       30 have murmured against me.      None of you shall come into that
          land, respecting which I stretched forth my hand to cause you
          to dwell therein, save only Chaleb son of Jephonne, and Joshua
       31 son of Nave.    But as for your children, which you said would
          be for a prey, them I will bring into the land, and they shall
       32 inherit that land which you have rejected.   Your carcasses shall
          fall in this wilderness, and in this wilderness your children shall
       33 be fed forty years.   They shall bear your whoredom until your
       34 carcasses are consumed in the wilderness.      According to the
          number of days in which you explored the land, counting
          each of the forty days a year, you shall bear your sins forty
          years, and shall know the vengeance of my wrath.     I the Lord
       35 have spoken.    In this manner I will assuredly deal with this
       36 wicked congregation, which hath risen up against me.      In this
          wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die,
          with those men whom Moses sent to view the land, and who,
          on their return, murmured against it before the congregation,
       37 to raise an evil report concerning it.  Now the men who spoke
       38 ill against the land were struck dead before the Lord, and Jo-
          shua son of Nave and Chaleb son of Jephonne alone survived
          of all the men who had gone to view the land.
       39     When Moses rehearsed these words to all the children of Is-
       40 rael, the people mourned exceedingly, and rising early the next
          morning they went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Be-
          hold, here we are, we will go up to the place which the Lord
       41 hath said, for we have sinned.     Though Moses said, Why do
          you transgress the command of the Lord ?        Things will not
       42 prosper with you.   Do not go up, for the Lord is not with you.
       43 You will therefore fall before the face of your enemies.     Be-
      Ch. XV.                              NUMBERS.
           cause the Amalekites and the Chananites are there before you,
           you will therefore fall by the sword.              Because you have turned
           back, and disobeyed the Lord, therefore the Lord will not be
      44 among you.          Notwithstanding this, they obstinately went up to
           the top of the mountain ; but the ark of the covenant of the
      45 Lord, and Moses, did not depart out of the camp.                            And the
           Amalekites and the Chananites, who were in ambush on the
           mountain, came down, and drove them back, and smote them
           even to Ermon.          So they returned to the camp.
      XV.         Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the
        2 children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, When you are
        o come into the land of your habitation, which I give you, and
           thou wilt offer whole burnt offerings to the Lord, whether it
           be an offering of homage, or a sacrifice to magnify a vow, or
           a free will offering ; or at your festivals, to make a smell of fra-
           grance to the Lord ; if they be from the herds or the flocks, he
        4 who bringeth his gift to the Lord must also bring for a sacri-
           fice of flour, the tenth of an ephah of fine flour, made up with
        5 the fourth of an hin of oilâ€”and for a libation you shall pour
           the fourth of an hin of wine upon the whole burnt offering, or
           upon the sacrifice ;        for every lamb you shall do this, as an of-
        6 fering of homage, a smell of fragrance for the Lord : But for a
           ram, when you offer one, for a whole burnt offering, or for a
           sacrifice, thou shalt offer two tenths of fine flour, made up with
        7 the third of an hin of oil, for a sacrifice : and for a libation you
            shall offer a third of an hin of wine, for a smell of fragrance to
        8 the Lord.        And if you make your offering from the herds, for
            a whole burnt offering, or for a sacrifice to magnify a vow, or
        9 for an offering of thanksgiving to the Lord ; he who offereth
            must bring, with the young bull, three tenths of fine flour mix-
       10 ed up with the half of anjiin of oil, for a sacrifice; and the half
            of an hin of wine for a libation, as an offering of homage, a
       11 smell of fragrance for the Lord.                Thus thou shalt do for every
            young bull, or for every ram, or for every lamb, or kid of the
       12 goats.      According to the number which you offer, thus you
       13 shall do for every one, according to their number.                        Every one
            born in the land shall prepare these things in this manner, when
            he maketh offerings of homage for a smell of fragrance for the
       14 Lord.       And if there be a proselyte among you in your land, or

           whoever there may be among your generations, who will make
          an offering of homage, a smell of fragrance for the Lord, in
          the same manner as you do, so shall he do.         The congregation
           is the Lord's.
       ] 5     There shall be one law for you, and for the proselytes among
          yon is a perpetual law for your generations.     As you are, so shall
       16 the proselyte be before the Lord.       There shall be one law, and
          one rule of rectitude for you and for the proselyte settled
          among you.
       17     Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the chil-
       18 dren of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, When you come
          to the land to which I am conducting you, this must be done.
       19 When you are about to eat of the bread of the land, you shall
       20 set apart a separate portion as a dedication to the Lord.           As
          the first fruits of your dough you shalt set apart a loaf for this
       21 separate portion.     As a dedication from the threshing floor, so
          shall you set this apart, as the first portion of your dough, and
          you shall give it to the Lord as a dedication throughout your
       22 generations.    xVnd when you shall be guilty of a failure, and
          shall not have performed all these commands which the Lord
       23 hath delivered to Mosesâ€”even all that the Lord hath enjoined
           on you by the ministry of Moses, from the day the Lord gave
           them in charge to you, and thenceforward throughout your
       24 generations, then shall this be done.      If, escaping the notice of
           the congregation, it hath been done inadvertently, the whole
           congregation shall offer a young bull from the herd, without
           blemish, for a whole burnt offering, for a smell of fragrance
           for the Lord, with its sacrifice, and its libation, according to
           the rule prescribed, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.
       25 And the priest shall make atonement for the whole congrega-
           tion of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them.
           Because it was done through inadvertency, and they have
           brought their gift, an offering of homage to the Lord for their
       26 sin before the Lord, for their involuntary acts ; therefore for-
           giveness shall be extended to the whole congregation of the
           children of Israel, even to the stranger settled among you;
       27 because it was an act of ignorance in the whole people.           And
           if any individual sin ignorantly, he shall bring a she-goat of
       28 the first year for a sin offering ; and the priest shall make an
    Oh. XVI.                  NUMBERS.
       atonement for the person who hath been guilty through igno-
    29 ranee, and hath sinned inadvertently before the Lord. In mak-
        ing atonement for him who shall act inadvertently, there shall
        be the same law for the stranger among the children of Israel,
        and for the proselyte who hath joined them and sinned inad-
     30 vertently, as for them.But if any person, whether a native or
        a proselyte, shall presumptuously transgress, he provoketh
    31 God ; that person shall be cut off from among his people. Be-
        cause he hath despised the statute of the Lord, and hath bro-
        ken his commandments, that person shall be blotted out : his
        sin shall be upon him.
    32     When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they
    33 found a man gathering wood on the sabbath day.      And they
        who found him gathering wood on the sabbath day, brought
        him before Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation of
    34 the children of Israel ; and they committed him to custody,
        for it had not been determined what should be done to him.
    35 Whereupon the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Let the man
        be put to death. Let all the congregation stone him with stones.
     36 So all the congregation led him out of the camp, and the
        whole congregation stoned him with stones without the camp,
        as the Lord commanded Moses.
    37     Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the chil-
    38 dren of Israel, and thou shalt say to them.   Let them make
        for themselves tufts on the corners of their mantles, through-
        out all their generations ; and on the tufts at the corners you
        shall put a blue ribbon, and have it on the tufts, that when
     39 you see them you may remember all the commands of the
        Lord, and do them, and not turn aside after your imaginations,
        and your own eyes, by following of which you have gone a
     10 whoringâ€”that you may remember, and do all my commands,
     41 and be dedicated to your God.   I am the Lord your God, who
        brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God.   I the
        Lord am your God.
     XYI.      When Kore son of Issaar, son of Kaath, son of Levi,
        spoke, backed by Dathan and Abiron, the son of Eliab, and
      2 by Ami, son of Phaleth, son of Beuben,â€”when they rose up
        against Moses, with two hundred and hfty men of the sons of
        Israel, leaders of the congregation, eminent for counsel and

      Ch. XVI.                      NUMBERS.
        3 men of renownâ€”when they rose in a body against Moses and
          Aaron, and said, Be it known to yon that the whole congre-
          gation are holy, and the Lord is among them.           Why then do
       4 you set yourselves against the congregation of the Lord ? Mo-
          ses, upon hearing this, fell on his face, and spoke to Kore,
        5 and to all his company, saying, God hath seen and known
          who are his, and who are holy, and hath brought them near
        6 to himself.   Even those whom he chose he hath brought near to
        7 himself.   Do this.    Take for yourself censers, thou Kore, and
          all you his company; and put fire therein, and lay incense
        8 thereon before the Lord to-morrow.        And let the man whom
          the Lord hath chosen be the holy man.           Let this suffice you,
          ye sons of Levi.     Moreover, Moses said to Kore, Hearken to
        9 me, ye sons of Levi ; Is this a small thing to you, that the God
          of Israel hath separated you from among the congregation of
          Israel, and brought you near to himself, to perform the holy
          services of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to attend before
      10 the tabernacle to perform them ?       He hath indeed brought thee
          near, and all thy brethren the children of Levi with thee.    And do
      11 you seek in this manner to officiate also as priestsâ€”Thou and
          all this thy company who are tumultuously assembled before
          God? As for Aaron, who is he that you murmur against him ?
      1   Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiron, the sons of Eliab ;
      13 but they said we will not go up.      Is it a small matter that thou
          hast been bringing us up to a land flowing with milk and ho-
          ney, to kill us in this wilderness, that thou tyrannisest over us ?
       14 Thou art a chief! And thou hast brought us to a land flow-
          ing with milk and honey ! and hast given us a portion of land,
       15 and vineyards !     Fain wouldst thou put out the eyes of these
          men! We will not go up.          Upon this Moses was greatly in-
          censed, and said to the Lord, Eespect not their sacrifice.           I
          have not taken from any of them an object of desire, nor have
       16 I injured any of them.      Then Moses said to Kore, Hallow thy
           company and be ready before the Lord, thou and Aaron and
       17 they, to-morrow.     And take every one his censer, and put in-
           cense thereon, and present before the Lord, every one, his cen-
           ser, two hundred and fifty censers ; thou also and Aaron, each

       19 at the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony ; and Kore had
            collected against them all his company, at the doors of the ta-
            bernacle of the testimony, the glory of the Lord appeared to
       20 the whole congregation.                     And the Lord spoke to Moses and
       21 Aaron saying, Separate yourselves from among this congre-
       22 gation, and I will consume them all at once.                                At this they fell
            on their faces and said,                      God, the God of the spirits even
            of all flesh !        If one man hath sinned, is the wrath of the Lord
       23 against the whole congregation ?                        Then the Lord spoke to Mo-
            ses, saying, Speak to the congregation, and say, Withdraw all
       24 around from the congregation of Kore.                                  Accordingly Moses,
       25 arose, and went to Dathan and Abiron ; and all the elders of
       26 Israel accompanied him.                      And he spoke to the congregation,
            saying, Separate yourselves from the tents of these wicked
            men, and touch not any of the things which belong to them,
       27 lest you be consumed with them in their sins.                                 And when they
            had drawn back, all around, from the tent of Kore, Dathan
            and Abiron came out, and stood at the doors of their tents,
       28 with their wives and their children, and their attendants.                                     And
            Moses said, By this you shall know that the Lord hath sent
       29 me to do all these works, and that they are not of myself.â€”If
            these men die the common death of all men ; or if their vi-
            sitation be according to the visitation of all men, the Lord
       30 hath not sent me : but if the Lord demonstrate by a miracle,
            and the earth opening its mouth, shall swallow up them and
            their households, and their tents, and all that belong to them
            and they go down alive to the mansion of the dead ; then you
       31 will know that these men have provoked the Lord.                                      And when
            he had made an end of speaking all these words, the earth was
       32 rent under them ; and the earth opened ; and it swallowed up
            them, and their households, and all the men who were with
       33 Kore, and all their cattle.                   And they, and all that belonged to
             them, went down alive to the mansions of the dead, and the
       34 earth covered them.                    And they were destroyed from among
             the congregation.             And all the Israelites who were around them
             fled at their cry ; for they said, Perhaps the earth may swallow
       35 us up.          And there went forth a fire from the Lord, and con-
             sumed the two hundred and fifty men, who were offering in-
             cense !
                                                                 â€”
      Ch. XVII.                NUMBERS.
      36    Then the Lord said to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest,
         the son of Aaron, Gather up the brasen censers from among
      37 them who were burned ; but as for the strange fire, scatter it
      38 there  Because they have hallowed the censers of these sinful
         men with their lives, therefore make them up into thin plates,
         as a cover for the altar.Because they were presented before
         the Lord, therefore they are hallowed, and made a sign for the
      39 children of Israel.So Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
         took the brasen censers which they who were burned up had
      40 presented ; and of them made a cover for the altar, a memorial
         to the children of Israel, that none of another family, who is not
         of the seed of Aaron, should come near to present incense be-
         fore the Lord, lest he be like Kore, and his confederacy, as the
         Lord spoke to him by the ministry of Moses.
      41    On the next day, when the people murmured against Mo-
      42 ses and Aaron, saying, You have slain the people of the Lord
         when, in their insurrection against Moses and Aaron, the con-
         gregation were rushing upon the tabernacle of the testimony,
      43 the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared : And
         Moses went in, with Aaron, in front of the tabernacle of the
      44 testimony, and the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
      45 Withdraw from among this congregation, and I will destroy
      46 them all at once.Whereupon they fell on their face.And Mo-
         ses said to Aaron, Take the censer, and put therein fire from
         the altar, and throw incense on it, and carry it with all haste to
         the camp, and make atonement for them ; for wrath is gone
         forth from the presence of the Lord, and hath begun to slay
      47 the people.  So Aaron took as Moses commanded him, and
         ran into the congregation; (Now the destruction among the
         people had already begun) and he threw on the incense, and
      48 made atonement for the people, and stood between the dead
      49 and the living ; and the plague ceased.Now they who died by
         the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides
         those who died on the account of Kore.
      50    When Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the taber-
      XVII.     nacle of the testimony, and the plague had ceased, the
       2 Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the children of Israel,
         and take of them a staffâ€”a staff for every huuse of patriarchal
         familiesâ€”from all the chiefs of the respective houses of patri-
     Ch. XVIII.                   NUMBERS.
      3 archal families twelve staves ; and write every one's name on
         his staff; and on the staff of Levi write Aaron's name; for he
         is one staff.The chief of the house of the head family in every
      1 tribe shall give ; and thou shalt lay them in the tabernacle of
      5 the testimony, over against the testimony.    By these I will there
         make myself known to thee ; and it shall come to pass, that the
         staff of the man whom I will chuse, shall bloom : and I will re-
        move from me this murmuring of the children of Israel, which
      6 they murmur against you.      So Moses spoke to the children of
        Israel, and all the chiefs gave him, every one a staffâ€”for every
         chief a staff, according to the houses of their patriarchal fami-
      7 lies, twelve staves, with Aaron's staff among theirs.    And Mo-
        ses laid the staves before the Lord in the tabernacle of the tes-
      8 timony.    And on the next day when Moses went in, with Aaron,
         into the tabernacle of the testimony, behold Aaron's staff, for
        the house of Levi, had bloomed, and brought forth a bud, and
      9 had shot forth blossoms, and produced almonds.         And Moses
         brought out all the staves from the presence of the Lord, be-
        fore all the children of Israel.    And when they saw and had
     10 taken, every one his staff, the Lord said to Moses, Lay up
        Aaron's staff again before the testimonies, to be kept as a sign
         for the children of these rebellious men ; and let their murmur-
     11 ing cease from me that they may not die.      So Moses and Aaron
     12 did as the Lord commanded Moses.        And when they had done
        so, the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we have
        been wasted, we have been destroyed, we have been cut off
     13 suddenly ; every one who toucheth the tabernacle of the Lord
     XVIII.      dieth.   Must we all die ? whereupon the Lord spoke to
         Aaron, saying, Thou, and thy sons, and the house of thy father,
      2 shall bear the sins of the holy things ; and thou, and thy sons,
        shall bear the sins of your priesthood ; take therefore to thyself
         thy brethren, the tribe of Levi, the community of thy father, and
         let them be joined to thee, and perform holy service for thee.
      3 While thou, and thy sons with thee, are before the tabernacle
         of the testimony, they shall keep guard for thee, and guard the
         tabernacle of the testimony : but let them not approach to the
         holy utensils, nor to the altar, lest they die, and you with them.
      4 They shall be joined with thee, and shall keep guard over the
         tabernacle of the testimony, according to all the holy services
         Oh. XVIII.                         NUMBERS.
             of the tabernacle, and none of another family shall come to thee.
          .5 And you shall keep the charge of the holy things, and of the
             altar, so that there shall not be wrath among the children of 1s-
          6 rael.    I have indeed taken your brethren, the Levites, from
             among the children of Israel, as a gift presented to the Lord to
          7 perform the services of the tabernacle of the testimony ; there-
             fore thou, and thy sons with thee, shall keep your priesthood,
             as far as the altar is concerned, and what is within the veil ; and
             you shall perform these services as a privilege of your priest-
             hood ; and any one of another family who approacheth shall be
             put to death.
          8       Moreover the Lord said to Aaron, Behold I have given
             you the charge of the separated portions taken from all the
             dedications made to me by the children of Israel.                    To thee I
          9 have given them for a reward ; and to thy sons after thee. Let this
             therefore be your perpetual due from the hallowed dedications
             of the homage offeringsâ€”from all their gifts, and from all their
             sacrifices, and from all their trespass offerings, and from all their
             sin offerings.     Whatever they give me, a portion of the hallow-
         10 ed things shall be for thee and thy sons.               In the holy place of
             the holies you shall eat them.           Every male, namely, thou and
         11 thy sons shall eat them.          They shall be hallowed to thee.            You
             shall have also a portion from the dedications which the Is-
             raelites make by setting apart, and from all the dedications
             made by being laid on handsâ€”These I have given to thee, and
             thy sons, and thy daughters with thee, as an everlasting due.
         12 Every one in thy house, who is clean, may eat these.                      Every
             dedication of oil, and every dedication of wine, every dedica-
             tion of food of all kinds which they give to the Lord, these I
         13 have given to thee.        All the first fruits in their land, which they
             bring for the Lord, shall belong to thee.                Every one in thy
         14 house, who is clean, may eat these.              Every thing which is de-
         15 voted by the children of Israel shall belong to thee.                And every
             firstling of all flesh, which they bring for the Lord, whether of
             man or beast, shall belong to thee : but the first born of man
             shall be redeemed, and thou shalt cause them to redeem the
         16 firstlings of all cattle which are not clean.           Now the redemption
             of the former, at a month old, shall be the set price of five she-

        lings of kine, and the firstlings of sheep, and the firstlings of
        goats, thou shalt not suffer them to redeem.They are hallow-
       ed ; therefore thou shalt pour out their blood before the altar,
        and offer their suet as an offering of homage, for a smell of fra-
     18 grance for the Lord. And the flesh shall be for thee.Like the
        dedicated breast, and like the right shoulder, it shall be thine.
     19 Every dedication of holy things, which the children of Israel
        set apart for the Lord, I have given to thee, and thy sons, and
        thy daughters, as an everlasting due.It is a covenant of salt
        for ever, before the Lord, with thee and thy seed after thee.
    20      Moreover the Lord said to Aaron, Thou shalt have no in-
       heritance in their land, nor shalt thou have a portion among
        them ; for I am thy portion, and thy inheritance, among the
    21 children of Israel. Andbehold I have given the Levites all the
    22 tenth in Israel, as a portion for their services.Inasmuch as they
        are to perform service at the tabernacle of the testimony, and
        the children of Israel are no more to come to the tabernacle of
     23 the testimony, to bear a sin which incurreth death, but the Le-
        vites themselves are to perform the service of the tabernacle,
        and to bear their sins, this shall be a perpetual due for their ge-
        nerations, and they shall have no inheritance among the chil-
     24 dren of Israel.Because I have given the Levites for their por-
        tion the tithes of the children of Israel, which they set apart
        for the Lord, as a dedication, therefore I have said to them, they
        shall have no lot of inheritance among the Israelites.
     25     Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Thou shalt speak
        to the Levites and say to them ; When you take from the chil-
     26 dren of Israel the tenth which I have given you from them for
     27 a lot of inheritance, you shall set apart from it, as a dedication
        for the Lord, a tenth of the tenth ; and these dedications of
        yours shall be reckoned to you as corn from the threshiDg
     28 floor, and as a dedication from the press.Thus you shall ac-
        quit yourselves of all the dedications of the Lordâ€”of all your
     29 tenths which you receive from the children of Israel.And you
        shall give the dedication set apart from it for the Lord to Aa-
        ron the priest.From all your gifts you shall set apart a dedi-
        cation for the Lord, and from all the lirst fruits, the hallowed
     30 part of it. Moreover thou shalt say unto them, When you set
        apart the first fruits of it, then it shall be reckoned to the Le-

          vites as produce from the threshing floor, and as produce from
      31 the press.   And you may eat it every where, you and your
          households.  Because it is your wages for your services which
      32 you perform at the tabernacle of the testimony ; therefore you
          shall not bear sin by reason of it, because you have set apart
          the first fruits of it.But you must not profane the holy things
          of the children of Israel, lest you die.
       XIX.       Again the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
          This is the purification of the law in respect to all the things
        2 which the Lord hath enjoined, saying, Speak to the children
          of Israel, and let them bring thee a red heifer, without ble-
          mish, which hath no spot in her, and on which there hath
        3 never been put a yoke.   And thou shalt give her to Eleazar the
          priest ; and they shall lead her out of the camp, to a clean
        4 place, and kill her in his presence.    And Eleazar shall take
          some of the blood thereof, and shall sprinkle, over against the
          front of the tabernacle of the testimony, some of the blood
        5 thereof seven times.   Then they shall burn her in his sight;
        6 and when her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, and dung,
          are burned, the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and
          scarlet yarn, and throw them into the midst of the cinders of
        7 the heifer.   Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and wash
          his whole body with water, and, after that, he shall come into
        8 the camp.   And the priest shall be unclean until the evening.
           And he who burned her shall wash his clothes, and wash his
        9 body with water, and be unclean until evening.       And a man
           who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay
           them without the camp, in a clean place, and water of sprink-
           ling shall be kept in store for the congregation of Israel. It is
       10 a purification.  And he who gathereth up the ashes of the
           heifer, shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even-
       11 ing.   And it shall be for the children of Israel, and for the pro-
           selytes who have joined them, an everlasting ordinance, that
           whoever toucheth the dead body of a man shall be unclean
       12 seven days.   He shall be purified on the third, and on the se-
           venth day, then he shall be clean : but if he be not purified on
       13 the third, and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean.  If any
          person, who hath touched the dead, die, without being puri-
           fied, he hath defiled the tabernacle of the Lord ; that soul shall

                be blotted out from among Israel.                                  Because the water of sprink-

                rity is still in him.                  This also is the law, that if any man die in
                a house, every one who goeth into the house, and all the things
          15 in the house, shall be unclean seven days.                                           And every open ves-
          16 sel which hath not a cover fastened on it, is unclean.                                                             And
                every one who, in the open field, toucheth one slain, or dead,
          17 or a human bone, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
                         Now, for one who is unclean, they shall take some of the
          18 burnt ashes of the purification, and pour spring water thereon,
                in a vessel ;             and a man who is clean shall take hyssop, and
                dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the house, and on the
                vessels, and on the persons who may be in the house, and
                on him who hath touched a human bone, or a man who
          19 hath been slain, or one dead, or a grave.                                                The clean person
                shall sprinkle it on the unclean, on the third day, and on the
                seventh day.                And on the seventh day he shall purify himself^
                and shall wash his clothes, and wash himself with water, and

                not purified, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation, be-

                water of sprinkling hath not been sprinkled on him, he is un-

          XX.              When the children of Israel, the whole congregation, came
                to the wilderness of Sin, in the first month, the people took up
                their abode at Kades ; and there Mariam died, and there she
            2 was buried.                 And there being no water for the cougregation,
            3 they assembled tumultuously against Moses and Aaron ; and
                the people reviled Moses, and said,                                    !   that we had died in the
            4 destruction of our brethren before the Lord !                                                 Why have you
                brought the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, to
            5 kill us and our cattle ?                           Why is this ?                 Have you brought us
                 out of Egypt, that we might come to this vile placeâ€”a place
                 where no seed can be sown, where there are no fig trees, nor

       6 vines, nor pomegranates, nor even water to drink?    Where-
         upon Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the congre-
         gation, to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and fell
         on their faces. And the glory of the Lord appeared to them.
       7 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Take thy staff, and as-
       8 semble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother; and
         speak to that rock before them, and it will give its water.And
         you shall bring water for them from that rock, and give drink
       9 to the congregation, and their cattle.So Moses took the staff
      10 which was before the Lord, as the Lord commanded.  And Mo-
         ses and Aaron assembled the congregation, at some distance
         over against the rock, and he said to them, Hear me, ye rebels !
      11 Can we bring water for you out of this rock?     Then Moses
         lifted up his hand, and smote the rock twice with the staff,
         and there gushed out much water, so that the congregation,
      12 and their cattle, drank. Then the Lord said to Moses and
         Aaron, Because you have not believed, to sanctify me before
         the children of Israel, therefore you shall not lead this congre-
      13 gation into the land which I have given them.This is the water
         of Strife, because the children of Israel uttered reproaches be-
         fore the Lord, and he was hallowed among them.
      14     Then Moses sent messengers from Kades, to the king of
         Edom, saying, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest
      15 all the trouble that hath befallen us.Our fathers went down in-
      16 to Egypt, and we have sojourned in Egypt many years.    And
         when the Egyptians ill treated us and our fathers, we cried to
         the Lord, and the Lord hearkened to our voice ; and having
         sent a messenger he hath brought us out of Egypt, and we are
      17 now at Kades, a city on the extremity of thy borders. Let us
         pass through thy land.  We will not march through the fields,
         nor vineyards, nor drink water out of thy cisterns. We will
         march along the king's high way, and will not turn aside to
         the right, nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
      18 But Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass through me.     If
      19 thou attempt it, I will come out to meet thee in battle.Where-
         upon the children of Israel said, Let us pass through along
         the mountains, and if I, or my cattle drink of thy water, I will
         make thee compensation.    Grant but this.  It is but a small
      20 matter.  Let us march through along the mountain.    But he
                                  NUMBERS.
      Ch. XXI
         said, Thou shalt not pass through me.        And Edom came out
      21 to meet him with a great multitude, and a strong hand.            As
         Edom would not grant Israel a passage through his borders,
      22 therefore they turned aside from him ; and having removed
         from Kades, the Israelitesâ€”the whole congregation came to
         mount Hor.
      2.1     And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron at mount Hor,
         on the borders of the land of Edom, saying, Let Aaron be
      24 gathered to his people.    For you shall not enter the land which
         I have given the children of Israel for a possession, because
      25 you provoked me at the water of strife.            Take Aaron thy
         brother, and Eleazar his son, and make them go up to mount
      26 Hor, in the view of the whole congregation, and strip Aaron of
         his robes, and put them on Eleazar his son : and let Aaron be
      27 composed, and die there.       So Moses did as the Lord com-
         manded him.â€”And having taken them up to mount Hor, in
      28 the view of the whole congregation, he stripped Aaron of his
         garments, and put them on Eleazar his son.          And Aaron died
         on the top of the mount.      And Moses and Eleazar came down
      29 from the mount. And when all the congregation saw that Aaron
         was dead, the whole house of Israel mourned for Aaron thirty
         days.
      XXL         When the Chananite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in
         front of the wilderness, heard that Israel was coming by the
       2 way of Atharim, he made war on Israel, and took some of
          them prisoners; whereupon Israel vowed a vow to the Lord,
          and said, If thou wilt deliver this people into my hand, I will
       3 devote them and their cities to destruction.         And the Lord
         hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up these Cha-
         nanites into their hands, and they anathematised them and their
          cities, and called the name of that place Anathema.
       4       Xow when they had removed from mount Hor, by the
          way to the Red sea, and were marching round the land of
          Edom, the people became dispirited in the march, and spoke
       5 against   God, and against Moses, saying, Why hast thou
          brought us out of Egypt to kill us in this wilderness ; for
          we have neither bread, nor water, and our soul loatheth this
       6 light food.    Whereupon the Lord sent the most deadly ser-
       7 pents among the people, and they bit the people.                 And
                                                                                    ;
          Ch. XXI.                                 NUMBERS.
                when many of the children of Israel died, the people came to
               Moses and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken
                against the Lord, and against thee ; pray therefore to the Lord?
            8 and let him take away the serpents from us.                                 So Moses prayed
               to the Lord for the people, and the Lord said to Moses, Make
               thee a serpent, and put it on a standard ; and it shall come to
               pass that when a serpent biteth a man, every one who is bit-
            9 ten shall live by looking at that.                        So Moses made a serpent of
               brass, and put it on a standard, and it came to pass that when
               a serpent bit a man, he looked up to that serpent, and lived.
          10           And the Israelites removed, and encamped at Oboth ; and
          11 having removed from Oboth, they encamped at Achelgai, on
               the borders of the desart, which is in front of Moab, towards
          12 the rising of the sun.                  And removing from that place, they en-
               camped in the vale of Zared, from which they removed, and
          13 encamped on the banks of Arnon, in the wilderness, on the
               borders of the Amorites ; for Arnon is the boundary of Moab,
          14 between Moab and the Amorites.                            For this cause it is said in a
               book,
                   The war of the Lord burned Zoob and the vales of Arnon,
          15       And made the vales the habitation of Er
                   And he adjoineth the borders of Moab.
          16 Thence they came to Well; this is the well concerning which
               the Lord said to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will
          17 give them water to drink.                       Then sung Israel this song to the
               well,
                        Begin to him the alternate song of the well.
          18             Chiefs digged it : the kings of nations hewed it out,
                        In their reign when they ruled over them.
          19 And from Well they moved on to Manthanaiem; and from
          20 Manthanaeim to Naaliel ; and from Naaliel to Bamoth ; and
               from Bamoth to Nepe, which is in that plain of Moab border-
               ing on the craggy cliff, namely, that which looketh towards the
               wilderness.
          21           Now Moses had sent messengers to Seon, king of the
          22 Amorites, with a message of peace, saying, Let us pass through
                thy land.        We will march by the highway; we will not turn
                aside into the fields, nor into the vineyards ; nor will we drink
                water out of thy;wells.               Let us march along the king's highway.

     23 until we pass thy borders.   But Seon would not grant Israel
        a passage through his territories. He indeed assembled all his
        people, and went out to the wilderness, to attack Israel, and
     24 came to Jessa, and drew up in array against Israel.     Where-
        upon Israel smote him with the slaughter of the sword, and
        took possession of his land, from Anion to Jabok, even to the
     25 Ammanites ; for Jazer is the boundary of the Ammanites.      So
        Israel took all those cities ; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of
        the Amorites, in Hesebon, and in all those under the same do-
     26 minion with it ; for Hesebon was the city of Seon the king of
        the Amorites.   He indeed had made war on a former king of
        Moab, and had taken all his land from Aroer to Arnon ; for
        this cause the poets say,
     27        Come to Hesebon that it may be rebuilded,
               And that the city of Seon may be inhabited.
     28        For a fire went forth from Hesebon
               And a flame from the city of Seon
               Which devoured even to Moab
               Which devoured the pillars of Arnon.
     29           Alas ! for thee  Moab !
               Thou wast undone,     people of Chamos !
               Their sons were delivered up to save their lives ;
               And their daughters were captives to Seon, king of the
                  Amorites,
     30        And their seed was destroyed from Hesebon even to
                  Daibon.
               And against Moab their wives rekindled a fire.
     31      Andwhen Israel had taken possession of all the cities of the
     32 Amorites : Moses sent to view Jazer, and they took it, and all
     33 the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites who were
        there.  Then they turned and went up by the way of Basan.
         And when Og king of Basan came out to meet them, he and
         all his people, for battle at Adrairn, the Lord said to Moses,
     34 Be not afraid of him ; for into thy hands I will deliver him, and
         all his people, and all his land ; And thou shalt do to him, as
         thou hast done to Seon, the king of the Amorites, who dwelt
     35 at Hesebon.   So he smote him, and his sons,, and all his people,
        until there was not one left to be taken alive.  And they took
         possession of their land.

       XXII.       When the Israelites had removed, and pitched their
          tents on the west of Moab, along the Jordan, over against Je-
        2 richo ; and Balak, son of Sepphor, had seen all that Israel had
        3 done to the Arnorites, though Moab was exceedingly afraid
          of the people because they were numerous, yet Moab was in-
          censed at the sight of the Israelites, and said to the Senate of
        4 Madiam, Now will this congregation lick up all around us, as
        5 the ox licketh up the grass of the field.      Now Balak, son of
          Sepphor, was at that time king of Moab, he therefore had sent
          messengers to Balaam, son of Beor, at Pathoura, which is by
          the river of the land of the children of his people, to invite him
          to come to him, saying, Behold there is a people come out of
          Egypt; and lo ! they have covered the face of this land, and are
        6 settled down near me.     Now therefore come, curse for me this
          people ; for they are stronger than I.   Perhaps I may be able to
          smite some of them, and drive them out of this land : for I know
          that they whom thou blessest are blessed, audi they whom thou
        7 cursest are cursed.    So the ambassadors of Moab, and the am-
          bassadors of Madiam, went with the rewards of divination in their
        8 hands, and when they came to Balaam, and rehearsed to him the
          words of Balak, he said to them, Tarry here this night, and I will
        9 give you an answer according to what the Lord shall say to me.
          So the chiefs of Moab tarried with Balaam. And God came to Ba-
       ll) laam, and said to him, What would these men with thee ?       And
           Balaam said to God, Balak son of Sepphor, king of Moab, hath
       11 sent them to me, sayiug, Behold there is a people come out of
           Egypt, who have covered the face of this land, and they are
          settled down near me ; now therefore come and curse them for
           me; perhaps I may be able to smite them, and drive them out
       12 of this land.   Thereupon God said to Balaam, Thou shalt not
       13 go with them, nor curse that people, for they are blessed.       So
           when Balaam arose in the morning, he said to the chiefs of Ba-
           lak, Return speedily to your Lord, for God doth not permit
       14 me to go with you.      And the chiefs of Moab arose, and went
           to Balak, and said to him, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
       15 Then Balak sent again other princes, more in number, and of
       16 greater dignity than them, and they went to Balaam and said to
           him, Thus saith Balak, the son of Sepphor, I entreat thee delay
       17 not to come to me, for I will promote thee to great honour,

                 and do for thee whatever thou sayest ; therefore come, curse
         18 this people for me.                                  In reply to which Balaam said to the prin-
                 ces of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver
                 and gold, I cannot transgress the word of the Lord God, to do
         19 any thing, small or great, of my own mere will.                                                                           Now therefore
                 tarry you also here this night, that I may know what the Lord
         20 will further say to me.                                          And God came to Balaam by night,
                 and said to him, If these men come to call thee, arise and go
         21 with them : but what I say to thee, that thou shalt do.                                                                                   Where-
                 upon Balaam arose in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
         22 went with the princes of Moab.                                                        Aad God was angry, because
                  he went of himself to him ; and the angel of God arose to stop
                  him on the way.                            Now he was mounted on his ass, and had two
         23 servants with him.                                      And when the ass saw the angel of God
                  standing opposite, in the way, with a drawn sword in his hand,
                  the ass turned aside out of the way into the field ; at which he
          24 struck the ass with his staff, to turn her into the road.                                                                                      Then
                  the angel of God took a station between the rows of the vines,
          25 there being a hedge on this side, and a hedge on that.                                                                                            And
                  when the ass saw the angel of God, she threw herself against
                  the wall, and bruised Balaam's foot against the wall.                                                                                Where-
          26 upon he struck her again.                                              Then the angel of God again retir-
                  ed, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no turning,
          27 to the right, or to the left.                                             And when the ass saw the angel of
                  God, she lay down under Balaam ; at which Balaam was in-
                 > flamed with wrath, and gave the ass a severe blow with the
           28 staff.                Thereupon God opened the mouth of the ass, and she
                  said to Balaam, What have I done to thee that thou hast cor-
           29 rectecl me this third time ? And Balaam said to the ass, because
                   thou hast mocked me, and had I a sword in my hand I should
           30 now have run it through thee.                                                        And the ass said to Balaam,
                   Am I not the ass on which thou hast ridden from thy youth
                  even to this day ?                             Did I ever through stubbornness, do such a
            31 thing as this to thee.                                    And he said, No.                             Then God opened the
                   eyes of Balaam ; and when he saw the angel of the Lord stand-
                   ing opposite, in the way, with a drawn sword in his hand, he
            32 bowed down, and fell flat on his face.                                                              And the angel of God
                   said to him, Why didst thou strike thy ass three times? Be-
                   hold I came out to stop thee, because thy journey is not seemly

       33 in ray sight, and the ass, seeing me, turned aside from me these
          three times. And had she not turned aside from me I should
          now have killed thee ; but I would have preserved her alive.
       34 Then Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, I have sinned in-
          advertently ; for I did not know that thou stoodest in the way
          against me.  Now therefore, if it is not agreeable to thee, I will
       35 turn back.  And the angel of God said to Balaam, Go with
          these men ; but whatever word I speak to thee be careful to
       36 deliver that. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.  And
          when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to
          meet him, to a city of Moab, which is on Arnon, which is a
       37 part of the boundary.  And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not
          send for thee ? Why then didst thou not come to me ? Am not
       38 I able to promote thee to honour ?And Balaam said to Balak,
          Behold nowI am come to thee, shall I be able to say any thing ?
          Whatever word God shall put in my mouth, that I will speak.
       39 So Balaam went with Balak, and when they came to the cities
      40 of Sheepcots, Balak sacrificed sheep, and young bulls, and
      41 sent them to Balaam, and the princes with him.  And early next
          morning Balak took Balaam, and led him up to the top of the
          pillar of Baal, and from it shewed him some part of the peo-
       XXIII.     pie.  Whereupon Balaam said to Balak, Build for me
          here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven young bulls,
        2 and seven rams.   And when Balak had done as Balaam had
          ordered him ; and had offered a bull, and a ram, on each altar,
          then Balaam said to Balak, Stand by thy sacrifice, and I will
        3 advance on.  If God appear to me by any occurrence, whatever
          he shall shew me I will tell thee.So Balak stood by his sacri-
        4 fice. And Balaam went to inquire of God : and as he was going
          straight forward, God appeared to Balaam : And Balaam said
          to him, I have prepared seven altars, and offered a young bull,
        5 and a ram, on each altar. And God put a word in the mouth
          of Balaam, and said, Return to Balak, and thus thou shalt say.
        6 So he returned to Balak.   Now he was standing by his whole
        7 burnt offerings, and all the princes of Moab with him ; And a
          spirit of God came upon Balaam, and he took up his parable,
          and said,
              I am called from Mesopotamia by Balak
              By the king of Moab from the mountains of the east,
                                                                                           ;      !                   !   !

           8              How can I curse hiin, whom the Lord doth nut curse ?
                      Or how devote him whom God devoteth not ?
           9              For from the top of mountains I can see him ;
                      Even from hills I can observe him,
                      Behold he shall dwell, as a people by themselves,
                      And shall not be reckoned among the nations.
         10               Who hath accurately scanned the seed of Jacob?
                      Who can count the communities of Israel ?
                      May my soul depart among the souls of the righteous
                      And my offspring be as the seed of these
         11           At this Balak said to Balaam, What hast thou done to me ?
         12 I sent for thee to curse my enemies, and behold thou hast pro-
               nounced a blessing.                       And Balaam said to Balak, Must I not
         13 be careful to speak what God hath put in my mouth ?                                                              Then
               Balak said to him, Come with me to yet another place, from
               which thou shalt not have a full view of them.                                               Thou shalt see
               only a part of them, and not view them all ; and curse them for
         14 me from that place.                        So he took him to a watch tower of the field
               on the top of a craggy cliff, and built there seven altars.                                                     xVnd
         15 when he had offered a bull, and a ram, on each altar, Balaam said
               to Balak, Stand by thy sacrifice, and I will advance on, to in-
         16 quire of God.                     And God met Balaam and put a word in his
               mouth, and said, Keturn to Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
         17 So he returned to him.                               Now he was standing by his whole
               burnt offering, and all the princes of Moab with him.                                                           And
               Balak said to him, What hath the Lord spoken ?                                                    Whereupon
               he took up his parable, and said,

                     Listen attentively as a witness, thou son of Sepphor
         19          God is not like a man to be deceived
                     Nor like a son of man to be threatened.
                     When he hath spoken, will he not perform ?
                     When he shall speak, will he not stand to it ?
        20                Behold I am constrained to bless !
                     Bless I will.              Indeed I cannot avoid it.
        21           There shall be no calamity in Jacob ;
                     Nor shall misery be seen in Israel.

                           Is to them like the glory of a unicorn.
            23             For there is no augury used by Jacob
                           Nor divination among Israel.
                           In due season it shall be told by Jacob,
                           And to Israel, what God will execute.
            24             Behold the people will rouse like a young lion
                           And, like an old lion, exult with pride.
                           They will not go to rest till they devour prey
                           Until they have drunk the blood of the slain.
            25             Upon this Balak said to Balaam, Thou shalt neither with
                    curses, curse them for me; nor shalt thou with blessings bless
            26 them.                In reply to which Balaam said to Balak, Did I not tell
            27 thee saying, Whatever God shall speak, that I must do.                                                                          Then
                    Balak said to Balaam, Come let me take thee to another place,
                    that, if it please God, thou mayst curse them for me from it.
            28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Phogor, which extendeth
            29 into the wilderness.                              And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here
                    seven altars, and prepare for me here seven young bulls, and
             30 seven rams.                        And when Balak had done as Balaam ordered
            XXIV.                  him, and had offered a bull, and a ram, on every altar,
                    Balaam, seeing that it was good in the sight of the Lord to
                    bless Israel, did not go, as was customary with him, to look
               2 for omens ; but turned his face towards the wilderness.                                                                         And
                    when Balaam raised his eyes, and saw Israel encamped by
                    tribes, a spirit of God came upon him, and he took up his para-

               clapped his hands.                     And Balak said to Balaam, I sent for thee

         24         For bands of Kitians will issue forth,
                    And afflict Assur, and afflict Hebrews :
                    And they themselves shall likewise be destroyed.
         2.3 Then Balaam arose, and went away, with a view to return to
               his own place, and Balak repaired home.
         XXY.           While Israel abode at Sattin, the people profaned theni-
           2 selves to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab, who
               invited them to the sacrifices of their idols ; and the people ate
               of their sacrifices, and worshipped their idols, and Israel con-
           3 secrated himself to Belphegor.                         Whereupon the wrath of the
               Lord was kindled against Israel ; and the Lord said to Moses,
           4 Take all those leaders of the people and make a public ex-
               ample of them, for the Lord, in the face of the sun ; so shall
            5 the wrath of the Lord be turned away from Israel.                                     Then Mo-
               ses said to the tribes of Israel, Kill ye, every one, him of his
            6 family, who hath consecrated himself to Belphegor.                                      And be-
               hold there came a man of the children of Israel, who conduct-
               ed his brother to a Madianitish woman in the sight of Moses,
               and before all the congregation of the sons of Israel, while
               they were weeping at the door of the tabernacle of the testi-
            7 mony.          Upon seeing this, Phineas, son of Eleazar, son of
               Aaron the priest, started up from among the congregation, and
            8 taking a javelin in his hand, went after the manâ€”the Israelite,
      Ch. XXVI.                     NUMBERS.
          into the bed chamber, and ran them both through, the man, the
       9 Israelite, quite through, and the woman into her belly.        Where-
          upon the plague stopped from the children of Israel.        Now they
      10 who had died of the plague were twenty four thousand.              And
      11 the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Phineas, son of Eleazar, son
          of Aaron the priest, hath stayed my wrath from Israel, by shew-
          ing a zeal for me among them, so that in my jealousy I have
          not utterly consumed the children of Israel.           Therefore say,
      12 Behold I give him the covenant of peace.           It shall be to him,
      13 and to his seed after him, an everlasting covenant of the
          priests' office, because he shewed a zeal for his God, and made
      14 atonement for the children of Israel.         Now the name of the
          manâ€”the Israelite, who was slain with the Madianitish wo-
          man, was Zambri, son of Salmon, the chief of the patriarchal
      15 house of of the Symeonites ; and the name of the Madianitish
          woman, who was slain, was Chasbi, a daughter of Sour, the
          chief of the clan of Ommath, which is the head family of Ma-
          diam.
      lb'     Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the
      17 children of Israel, and say, Treat as enemies the Madianites,
          and smite them, for they are acting as enemies against you,
          with craftiness, in all their attempts to beguile you by means
          of Phogor, and by means of Chasbi, the daughter of a prince
          of Madiam, their sister, who was slain on the day of the
          plague, on account of Phogor.
      XXVI.        And, after the plague, the Lord spoke to Moses, and
       2 Eleazar the priest, saying, Take the sum of the whole congre-
          gation of Israel, from twenty years old and upwards, according
          to the houses of their families, every one who goeth out to war
       3 in Israel.    Upon which, orders were issued by Moses, and
          Eleazar   the   priest, at   Araboth-Moab, on the Jordan over
       4 against Jericho, saying, From twenty years old and iirpwards,
          as the Lord commanded Moses.
              Now these were the sons of Israel who came out of Egypt.
       5        Reuben, Israel's first born.       xVnd the sons of Reuben,

                 muster of them was forty three thousand seven hundred and
             8 thirty.          Xow of the Phalluites, Eliab was chief, and the sons of
              9 Eliab were Xamuel ; and Dathan, and Abiron.                                                These were
                 the head families of the congregation.                                  These were they who
                 conspired against Moses and Aaron, in the company of Kore,
            10 in the insurrection against the Lord.                                 And the earth, opening
                 its mouth, swallowed them up with Kore, at the time when his
                 company diedâ€”when the fire consumed the two hundred and
           11 fifty, and they were made a sign; but the children of Kore
                 died not.
            12         And the children of Symeon were, the community of the

             a son of Machir, from Galaad, the community of the Galaad-

       42     And the children of Dan, according to their communities,

       51     This muster of the Israelites was six hundred and one thou-
          sand and seven hundred and thirty.
       52     And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Among these let
       53 the land be divided, that they may inherit it, by the number of
       54 names.    To those who are many, thou shalt enlarge the inhe-
          ritance ; and to them who are few, thou shalt give the less in-
          heritance.   To every one, as they have been reviewed, their in-
          heritance shall be given.    Among these names the land shall
       55 be parcelled out, by lot.    They shall inherit according to the
       56 tribes of their patriarchal families.By lot thou shalt parcel out
           their inheritance, to the many and the few.
       57     Now these were the children of Levi, according to their
           communitiesâ€”of Gerson, the community of the Gersonites
           of Kaath, the community of the Kaathites ; of Merari, the com-
       58 munity of the Merarites.     These are also communities of the
           children of Leviâ€”the community of the Lobenites, the com-
           munity of the Chebronites, the community of the Korites, the
       59 community of the Musites.      And Kaath begot Ambram, whose
           wife's name was Jochabed, a daughter of Levi and she bore
           these for Levi in Egyptâ€”She bore by Ambram, Aaron, and
       60 Moses, and Mariam their sister.    And to Aaron were born Na-
       61 dab and Abiud, and Eleazar and Ithamar.          But Nadab and
           Abiud died when they presented strange fire before the Lord,

     62 in the wilderness of Sina.From the review of them, they were
        twenty three thousand, including every male, from a month old
        and upwards ; for they were not reviewed among the children
        of Israel ; because there was no portion given them among the
     63 children of Israel.Now this was the review of Moses and Ele-
        azar the priest, who reviewed the Israelites at Arabeth-Moab,
     64 on the Jordan, over against Jericho ; and among them there was
        not a man of those who had been reviewed by Moses and Aaron,
        when they reviewed the Israelites in the wilderness of Sina.
     65 Because the Lord said to them, they shall assuredly die in the
        wilderness ; therefore there was not one of them left, save Cha-
        leb son of Jephonne, and Joshua son of Nave.
     XXVII.      Then came the daughters of Salpaad, son of Opher,
        son of Galaad, son of Machir, of the community of Manasses,
      2 one of the sons of Joseph (now these were their names ; Maala,
        and Nua, and Egla, and Melcha, and Thersa) and standing be-
        fore Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the
        chiefs, and before the whole congregation, at the door of the
      3 tabernacle of the testimony, they said, Our father died in the
        wilderness, but he was not among the congregation which con-
        spired against the Lord, in the assembly of Kore. Because he
      4 died for his own sin, and had no sons, let not the name of our
        father be blotted out from among his community.    Seeing he
        hath not a son, give us a possession among our father's bre-
      5 thren.  Whereupon Moses laid their case before the Lord.
      6 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, The daughters of Sal-
      7 paad have spoken right.   Thou shalt give them the possession
        of an inheritance among their father's brothers, and vest in them
      8 their father's lot.And thou shalt say to the children of Israel,
        If any man die, and hath no son, you shall vest his inheritance
      9 in his daughter ; and if he hath no daughter, you shall give his
     10 inheritance to his brother ; and if he hath no brothers, you shall
     11 give his inheritance to his father's brother ; and if there be no
        brothers of his father, you shall give the inheritance to one of
        his house, who is the nearest of kin to him, of his tribe, that
        he may inherit what belonged to him.  And this shall be to the
        children of Israel a rule of decision, as the Lord commanded
        Moses.
     12     Then the Lord said to Moses, Go up that mountain which
                                                                            â€”-

           is on the bank of the Jordanâ€”that mount Nabo, and take a
           view of the land of Chanaan, which I give to the children of Is-
        13 rael, by a possessory right.   And when thou hast seen it, thou
           shalt be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother was ga-
        14 thered on mount Hor, because you transgressed my command
           in the wilderness of Sin.   When the people resisted the hallow-
           ing of me, you did not hallow me at the water before them.
           (This alludeth to the water of strife at Kades in the widerness.)
        15     Upon this Moses said to the Lord, Let the Lord, the God of
        16 the spirits, and of all flesh, look out a man to be set over this
           congregation, who shall go out before them, and come in before
       17 them ; and who shall lead them out, and bring them in ; so that
           the congregation of the Lord may not be like a flock which
       18 hath no shepherd.       Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
           Take as thy associate Joshua, son of Nave, a man who hath a
           spirit in him, and thou shalt lay thy hands on him, and set him
       19 before Eleazar, the priest, and give him a charge before the
           whole congregation, and give a charge before them concerning
       20 him.    And thou shalt put some of thy glory on him, that the
       21 children of Israel may hearken to him.       And he shall stand be-
           fore Eleazar, the priest, and they shall ask him the determina-
           tion of the manifestations before the Lord.       And at his com-
           mand they shall go out ; and at his command he, and all the
           children of Israel with him, even all the congregation, shall

       22      So Moses did as the Lord commanded him ; and hav-
           ing taken Joshua, he set him before Eleazar the priest, and
           before all the congregation, and laid his hands on him, and made
           him his associate, as the Lord commanded Moses.
       XXVIII.        Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Give a charge
         2 to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, You shall
           observe to bring me my gifts, my oblations, my homage offer
        o ings for a smell of fragrance at my festivals.       Moreover thou
           shalt say to them, These are the homage offerings which you
           shall present to the Lordâ€”two lambs, of the first year, with-
        4 out blemish, every day, for a continual whole burnt offering
           the one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning, and the other in
         5 the evening ; and for a sacrifice of flour, thou shalt offer the
           tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed up with the quarter of

       6 an hin of oil. It is the continual whole burnt offering, which
         was instituted at mount Sina, for a smell of fragrance for the
      7 Lord : and for the libation thereof, thou shalt offer, with the first
         lamb, a quarter of an hin of wine. In the holy place thou shalt
      8 pour out as a libation the choicest wine to the Lord.   And to-
         wards evening thou shalt offer the other lamb, with the like
         sacrifice, and the like libation ; for a smell of fragrance for the
         Lord.
      9     And on the day of the sabbaths, you shall bring two lambs
         of the first year, without blemish, and two tenths of fine flour
         mixed up with oil, for a sacrifice, together with a libation, as
     10 the sabbath whole burnt offering, for every sabbath, over and
        above the continual whole burnt offering with its libation.

        libation shall be, the half of an hin of wine for each bull ; and
        the third of an hin for the ram ; and the fourth of an hin for
        every lamb.   This shall be the whole burnt offering, month af-

           the continual whole burnt offering, thou shalt offer it with its
       25 libation.   And the seventh of these days shall be solemnly set
           apart for you.   On it you shall do no sacrificial work.
       26      And on the day of new things when you bring for the Lord
           the new sacrifice of the weeks, there shall be a solemn festival

       30 atonement for you.     Over and above the continual whole burnt
       31 offering, you shall offer me the sacrifice of these (and see that
           they be without blemish) together with the libations thereof.
       XXIX.        And in the seventh month on the first day of the
           month, there shall be a solemn festival for you.      You shall do
         2 no sacrificial work.   It shall be to you a day of alarm.      And

             hath commanded. If any man vow a vow to the Lord, or swear an
             oath, or bind himself with a solemn promise concerning his soul,
             he shall not break his word.                  Whatever hath proceeded from his
         3 mouth he shall do.                 And if a woman vow to the Lord, or bind
         1 herself with a solemn promise, in her father's house, in her
             youth ; and her father hear her vows, and her promises with
             which she hath bound her soul, and hold his peace at her ; all
            her vows, and all the promises with which she bound her soul,
         5 shall stand.           They shall be binding on her.                      But if her father
            expressly disapprove on the day he heareth her vows and the
            promises, with which she hath bound her soul, they shall not
            stand.       And the Lord will acquit her because her father hath
         6 disallowed her.             And if she be married, and vows be upon her
         7 according to the opening of her lipsâ€”with what promises so-
            ever she may have bound her soul, if her husband shall hear,
            and hold his peace at her on the day when he heareth, so shall
            all her vows stand, and the promises shall stand with which
         8 she hath bound her soul.                     But if her husband expressly disal-
            low her on the day when he shall hear, none of her vows, and
            none of the obligations with which she hath bound her soul,
            shall be binding, because her husband disallowed her.                                        And
         9 the Lord will acquit her.                   But the vows of a widow, or of one
             divorcedâ€”whatever vows she may have made to bind her
       10 soul, shall stand against her.                      And if her vow, or the obliga-
            tion with which she bound her soul with an oath, be made in
       11 her husband's house ; and her husband shall hear, and hold
            his peace at her, and not disallow her ; all her vows and all her
            promises with which she hath bound her soul shall stand
       12 against her.            But if her husband on the day when he heareth,
            actually disannul all that may have proceeded out of her lips,
            of what nature soever her vows may be, or the obligations
            with which she bound her soul, they shall not be binding on
            her.     Her husband hath made them void, and the Lord will
       13 acquit her.           Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict her
       14 soul, her husband may establish, or make void.                                And if lie hold
            his peace at her, day after day, he shall establish upon her all
            her vows, and confirm the obligations upon her, because he held
       15 his peace at her on the day he heard them.                                  And if her hus-

      16     These are the judgments which the Lord gave in charge to
          Moses, between a husband and wife, and between a father
          and a daughter in her youth, in her father's house.
      XXXI.       Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Avenge the
       2 cause of the children of Israel on the Madianites, and after-
       3 ward thou shalt be gathered to thy people.    Whereupon Mo-
          ses spoke to the people, saying, Arm men from among you
          and array them before the Lord, against Madian, to pour ven-
       4 geance from the Lord on Madianâ€”a thousand from every
       5 tribe.  You shall send them out of all the tribes to be drawn
         up in array.  So out of the thousands of Israel they numbered
          a thousand from a tribeâ€”twelve thousand.    They were armed
       6 for close engagement.     And Moses sent theseâ€”a thousand
         from every tribe ; and with the army composed of them, Phi-
         neas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, with the holy in-
         strumentsâ€”the trumpets for sounding a charge, in their hands.
       7 And they drew up in array against Madian, as the Lord com-
       8 manded Moses, and slew every male ; and in the slaughter they
          slew the kings of Madian, Evin, and Rokon, and Sur, and Ur,
       9 and Robok, the five kings of Madian.   They slew also Balaam,
         son of Beor, with the sword among their slain.    And having
          taken for a prey the women of the Madianites, and their furni-
          ture, and their cattle, and all their goods, and spoiled their ar-
      10 my, and burned all their cities in which they dwelt, and all their
      11 sheepcots, with fire, and taken all the prey thereof, and all the
      12 spoils thereof, both of man and beast, they brought to Moses,
          and Eleazar, and to all the Israelites, the captives, and the
          spoils, and the prey, to the camp at Araboth-Moab, on the Jor-
      13 dan, over against Jericho.  And when Moses went out, accom-
          panied with Eleazar the priest, and all the chiefs of the con-
      14 gregation, to meet them without the camp, Moses was an-
      15 gry at the officers of the armyâ€”at the captains of thousands,
          and the captains of hundreds, who came from the war.     And
      16 Moses said to them, Why have you saved all the women alive ?
          For they, by the direction of Balaam, were the cause of Is-
          rael's apostatizing, and transgressing the commands of the
      17 Lord, for the sake of Phogor : and there was a plague in the
      Ch. XXXI.                     NUMBEKS.
         congregation of the Lord.       Now therefore kill every male
         among the captives.     Kill also every woman, who hath lain
      18 with man.    But save alive, for yourselves, every captive among
         the women, who hath not known a man.           And abide without
     19 the camp seven days.       Every one who hath slain, or who hath
         touched one slain, must be purified on the third day, and on
     20 the seventh day, including yourselves and your captives.        And
         you must purify every covering, and every vessel made of
         skin, and every hair cloth, and every utensil of wood.
     21      Then Eleazar the priest, said to the men of the army, who
         came from the war, This is the ordinance of the law, which
     22 the Lord gave in charge to Moses, Besides the gold, and the
         silver, and the brass, and the iron, and the lead, and the tin,
         every thing which can pass through fire must be purified by
     23 fire; but the rest are to be purified by the water of purifica-
         tion only.   Whatever cannot pass through fire must pass
     2-1 through water.   And on the seventh day you must wash your
         clothes, and you shall be clean ; and after that you may come
         into the camp.
     25      Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Take the sum of
     26 the captivated prey both of man and beast ; thou, and Eleazar
         the priest, and the chiefs of the patriarchal houses of the con-
     27 gregation.    And you shall divide the prey between the warriors
     28 who went to battle, and the whole congregation.      And you shall
         set apart as a tribute to the Lord, from the warriors who went
         out to battle, one in five hundred from the captives, and from
         the beasts, namely, the cattle, and the sheep, and the asses.
     29 These you shall take from their half, and give to Eleazar the
     30 priest, as a portion set apart for the Lord.    And from the chil-
         dren of Israel's half thou shalt take one in fifty of the captives,
        and of the cattle, and the sheep, and the assesâ€”of all these
        beasts.   And these thou shalt give to the Levites, who keep
     31 the watch at the tabernacle of the Lord.     So Moses and Eleazar
     32 the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.         And the whole
        amount of the booty which the warriors had taken, was, of
     33 sheep six hundred and seventy five thousand ; of cattle seven-
     34 ty two thousand, and sixty one thousand asses ; and of the
     35 human species, namely, of the women who had not known
     36 man, all the souls were thirty two thousand.      So that the half
        which was the share of those who went to war, was, from the
       Ch. XXXII.                     NUMBEKS.
          number of sheep, three hundred and thirty seven thousand
       37 five hundred ; of which the tribute for the Lord was six hun-
       38 dred and seventy five ; and of cattle, thirty six thousand,
       39 of which the tribute for the Lord was seventy two ; and of asses,
       40 thirty thousand five hundred, of which the tribute for the
          Lord was sixty one ; and the human beings were sixteen
          thousand, of whom the tribute for the Lord was thirty two.
       41 And this tribute for the Lord, this dedication made to God
          by setting it apart, Moses gave to Eleazar the priest as the
      42 Lord commanded Moses.        And from the half belonging to the
          children of Israel, between whom and the warriors Moses had
          made the division ;    now the congregation's half was three
          hundred and thirty seven thousand five hundred sheep, thirty
          six thousand cattle, thirty thousand five hundred asses, and
      47 of    human beings, sixteen thousandâ€”from this half, be-
          longing to the children of Israel, Moses took one in fifty, of
          man and beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept the
          watch at the tabernacle of the testimony, as the Lord com-
          manded Moses.
       48     Then all the officers over the thousands of the army, the
          captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came to
       49 Moses, and said to him, Thy servants have taken an account
          of all the warriors who were with us, and there is not one of
       50 them missing.      We have therefore brought, as every man
          chanced to find a jewel of gold, either a necklace, or a brace-
          let, or a ring, or an ornament for the right arm, or a chain, to
       51 make atonement for us before the Lord.        So Moses and Elea-
          zar the priest, received from them the goldâ€”all the wrought
       52 jewels; and the whole amount of the gold, the dedication
          which they set apart for the Lord, was, sixteen thousand seven
          hundred and fifty shekels.     This they received from the cap-
       53 tains of thousands, and captains of hundreds.        Of the spoil,
          which the warriors made every man for himself, Moses and
          Eleazar the priest received the gold from the captains of thou-
       54 sands, and the captains of hundreds, and brought it into the
          tabernacle of the testimony, to be a memorial of the children
          of Israel before the Lord.
       XXXII.      Now the children of Keuben, and the children of Gad,
          had a great multitude of cattle, and having taken a view of the
      Ch. XXXII.                 NUMBERS.
         country of Jazer, and the region of Galaad, and seen that it
       2 was a place fit for stock, the Reubenites and the Gadites came
         to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the chiefs of the
       3 congregation and said, Ataroth, and Daibon, and Jazer, and
         Namra, and Esebon, and Eleale, and Sebama, and Nabo, and
       4 Baian, the land which the Lord delivered up before the chil-
         dren of Israel, is a land fit for raising stock, and thy servants
       5 have cattle ; if therefore, said they, we have found favour in
         thy sight, let this land be given to thy servants for a posses-
       6 sion, and cause us not to cross the Jordan.      Whereupon Mo-
         ses said to the Gadites and the Reubenites, Must your bre-
       7 thren go to war, and you sit still here ?    Besides, why do you
         divert the thoughts of the Israelites from crossing over into the
       8 land which the Lord giveth them?        Did not your fathers do
         so, when I sent them from Kades-Barne to view the land?
       9 When they had passed through the valley of grapes, and view-
         ed the land, they discouraged the heart of the Israelites from
      10 going to the land which the Lord gave them ; and the anger
      11 of the Lord was kindled that day, and he sware saying, These
         men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and
         upwards, who know good and evil, shall not see the land,
         which I with an oath promised to Abraham, and Isaak, and
      12 Jacob ;  (for they have not followed me) save Chaleb, son of
         Jephonne, who separated himself from them, and Joshua, son
      13 of Nave, because they followed the Lord.      So the anger of the
         Lord was kindled against Israel, and he led them about in the
         wilderness forty years, until all that generation, who had done
      14 evil in the sight of the Lord, was consumed.      Behold you are
         risen up in your fathers' stead, a set of sinful men, to augment
      15 the wrath of the Lord against Israel.   For by turning away from
         him, to cause him to leave you still in the wilderness, you will
         transgress against the whole congregation.
      16     Upon this they came near to him, and said, We will build
         sheepcots here for our cattle, and cities for our families, but
      17 we ourselves, completely armed, will march in the van before
      18 the children of Israel, until we bring them to their place.   Our
         families indeed must dwell in walled cities, because of the in-
         habitants of the land, that we may not be under a necessi-
         ty of returning to our houses, until the children of Israel are
      Ch. XXXII.                NUMBEKS.
      19 parcelled out, every one in his possession.Moreover we will
         not take a share with thern of the land beyond the river Jordan,
         because we have got our share on the eastern side of the Jordan.
      20 Then Moses said to them, If you will act agreeably to what
         you sayâ€”if you will arm yourselves for battle before the Lord,
      21 and every one, completely armed, will cross the Jordan before
         the Lord, until his enemy be crushed before him, and the land
      22 subdued before the Lord, after this you shall return, and be
         guiltless before the Lord, and acquitted by Israel, and this land
      23 shall be your possession before the Lord.But if you do not
        act in this manner, you will sin against the Lord, and you
     24 shall be sensible of your sin, when evils overtake you.Build
         therefore cities for your families, and sheepcots for your cat-
     25 tie, and perform what hath proceeded out of your mouth.And
        the sons of Keuben and the sons of Gad spake to Moses, say-
     26 ing, Thy servants will do as our Lord commandeth ; our fa-
         milies, and our wives, and our cattle, shall remain in the cities
     27 of Galaad ; but we thy servants will cross over, all armed, and ar-
     28 rayed for battle before the Lord, as our lord saith.Then Moses
         convened with them Eleazar the priest, and Joshua, son of Nave,
         and the chiefs of the patriarchal houses of the tribes of Israel,
      29 and said to them, If the Keubenites and the Gadites cross
        the Jordan with you, every one armed for battle before the
        Lord, when you shall have subdued the land before you, you
     30 shall give them the land of Galaad for a possession.But if they
         decline to cross with you, armed for battle before the Lord ;
         you shall drive before you their families, and their wives, and
         their cattle, into the land of Chanaan, and they shall have a
     31 portion with you in the land of Chanaan.And the Keubenites
         and the Gadites answered, saying, All that our lord saith to
     32 his servants we will do.We will cross over, completely arm-
         ed before the Lord, into the land of Chanaan, and you shall
     33 give us our possession on this side of the Jordan.So Moses
         gave them, namely, to the Gadites and the Keubenites, and to
         the half of the tribe of Manasses, one of the sons of Joseph,
         the kingdom of Seon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom
         of Og king of Basan, the land and the cities, with the bounda-
     34 ries thereof, even the cities of the land round about.And the
      35 Gadites rebuilt Daibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, and Sophar,
     Ch. XXXIII.              NUMBERS.
     36 and Jazer, and raised these, namely, Naniraro and Baithara,
     37 fenced cities, and folds for sheep.And the Reubenites rebuilt
        Esebon, and Eleale, and Kariatharn, and Beelmeon, which
     38 they enclosed all around, and Sebama ; and they named the
     39 cities which they rebuilt after their own names.Now a de-
        scendant of Machir, son of Manasses, had gone to Galaad, and
     40 taken it, and destroyed the Amorite who dwelt there.So Mo-
        ses gave Galaad to the community of Machir, son of Manas-
     41 ses, and they dwelt there.And Jair, of the tribe of Manasses,
        went and took their sheepcots, and called them the sheep-
     42 cots of Jair.And Nabau went and took Kaath, and its vil-
        lages, and called them Naboth after his own name.
    XXXIII.      Now these are the encampments of the Israelites.
        When they came out of the land of Egypt, with their army,
      2 by the ministry of Moses and Aaron, Moses committed to wri-
        ting their removals and encampments, by the command of the
       Lord, and these are the encampments of their march.
      3    They removed from Ramesses, in the first month, on the
       fifteenth day of the first month.On the next morning after
        the passover, the Israelites came out with a high hand, in the
      4 sight of all the Egyptians, while they were burying their dead
        â€”all those whom the Lord had smittenâ€”even all the first
        born of the land of Egypt.   When the Lord had executed
      5 vengeance on their gods, the children of Israel, removing
     6 from Ramesses, encamped at Sokchoth.    And removing from
        Sokchoth, they encamped at Bouthan, which is a part of
      7 the wilderness. And they removed from Bouthan, and en-
        camped at the mouth of Eirath, which is over against Beelsep-
      8 phon.  They encamped also over against Magdolus.      And
        they removed from over against Eirath, and crossed through
        the midst of the sea, into the wilderness, and having marched
        three days' journey through the wilderness, they encamped at
      9 Bitterness.And they removed from Bitterness, and came to
        Ailam.  Now at Ailam there were twelve fountains of water,
        and seventy palm trees.So they encamped there by the water.
     10 And they removed from Ailam, and encamped by the Red
     11 sea. And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in
     12 the wilderness of Sin.And they removed from the wilderness
     13 of Sin, and encamped at Raphaka.   And they removed from
      Ch. XXXIII.           NUMBERS.
      14 Raphaka, and encamped at xiilus. Aud they rem oved from
         Ailus and encamped at Raphadin, where there was no water
      15 for the people to drink.And they removed from Raphadin,
      16 and encamped in the wilderness of Sina.And they removed
         from the wilderness of Sina, and encamped at The monu-
      17 ments of longing desire.And they removed from The monn-
      18 ments of longing desire, and encamped at Aseroth.And they
      19 removed from Aseroth, and encamped at Rathama. And they
         removed from Rathama, and encamped at Remmon-Phares.
      20 And they removed from Remmon-Phares, and encamped at
      21 Lebona.  And they removed from Lebona, and encamped at
      22 Ressan. And they removed from Ressan, and encamped at
      23 Makellath. And they removed from Makellath, and encamp-
      24 ed at Saphan. And they removed from Saphan, and encamp-
      25 ed at Charadath. And they removed from Charadath, and en-
      26 camped at Makeloth. xlnd they removed from Makeloth, and
      27 encamped at Kataath.  And they removed from Kataath, and
      28 encamped at Tarath. And they removed from Tarath, and en-
      29 camped at Mathekka.  And they removed from Mathekka, and
      30 encamped at Selmona. And they removed from Selmona, and
      31 encamped at Masnruth.  And they removed from Masnrnth,
      32 and encamped at Banaia.  And they removed from Banaia,
      33 and encamped at the mountain of Gadgad.And they remov-
         ed from the mountain of Gadgad, and encamped at Etebatha.
      34 And they removed from Etebatha, and encamped at Ebrona.
      35 And they removed from Ebrona, and encamped at Gesion-
      36 Gaber. And they removed from Gesion-Gaber, and encamped
         in the wilderness of Sin.And they removed from the wil-
         derness of Sin, and encamped in the wilderness of Pharan,
      37 this is Kades.And they removed from Kades, and encamp-
      38 ed at Or, the mountain bordering on the land of Edom.And
         Aaron the priest went up at the command of the Lord, and
         died there, in the fortieth year of the children of Israel's com-
         ing out of Egypt, in the fifth month, the first day of the
      39 month.  And Aaron was a hundred and twenty three years old
      40 when he died at mount Or. And the Chananite king of Arad,
         whose fixed abode was in the land of Chanaan, received intel-
         ligence when the children of Israel were marching in.And
      41 they removed from mount Or, and encamped at Selmona.And
     Ch. XXXIV.                 NUMBERS.
     43 they removed from Selmona, and encamped at Phino.          And
     44 they removed from Phino, and encamped at Oboth.      And they
        removed from Oboth, and encamped at Gai, on the borders
     45 of Moab.     And they removed from Gai, and encamped at
     46 Daibon-gad.    And they removed from Daibon-gad, and en-
     47 camped at Gelmon-deblathaim.     And they removed from Gel-
        mon-deblathaim, and encamped on the mountains Abarim, over
     48 against Nabo.   And they removed from the mountains Abarim,
        and encamped on the west of Moab, by the Jordan, opposite to
        Jericho.
     49     And when they were encamped on the Jordan, from Aisi-
     50 moth to Belsa, which is on the west of Moab, the Lord spoke
        to Moses on the west of Moab by the Jordan, in front of Jericho,
     51 saying, Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to
        them, You are now going to cross the Jordan into the land of
     52 Chanaan.   You shall destroy all those who dwell in that land,
        from before you, and demolish their obelisks, and utterly de-
        stroy their molten images, and all their pillars you shall demo-
     53 lish.  And when you have destroyed all the inhabitants of that
        land, you shall dwell therein ; for I have given you their land
        by lot, and you shall divide their land, by lot, among your
     54 tribes. To those who are more numerous you shall give a
        larger possession ; and to those who are fewer in number you
        shall give a smaller possession.  On whatever place any one's
        name falleth, there shall be his possession. According to the
     55 tribes of your families you shall possess it.But if you do not de-
        stroy the inhabitants of the land from before you, it will come to
        pass, that those of them whom you shall leave, will be thorns in
        your eyes, and darts in your sides, and your mortal enemies
     56 in the land wherein you dwell.   x\.nd it will come to pass that
        I will deal with you as I determined to deal with them.
     XXXIV.       Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses saying, Give a
        charge to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them,
      2 You are about to enter the laud of Chanaan.     This you shall
        have for an inheritance, even the whole land of Chanaan, with
      3 its borders.  And your southern border shall be, from the wil-
      4 derness of Sin, until it joineth Edom.    And your boundaries
         on the south shall be, from a part of the salt sea on the east,
         and that boundary shall encompass you on the south, to the
            vol. i.                 o o
                                                                              â€”;;

           ascent of Acrabin, and shall pass on to Ennak, and run along
           south of Kades-barne and come to the sheepcot of Arad, and
         5 pass along by Asemona : and from Asemona the boundary-
           shall wind round along the brook of Egypt, and its termination
         6 shall be the sea.   Then you shall have the sea for a boundary.
           The great sea shall bound you : this shall be your western
         7 boundary.    And your boundary on the north shall be this
           from the great sea you shall measure off for yourselves, along
         S the range of mountainsâ€”from mountain to mountain you shall
           measure off for yourselves : beginning at the bay of Emath,
         9 and extending along the border of Saradak, the boundary
           shall come out along the borders of Dephrona and its termina-
           tion shall be Arsenain.     This shall be your northern boundary.
       10 Then you shall measure off for yourselves the eastern boun-
       11 dary from Arsenain to Seppharuar; and from Sepphamar the
           boundary shall run down to Bela, on the east of the fountains,
           then down along the borders of Bela, on the eastern side of the
       12 sea of Chenerith ; then down the Jordan ; and its termination
       13 shall be the salt sea. This shall be your land and these its bounda-
           ries round about.    So Moses gave a charge to the Israelites say-
           ing, This is the land which you shall parcel out, by lot, in the man-
           ner the Lord hath commanded it to be given to the nine tribes,
       l-l and to the half of the tribe of Manasses ; because the tribe of
           the Reubenites, and the tribe of the Gadites, according to the
           houses of their families, and the half of the tribe of the Manas-
       15 sites, have received their allotments.      Two tribes, and the half
           of a tribe, have received their lots on the south east side of the
           Jordan, in front of Jericho.
       16      Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, These are the
       17 names of the men who shall parcel out the land for youâ€”Ele-
       18 azar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nave,          xlnd you shall
           take one chief of a tribe to divide the land among you by lot.
       19 And these are the names of the menâ€”Of the tribe of Judas,
       20 Chaleb son of Jephonne ; of the tribe of Symeon, Salamiel son
       21 of Samiud ; of the tribe of Benjamin, Eldad son of Chaslon
       22 of the tribe of Dan, chief Bakchir, son of Egli ; of the children
       23 of Josephâ€”of the tribe of the Manassites, chief Aniel, son of
       24 Suphi; of the tribe of the Ephraimites, chief Kamuel, son of
       25 Sabathan ; of the tribe of Zabulon, chief Elisaphan, son of
       26 Pharnach ; of the tribe of Issachar, chief Phaltiel, son of Oza
     Ch. XXXV.                  NUMBERS.
     27 Of the tribe of Aser, chief Achior, son of Selemi ; of the tribe
     28 of Nephthaleim, chief Phadael, son of Jamiud.     To these the
     29 Lord gave it in charge to parcel out to the Israelites their allot-
        ments in the land of Chanaan.
     XXXV.       Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, on the west of
        Moab, by the Jordan, over against Jericho, saying, Command
      2 the children of Israel ; and let them give the Levites, out of the
        lots of their possession, cities to dwell in.They shall also give
      3 the Levites the suburbs of these cities round about. The cities
        shall be for them to dwell in ; and the suburbs thereof shall be
      4 for their cattle, even for all their beasts.Now the suburbs of
        the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall be from the
        wall of the city, outwards, two thousand cubits all around.
      5 Thou shalt therefore measure off, outwards from the city,
        on the east side two thousand cubits, on the south side two
        thousand cubits, on the west side two thousand cubits, and on
        the north side two thousand cubits, and in the middle of this
        shall be your city ; and you shall give these suburbs of the ci-
      6 ties with the cities, to the Levites.Six of the cities which you
        shall give shall be cities of refuge for the manslayer to flee to,
      7 and besides these you shall give forty two cities.All the cities,
      8 which you shall give to the Levites, shall be forty eight.These
        cities with their suburbs, even the cities which you shall give,
        shall be from the possessions of the children of Israel. They
        shall give the Levites, out of their cities, many from those who
        have many, and few from them who have few ; from every one
        according to the inheritance which they possess.
      9    Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the
     10 children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, You are about
        to cross the Jordan into the land of Chanaan, and you will set
        apart for yourselves cities, which shall be your places of refuge,
     11 to which the manslayer may flee. When any person killeth ano-
     12 ther unwittingly, those cities will be places of refuge from the

     13 before the congregation for trial.Therefore, with regard to the
        cities which you shall give, six shall be your places of refuge ;
     14 three of these cities you shall give on this side of the Jordan, and
     15 three such cities you shall give in the land of Chanaan. They
        shall be a refuge for the children of Israel, and for the prose-
        lyte, and the sojourner among you.  These cities are to be pla-

          ces of refuge, to which every one may flee who hath smitten a
       16 person unawares.    But if he hath smitten him with an instru-
           ment of iron, and he die, he is a murderer ; let the murderer be
       17 put to death.   And if he hath smitten him with a stone out of
           his hand, by which he might be killed, and he die ; he is a mur-
       18 derer ; let the murderer be put to death.    And if he hath smit-
           ten him with any instrument of wood out of his hand, by which
          he might be killed, and he die ; he is a murderer ; let the mur-
       19 derer be put to death.    The avenger of blood himself shall kill
       20 him.   When he meeteth him he shall slay him. And if, through
           hatred, he hath pushed him down, or thrown at him from am-
       21 bush, any instrument whatever, and he die; or if on account
           of an old grudge he hath smitten him with his hand, and he die ;
           let him who smote be put to death : he is a murderer ; let the
           murderer be put to death.    The avenger of blood shall slay the
       22 murderer when he meeteth him.          But if on a sudden, not
          through malice aforethought, he hath pushed him down, or
       23 thrown any instrument at him, not from ambush, nor with any
          stone by which he might be killed, or not seeing him, and it
       24 light upon him, and he die, and he was not his enemy, nor
           seeking to do him any injury, the congregation shall judge be-
          tween him who smote, and the avenger of blood, according to
       25 these rules of decision ; and the congregation shall deliver the
           slayer from the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall
           send him back to the city of his refuge, to which he fled ; and
           he shall dwell there, till the death of the high priest, whom they
       26 have anointed with holy oil.     And if the manslayer go out of
           the bounds of the city of his refuge to which he fled, and
       27 the avenger of blood find him out of the bounds of the city
       28 of his refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the slayer, he
           is not guilty of death.    For he should have remained in the
           city of refuge till the death of the high priest.       After the
           death of the high priest the slayer may return to the land
       29 of his possession.     These shall    be your rules of decision,
       30 for your generations, in all your dwellings.       When any one
           hath slain a person, thou shalt put to death the murderer,
           by witnesses ; but one witness shall not testify against a person
       31 to cause him to be put to death.       And you shall take no ran-
           som for life from a manslayer who is guilty of death ; for he
       32 must be put to death : nor shall you take any ransom from him

         who hath fled to a city of refuge, that he may dwell again in
     33 his land, until the death of the high priest.   So you will not pol-
         lute with blood the land in which you dwell ; for this blood
         polluteth the land ; and the land cannot be cleansed from the
         blood which is shed in it, but by the blood of him who shed it.
     34 You must not defile the land in which you dwellâ€”in which I
         dwell among you ; for I the Lord dwell among the children of
         Israel.
     XXXVI.         Then came the chiefs of the community of the chil-
         dren of Galaad, son of Machir, son of Manasses, of the tribe
         of the children of Joseph, and spoke before Moses, and before
         Eleazar the priest, and before the chiefs of the patriarchal
       2 houses of the Israelites, and said, The Lord hath commanded
         our lord to give the land of inheritance by lot to the children
         of Israel ; and the Lord hath commanded our lord to give the
       3 inheritance of Salpaad, our brother, to his daughters.         Now
         they may become wives to one of the communities of the Is-
         raelites, and their lot may be taken from the possession of our
         fathers, and added to the inheritance of that tribe among which
         they may be married ; so their inheritance may be taken from
       4 the lot of our inheritance ; and though there may be a jubilee
         of the children of Israel, still their inheritance will be added to
         the inheritance of the tribe among whom they may have been
         married, and their inheritance will be taken from the inheri-
       5 tance of our patriarchal tribe.   Whereupon Moses gave a charge
         to the children of Israel, by the command of the Lord, saying,
       6 In regard to what the tribe of the children of Joseph say, This
         is the thing which the Lord hath commanded the daughters
         of Salpaad, saying, Let them marry whom they please, but
       7 they must marry men of the community of their father, so there
         shall be no transferring of inheritance among the children of
         Israel, from one tribe to another.     Because the children of Is-
         rael must be kept together, every one in the inheritance of the
       8 patriarchal family of his tribe, therefore every daughter, who
         by being next of kin, inheriteth a possession among the tribes of
         Israel, must marry one of the community of her father, that
         the children of Israel may inherit by nearness of kin, every one
       9 the inheritance of his father's family : by which means the al-
          lotment will not be transferred from one tribe to another ; but
                         â€”                                                                            â€”
         Ch. XXXVI.                              NUMBERS.
              the Israelites will be kept together every one in his inheritance.
         10        Accordingly they did, for the daughters of Salpaad, in the
         11 manner the Lord commanded Moses, and Thersa, and Egla,
              and Melcha, and Nua, and Maala, the daughters of Salpaad,
         12 were married to their cousins.                     They were married to men of
              the tribe of Manasses, one of the sons of Joseph, and their in-
              heritance was kept in the tribe, to which the community of
              their father belonged.
         13        These are the commands, and the statutes, and the judg-
              ments, which the Lord gave in charge, by the ministry of
              Moses, on the west of Moab, on the Jordan, over against
              Jericho.

         I.       These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel, on
             the bank of the Jordan, west of the wilderness which reacheth
             to the Red sea, between Pharantophal and Lobon, and Aulon,
          2 and Katachrusea, eleven days' journey from Choreb, the way
             by mount Seir to Kades-Barne.
          3        In the fortieth year, the eleventh month, on the first day
             of the month, Moses spoke to all the children of Israel, accord-
          4 ing to all that the Lord had given him in charge to them.                              After
             he had smitten Seon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Ese-
          5 bon ;      and Og, king of Basan, who dwelt at Astaroth and
             Edrain, Moses began, on the bank of the Jordan, in the land
             of Moab, to explain the law fully, saying.
          6       The Lord our God spoke to us at Choreb, saying, You
          7 have tarried long enough by this mount.                            Turn ; strike your
             tents, and march to the mountain of the Amorites, and to all
             the inhabitants around Arabaâ€”to the mountain and to the
             plain, and to the south, and to the land of the Chananites, on
             the sea shore, and to Antilibanus, till you reach the river
         8 the great river Euphrates.                 Behold I have delivered up the land
             before you.         Go in, and take possession of the land, which
             with an oath I promised to give to your fathersâ€”to Abraham,
             and Isaak, and Jacobâ€”to them and their seed after them.
         9        Then I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able
        10 alone to bear you.              The Lord your God hath multiplied you
                                                                                                         ;
                                                                           a
          T.                  DEUTERONOMY.
     Ch.
         and behold you are this day like the stars of heaven for mul-
     11 titude.   May the Lord, the God of your fathers, add to you a
         thousand times as many as you are, and bless you as he hath
     12 promised' you !    How can I alone bear the burden of you, even
     13 the whole weight of you, and your contentions ?        Appoint for
         yourselves men of wisdom, knowledge and understanding, for
         your several tribes, and I will make them leaders over you.
     14 And you answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast
     15 proposed to do is good.     So I took from among you men of
         wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, and appointed them
         to be leaders over youâ€”captains of thousands, and captains
         of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens ; and
     16 promulgators of the law for your judges.      And I gave a charge
         to your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between
         your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and
     17 his brother, and the stranger who is with him.      Thou shalt not
         respect a person in judgment.     Against the low and the high
         thou shalt pass sentence, and not be afraid of the face of man ;
         for the judgment is God's.     And if the matter be too hard for
     18 you, bring it to me, and I will hear it.    And when I had given
     19 you in charge, at that time, all the things which you were to
         do, we removed from Choreb, and marched through all that
         great and frightful wilderness which you saw, on the way to
         the mountain of the Amorite, as the Lord our God command-
     20 ed us.    And when we came to Kades-barne, I said to you,
         You are come to the mountain of the Amorite, which the
     21 Lord our God giveth you.        Behold the Lord your God hath
         delivered up to you the land before you.      Go up and take pos-
         session of it, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, commanded
     22 you.    Fear not, nor be faint hearted.   Whereupon you all came
         to me, and said, Let us send men before us, and let them tra-
         verse the land for us, and bring us word what way we shall go
     23 up, and to what cities we shall come.       And the proposal was
         agreeable to me.     So I took from among you twelve menâ€”
     24 man for every tribe.      And they turned, and went up to the
     25 mountain, and came to the valley of the bunch of grapes.        And
         when they had thoroughly viewed it, they took in their hands
         some of the fruit of the land, and brought it to you, and said,
     26 The land is good, which the Lord our God giveth us.            Not-
      Ch. I.                  DEUTERONOMY.
      27 withstanding this, you would not go up ; but disobeyed the
          command of the Lord our God, and murmured in your tents,
          saying, Because the Lord hateth us he hath brought us out of
          the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hands of the Amo-
      28 rites, to destroy us utterly, wherever we go. When your bre-
          thren disheartened you, saying, It is a nation great and nume-
          rous, and stronger than we ; and the cities are large, and wal-
          led up to the sky.  Indeed we have seen there sons of giants.
      29 I said to you, Be not terrified, nor afraid of them.The Lord
      30 your God is marching before you.   He will assist you in subdu-
          ing them, according to all that he hath done for you in the land
      31 of Egypt, and in that wilderness, which you have seen in your
          march to this mountain of the Amorite.    The Lord thy God
          will take charge of thee, as a man would of a sonâ€”as he hath
      32 done all the way you marched, till you came to this place.Not-
      33 withstanding this speech you did not confide in the Lord our
          God who was marching before you in the way to chuse a place
          for you, conducting you by night with fire, pointing out to
          you the way in which you were to march ; and by day, with
      34 a pillar of cloud. And the Lord heard the sound of your words,
       35 and being provoked to wrath, he sware saying, Not one of
          these men shall see that good land which I, with an oath, pro-
      36 mised their fathers, save Chaleb son of Jephonne.    He shall
          see it.And to him I will give the land to which he went up,
          and to his children, because he vindicateth the cause of the
      37 Lord.   With me also the Lord was angry on your account,
      38 and said, Neither shalt thou go in there.  Joshua son of Nave
      39 who is thy attendantâ€”he shall go thither.     Encourage him,
          for he shall distribute it, by lot, to Israel.And with respect
          to your children, who do not know good or evil, they shall
          go thither, and to them I will give it, and they shall inherit it.
       40 But as for you, turn, and march into the wilderness, by the way
       41 to the Red sea.  Then you answered, and said, We have sin-
          ned before the Lord our God.    We will go up, and fight ac-
          cording to all that the Lord our God commanded us.  So, every
          one seizing his implements of war, you assembled tumultu-
       42 ously to go up the mountain.   Whereupon the Lord said to
          me, Say to them, You shall not go up, nor fight ; for I am not
       43 with you.  And you should not be trodden down before your
                 II.

               enemies.         Accordingly I spoke to you ; but you hearkened not
               to me ; but transgressed the command of the Lord, and pre-
         44 sumptuously ascended the mountain.                                  And the Amorites, who
               dwelt on the mountain, came out to meet you, and pursued
               you, as bees would do, and slaughtered you from Seir to Her-
         45 ma.         Then you sat down, and wept before the Lord our God
                                                                                                                       ;
               but the Lord hearkened not to your voice, nor paid attention to
               you.      So you abode at Kades many days, as many as you had
         II.         staid there before.              Then we turned, and took up our march
               into the wilderness, by the way to the Eecl sea, as the Lord
           2 spoke to me.                And when we had been many days circling
           3 round mount Seir, the Lord said to me, You have been long-
              enough circling round this mountain, therefore turn northward,
          4 and give thou a charge to this people, saying, r
                                                                                               You are about
              to march along by the borders of your brethren, the children
              of Esau who inhabit Seir.                        They will be afraid of you, and
                                                            r
          5 dread you exceedingly.                        You must not come to battle with
              them ; for I will not give you a foot of their land, because I
              have given mount Seir to the children of Esau for a possession.
          6 Buy provisions of them for money, that you may eat, and re-
              ceive of them water by measure, for money, that you may
          7 drink ; (for the Lord our God had blessed thee in all the works
              of thy hands.)
                   Recollect how thou didst traverse that great and frightful
              wilderness.          Behold ! for forty years the Lord thy God was with
          8 thee.        Thou wast not in want of any thing.                              And when we had
             passed by our brethren the children of Esau, who inhabit
              Seir, by the way of Araba, from Ailon to Gesion-gaber, and
          9 wheeling about had crossed the wilderness of Moab, the Lord
             said to me, Act not as enemies against the Moabites ; nor come
             to a battle with them ; for I will not give you for a possession
             any of their land ; for I have given Aroer to the children of Lot,
        10 that they may inherit it.                     (Now the Omminshad formerly dwelt
        11 there, a nation great and numerous, and mighty as the Ena-
             kimsâ€”they as well as the Enakims may be accounted Ra-
        12 phains ; but the Moabites call them Ommins.                                     And in Seir the
             Chorrites were formerly settled, but the children of Esau de-
             stroyed them, and rooted them out from before them, and dwelt
             in their stead, in the same manner as Israel hath done with the

      13 land of their possession which the Lord hath given them.)   Now
          therefore arise, and strike your tents, and cross the valley of
          Zaret.
      14     Now the time we spent from Kades-barne till we came to
          the valley of Zaret, was thirty eight years ; until all the genera-
      15 tion of the warriors had fallen, and died out of the camp.    As
          the Lord had, with an oath denounced against them, the hand
          of the Lord was upon them to destroy them from among the
      16 host until they had all fallen.   And when all the warriors had
      17 fallen, and died from among the people, the Lord spoke to me,
          saying, Thou art now to pass by Aroer, along the borders of
      18 Moab ; when you come near to the children of Amman you
      19 must not act hostilely against them, nor come to battle with
          them ; for I will not give thee any of the land of the children
          of Amman for a possession ; because I have given it for a pos-
      20 session to the children of Lot.   (It may be accounted the land
          of the Eaphains, for the Raphains formerly dwelt there, but the
      21 Ammanites call them Zochommins.        They, as well as the Ena-
          kims, were a nation great and numerous, and much stronger
          than you ; but the Lord destroyed them from before the Am-
          manites, and they took possession of the country, and have
      22 dwelt therein in their stead, even to this day.    The same was
          the case with the children of Esau who inhabit Seir, they, in
          like manner, destroyed the Chorrites from before them, and
          took possession of their country, and have dwelt therein, in
      23 their stead, even to this day.   So it was with the Evites when
          they dwelt in Asedoth even to Gaza, the Cappadocians, who
          came out of Cappadocia, rooted them out, and dwelt in their
      24 stead.)  Now therefore arise, strike your tents, and cross the
          vale of Arnon ; behold I have delivered into thy hand Seon,
          king of Esebon, the Amorite, with his land.  Begin to take pos-
      25 session.  Join battle with him this day.   Begin to impress the
          fear of thee, and the dread of thee, on the face of all the nations
          under heaven.   They who hear of thy name shall tremble, and
          be in anguish because of thee.
      26     Now I had sent messengers from the wilderness of Keda-
      27 moth to Seon, king of Esebon, with words of peace, saying,
          Let me pass through thy land.      I will march along the high-
      28 way, and not turn aside to the right, nor to the left.Thou shalt
     Ck. III.                DEUTERONOMY.
         sell me provisions for money, that I may eat ; and thou shalt
         sell me water for money, that I may drink, just till I can march
     29 through on foot ; as the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir,
         and the children of Moab, who dwell in Aroer have done to
         me, until I cross the Jordan, to the land which the Lord our
     30 God giveth us.    But Seon, king of Esebon, would not consent
         that we should pass by him, for the Lord our God had embold-
         ened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might be
         delivered into thy hands, as at this day.
     31     Then the Lord said to me, Behold I have begun to deliver
         up before thee Seon, king of Esebon, the Amorite, and his land.
     32 Begin therefore to take possession of his land.   So Seon, king
         of Esebon, came out to meet us, he and all his people, to bat-
     33 tie at Jassa.  And the Lord our God delivered him up before
     34 us.  And we smote him and his sons, and all his people, and
         took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed every city
     35 one after another ; with their wives and children. We left none
        to be taken alive.   Besides making a prey of their cattle, we
     36 took the spoils of their cities. From Aroer, which is on the
        banks of the brook Arnon, including the city in the vale, even
        to mount Galaad, there was not a city which escaped us.     The
     37 Lord our God delivered them all into our hands.       Moreover,
        when, without approaching the children of Amman, we had
        taken all his territories on the brook Jabok, and his cities in
        the hilly country, as the Lord our God commanded us, we
     III.    turned and went up the way to Basan.       And when Og,
      2 king of Basan came out to meet us, he and all his people, to
        battle at Edrain, the Lord said to me, Fear him not ; for into
        thy hand I have delivered him, and all his people, and all his
        land ; and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Seon, the
      3 king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Esebon.     So the Lord our
        God delivered also into our hands Og, king of Basan, and all
        his people, and we smote him till there was none of his seed left.
      4 And we took all his cities at that time.   There was not a city
        which we did not take from themâ€”three score cities, the whole
        region of Argob, belonging to Og, king of Basan ; All the ci-
      5 ties fortified with high walls, bars and gates, besides the towns
        of the Pherezites, which were very many, we utterly destroyed.
      6 As we had done to Seon, king of Esebon, we destroyed every
       Ch. III.                   DEUTERONOMY.
        7 city, one after another, and the women and children.           But all
           the cattle, and the spoils of the cities, we took for ourselves.
        8 So, at that time, we took this land out of the hands of the two
           kings of the Amorites, who were on the banks of the Jordan,
        9 from the brook Anion even to Aermon (now the Phoenicians
           call Aermon Sanior and the Amorites call it Sanir) including
       10 all the cities of Misor, and all Galaad, and all Basan, as far as
           Elcha, and Adraim, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan.
       11 (For besides Og, king of Basan, there was not one of the Ra-
          phains left.   Behold his bed was a bed of iron.       Behold it is in
          the citadel of the Ammanites.       The length of it is nine cubits,
          and the breadth of it four cubits, after the cubit of a man.)
       12 And we took possession of this land, at that time, from Aroer,
          which is on the bank of the brook Arnon, and the half of mount
           Galaad ; and I gave all the cities thereof to Reuben, and Gad.
       13 And the rest of Galaad, and all Basan, the kingdom of Og, I
          gave to the half of the tribe of Manasses, with all the region of
          Argob, even all that part of Basan which is to be accounted the
       14 land of the Raphains.      (Now when Jair the Manassite took the
          region of Argob, even to the borders of Gergesi, and Macha-
          thi, he called it after his own name Basan-Thavoth-Jair which
          is now its name.)
       15     Now when I gave Galaad to the Machirites and to Reu-
      16 ben and Gad, all below Galaad, to the brook Arnon, the
          middle of the brook being the boundary ; and as far as Jabok,
       17 this brook being the boundary of the Ammanites, and Araba,
           and the Jordan the boundary of Machanareth, even to the sea
       18 of Araba, the salt sea below Asedoth, the Phasga of the East,
          I gave you a charge at that time, saying, The Lord your God
          hath given you this land for a possession, you shall go armed
       19 before your brethren, the children of Israel, all of you who are
          fit for war, (but your wives, and your children, and your cat-
          tle, for I know that you have much cattle, are to dwell in your
      20 cities, which I have given you) until the Lord your God shall
          have given your brethren rest, as well as you ; and until they
          shall have taken possession of the land which the Lord our
       21 God giveth them, on the other side of the Jordan.           Then you
          shall return, every one to his possession which I have given
          you.    And at the same time I gave a charge to Joshua, saying,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;
                              IV.                                                          DEUTERONOMY.
                Oh.
                          Your eyes have seen all that the Lord our God hath done to
                          these two kings.                                            In the same manner the Lord our God will
                          deal with all those kingdoms against which you are going to
               22 cross over.                                     You shall not be afraid of them, for the Lord
               23 our God will fight for you.                                                                              I also supplicated the Lord, at
               24 that time, saying,                                                           Lord God, thou hast begun to shew thy
                          servant thy majesty, and thy power, and thy mighty hand, and
                          thy outstretched arm ; for what god is there in heaven, or on
                          earth, who can do as thou hast done, or according to thy ma-
               25 jesty.                         Let me cross over, and see that land, that good land
                         which is beyond the Jordan, and that goodly mountain Antili-
               26 banus.                            But the Lord overlooked me, because of you, and
                       , would not hearken to me.                                                                 And the Lord said to me, Let this
               27 suffice thee.                                       Speak no more on this subject.                                                                                 Go up to the
                         top of the craggy mountain, and raise thine eyes westward,
                          and northward, and southward, and eastward, and take a view
               28 of it with thine eyes ; for thou shalt not cross this Jordan.                                                                                                                                    And
                         give a charge to Joshua, and strengthen and encourage him
                         for he shall cross over before this people, and shall give them
                         the possession of all this land which thou hast seen.                                                                                                                                So we
                         halted at the forest, near the house of Phogor.
              IV.                      Now therefore, hear,                                                          Israel, the rules of rectitude, and
                         the judgments, which I this day teach you to practise, that you
                         may live, and multiply, and go in, and possess the land, which
                  2 the Lord the God of your fathers giveth you.                                                                                                                     You shall not
                         add any thing to what I command you ; nor shall you dimi-
                         nish from it.                                   You shall keep the commandments of the Lord
                  3 our God, which I, this day, give you in charge.                                                                                                                             Your eyes
                         have seen all that the Lord our God did because of Beelphe-
                         gorâ€”that as for every man who went after Beelphegorâ€”him
                  4 the Lord our God destroyed from among you.                                                                                                                      But as for you
                         who adhered to the Lord your God, you are all alive this day.
                  5 Behold, I have taught you rules of rectitude, and judgments,
                         as the Lord commanded me ; that you may act agreeably
                         thereto, in the land to which you are going, to take possession
                  6 of it.                     Therefore keep them, and practise them.                                                                                          For this will be
                         your wisdom, and your understanding, in the sight of all the
                         nations.                       Whoever shall chance to hear all these rules of recti-
                         tude, will say, Behold this is a wise and understanding people
                                                                                                           ;
          Ch. IV.                            DEUTEEONOMY.
           7 â€”a great nation.               For how great must that nation be, which
               hath God near them, as the Lord our God is on all occasions,
           8 if we call upon him ! And how great must the nation be,
               which hath such rules of rectitude, and such righteous judg-
               ments, as are contained in the whole law, which I this day lay-
               before you.
          9         Take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently.                               For-
               get not all the things which thine eyes have seen, and let them
               not depart from thy heart all the days of thy life ; that thou
               mayst impress upon thy children, and thy childrens' children,
          10 that day when you stood in the presence of the Lord our God
               at Choreb, on the day of the solemn assembly.                            For the Lord
               said to me, Assemble the people before me, and let them hear
               my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days they
          11 live on the earth.            And let them teach their children.                     So you
               came near and stood at the foot of the mountain.                            Though the
               mountain was blazing with fire up to heaven, there was dark-
          12 ness, thick darkness, a turbid tempest.                       And the Lord uttered
              to you, from the midst of the fire, the sound of words which
          13 you heard.           You saw no similitude, but only heard a voice.
              And when he had declared to you his covenant, which he
              commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments, he
          14 wrote them on two tables of stone.                       And the Lord command-
               ed me at that time to teach you rules of rectitude, and judg-
              ments, for you to practise in the land to which you are going,
         15 to take possession of it.                Therefore watch your souls with dili-
              gence ; for you saw no similitude on the day when the Lord
              spoke to you at Choreb, in the mount, out of the midst of the
          16 fire ; that you may not transgress, and make for yourselves
              a graven imageâ€”any kind of image, the likeness of man or
         17 woman ; the likeness of any of the beasts which are on the
              earth ; the likeness of any winged bird, which flieth in the air
         18 the likeness of any reptile, which creepeth on the ground ; the
              likeness of any fish which is in the waters below the earth ;
         19 and that upon looking up to heaven, and seeing the sun, and
              the moon, and the stars, and all the host of heaven, thou mayst
              not be led astray, and worship them, and perform religious ser-
              vice to those things which the Lord thy God hath arranged in
         20 due order, for all the nations which are under heaven.                            God hath
                                                                    â€”
    Ch. IV.                 DEUTERONOMY.
        indeed taken you and brought you out of the land of Egypt
        out of the iron furnaceâ€”out of Egypt, to be to him a chosen
    21 people, as at this day ; but with me the Lord God was angry for
        the things spoken by you, and he solemnly said that I should
        not cross this Jordan, and that I should not enter that land,
    22 which the Lord thy God giveth thee for a possession.      For I
        am to die in this land, and not to cross that Jordan ; but you
     23 are to cross it. When you shall possess that good land, take
        heed to yourselves, that you do not forget the covenant of the
        Lord our God, which he made with you, and transgress and
        make for yourselves a graven image of any of the things about
     24 which the Lord thy God hath given thee a charge ; for the
     25 Lord thy God is a consuming fireâ€”a zealous God.       If there-
        fore, when you have begotten sons, and sons' sons, and have
        been long in the land, you transgress, and make a graven image
        â€”the likeness of any thing whatever, and do evil in the sight of
     26 the Lord your God, to provoke him to wrath, I call heaven and
        earth this day to witness against you, that you shall surely pe-
        rish from the land, to which you are going, to cross the Jordan
        there to take possession of it.You shall not prolong your days
     27 therein, but shall be utterly rooted out. And the Lord will scatter
        you among all the nations, and you shall be left few in number,
     28 among all the nations, to which the Lord will bring you.   And
        there you shall serve other gods, the works of men's hands,
        stocks and stones, which can neither see, nor hear, nor eat,
     29 nor smell.  Y'et there, on seeking the Lord your God you will
        find him, when you seek him with your whole heart and with
     30 your whole soulâ€”In thy affliction, when all these things have
        come upon thee in the latter days, when thou shalt turn to the
        Lord thy God, and hearken to his voice ; because the Lord
     31 thy God is a merciful God ; he will not forsake thee utterly,
        nor totally destroy thee.  He will not forget the covenant of
         thy fathers, which the Lord confirmed to them with an oath.
     32     Enquire of the days which are pastâ€”those which were be-
         fore thee, from the day God created man on the earth, and
         from one end of heaven to the other; hath there ever been
     33 any thing like this great thing ?   Hath any thing been heard
         like it ?Hath any nation heard the voice of the living God,
         speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and
            IV.                 DEUTERONOMY.
       Ch.
       34 are still alive ? Or hath God come, and made trial to take for
           himself a nation out of the midst of a nation, by trials, and by
           signs, and by wonders, and by war, and with a strong hand,
           and an outstretched arm, and with great visions, according to
           all that the Lord our God hath done in Egypt, before thine
       35 eyes ?   So that thou must needs know that the Lord thy God is
       36 very God, and that there is none else besides him.          From
           heaven he caused his voice to be heard to instruct thee ; and
           on earth he shewed thee his great fire. And thou hast heard his
       37 words out of the midst of the fire.    Because he loved thy fa-
           thers, he chose you their seed after them ; and by his mighty
       38 power he hath brought thee out of Egypt, to destroy nations
           greater and mightier than thou art, before theeâ€”to bring thee
           in, and give thee their land for a possession, as is the case with
       39 thee this day.   Know therefore this day, and revolve it in thy
           mind, that the Lord thy God is alone God, in the heaven
           above, and in the earth beneath, and that there is none other
       40 besides him.    You shall therefore keep his commandments,
           and his rules of rectitude, which I this day give you in charge,
          that it may be well with thee and with thy children after thee
           â€”that you may live long in the land, which the Lord thy God
           sriveth thee for ever.
       41     Then Moses set apart three cities on the side of Jordan, to-
       42 wards the rising of the sun, for the slayer to flee to. Whoever
          should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times
       43 past, might flee to one of these cities, and live, namely, Bo-
          sor, in the wilderness, in the plain, for the Eeubenites ; and
          Bamoth, in Galaaditis, for the Gadites; and Gaulon, in Ba-
          san, for the Manassites.
       44     This is the law which Moses laid before the children of
       45 Israelâ€”these are the testimonies, and the rules of rectitude,
          and the judgments, which Moses delivered in his speech to
       46 the Israelites, after they came out of the land of Egypt on
          the bank of the Jordan, in the vale near the house of Phogor,
          in the land of Seon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Esebon,
          whom Moses and the Israelites slew after their coming out of
          the land of Egypt, when they took possession both of this
          land, and the land of Og king of Basan, the two kings of the
          Amorites, who were on the side of the Jordan towards the

   49 brook Arnon, to the mountain of Seon, which is Aermon,
       comprehending all that part of Araba on the eastern bank of
       Jordan, below the cliff of Asedoth.
   V.     When Moses had convened all Israel, he said to them>
       Hear,   Israel, the rules of rectitude and the judgments, which
       I this day deliver in your hearing, that you may learn them,
       and may be careful to perform them.
     2    The Lord your God made a covenant with you at Choreb.
    3 It was not only with your fathers that the Lord made this co-
       venant, but with you alsoâ€”with you who are all here alive
    4 this day.  Face to face the Lord spoke to you, at that moim-
     5 tain, out of the midst of the fire.I indeed stood between the
       Lord and you, at that time, to declare to you the words of the
       Lord, because you were terrified at the fire, and did not go
    6 up to the mountain ; and he said, I am the Lord thy God, who
       brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bon-
    7 dage.   Thou shalt have no other gods before me.  Thou shalt
    8 not make for thyself an idol, nor the likeness of any thing in
       the heaven above, or of any of the things which are on the earth
     9 below, or which are in the waters below the earth.Thou shalt
       not worship them, nor serve them ; for I am the Lord thy God,
       a zealous God, retributing, to them who hate me, the sins offa-
       thers upon children, to the third and fourth generation, and
   10 shewing mercy for thousands [of generations] to them who
   11 love me, and keep my commandments.       Thou shalt not take
       the name of the Lord thy God in vain ; for the Lord thy God
    12 will not purify him who taketh his name in vain.Keep the day
       of the sabbaths to hallow it, as the Lord thy God hath coni-
    13 manded thee.  Labour six days, and do all thy works ; but on
    14 the seventh day are the sabbaths for the Lord thy God. On it
       thou shalt not do any workâ€”neither thou nor thy son, nor
       thy daughter, nor thy man servant nor thy maid servant, nor
       thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor the proselyte
       who sojourneth with thee ; that thy man servant, and thy maid
    15 servant, and thy labouring beast may rest as well as thou.Re-
       member that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that
       the Lord thy God brought thee out thence, with a strong
       hand and an outstretched arm ; for this cause the Lord thy
          vol. I.                   q q
                           DEUTEEONOMY.
      Ch V.
         God hath commanded thee to keep the day of the sabbaths
      16 and hallow it. Honour thy father and thy mother, as the Lord
         thy God hath commanded thee, that it may be well with thee,
         and that thou mayst live long in the land which the Lord thy
      17 God giveth thee.    Thou shalt not commit murder.     Thou
         shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt
      21 not bear false witness against thy neighbour.Thou shalt not
         covet thy neighbour's wife; thou shalt not covet thy neigh-
         bour's house, nor his field, nor his man servant, nor his maid
         servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any of his cattle, nor any
         thing which is thy neighbour's.
      22     These are the injunctions which the Lord delivered ver-
         bally, to all your congregation, at the mount, out of the midst
          of the fire.There was darkness, thick darkness, a turbid tem-
         pest, and a loud voice. And he added no more.   And having
         written them on two tables of stone, he gave them to me.
      23 Now when you heard the voice from the midst of the fire (the
          mountain indeed was burning with fire) you came to me, even
      24 all the leaders of your tribes, and your elders, and said, Behold
          the Lord our God hath shewn us his glory, and we have heard
          his voice from the midst of the fire.We have this day seen
      25 that God can speak to man, and he may live.   Now therefore
          let us not die, for this great fire will consume us, if we conti-
          nue any longer to hear the voice of the Lord our God ; and we
       26 shall die.For what mortal, who hath heard the voice of the
          living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have,
       27 can live. Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God
          may say, and thou shalt rehearse to us all that the Lord our
       28 God may speak to thee, and we will hear and do it.And the
          Lord heard the sound of your words when you spoke to me.
          And the Lord said to me, I have heard the sound of the words
          of this people, even all that they have spoken to thee.All that
       29 they have said is right.that they may have their heart so dis-
          posed in them as to fear me, and to keep my commandments
          continually, that it may be well with them, and their children
       30 for ever. Go say to them, Keturn to your houses. But as for
       31 thee, Stand thou here with me, and I will speak to thee all
          the commandments, and the rules of rectitude, and the judg-
          ments, which thou shalt teach them ; and let them act accord-
                                                                                                                          ;
        Ch. VI.                                   DEUTEKONOMY.
         32 ingly in the land which I give them for a possession.                                            Be care-
               ful therefore to do as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee.
         33 Turn not aside to the right, nor to the left, from walking in all
              the way which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, that
              he may give thee rest, and that it may be well with thee, and
              that you may live long in the land, of which you shall take pos-
              session.
        VI.           Now these are the commandments, and the rules of rec-
              titude, and the judgments, which the Lord our God command-
              ed you to be taught, that you may act conformably thereto in
              the land to which you are going, there to take possession of it
          2 that you may fear the Lord your God.                                     You shall keep all his
              statutes, and his commandments, which I this day command
              you, both thou, and thy children, and thy children's children,
          3 all the days of thy life, that you may live many clays.                                             There-
              fore hear,             Israel, and be careful to perform ; that it may be
              well with thee, and that you may be greatly multiplied, as the
              Lord, the God of thy fathers, hath promised to give thee a
              land flowing with milk and honey.                              These indeed are the rules
              of rectitude, and the judgments, which the Lord gave in charge
              to the children of Israel, in the wilderness, on their coming-
              out of the land of Egypt.
          I         Hear          Israel ! The Lord is our God.                      The Lord is one. And
          5 thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole understanding,
          6 and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole might.                                           And these
              injunctions, which I this day give thee in charge, shall be in thy
          7 heart, and in thy soul ; and thou shalt impress them on thy
              children, and speak of them, when thou sittest at home, and
              when thou art walking abroad, and when thou liest down, and
          8 when thou risest up ; and thou shalt bind them for a sign on
              thy right hand, and it shall be immoveably before thine eyes.
          9 You shall also Avrite them on the posts of your houses and
        10 gates.           And when the Lord thy God hath brought thee into
              the land, which, with an oath he promised to thy fathers, to
              Abraham, and Isaak, and Jacob, to give thee cities, great and
        11 beautiful, which thou hast not buildedâ€”houses full of all good
              things, which thou hast not filled ; cisterns of hewn stone,
              which thou hast not hewed ; vineyards, and olive yards which
      Ch. VII.                 DEUTERONOMY.
          thou hast not planted ; and when thou hast eaten, and art filled,
      12 take heed to thyself, that thou forget not the Lord thy God,
          who brought thee out of the land of Egyptâ€”out of the house
      13 of bondage.   Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him
      14 alone, and cleave to him, and swear by his name.     Go not af-
      15 ter other godsâ€”after any of the gods of the nations around
          you.  (For the zealous Godâ€”the Lord thy God is among you)
          lest the Lord thy God, being provoked to wrath against thee,
      16 destroy thee from the face of the land.  Thou shalt not try the
      17 Lord thy God, as you tried him at Temptation.    Thou shalt di-
          ligently keep the commandments of the Lord thy Godâ€”all
          the testimonies, and the rules of rectitude, which he shall give
      18 thee in charge; and thou shalt do what is well pleasing and
          good in the sight of the Lord thy God, that it may be well
          with thee, and that thou mayst go, in, and take possession of
      19 that good land, out of which the Lord hath, with an oath, pro-
          mised your fathers to drive all thine enemies from before thee,
      20 as the Lord hath spoken.    And when thy son shall, in time to
          come, ask thee, saying, What is the meaning of these testi-
          monies, and these rules of rectitude, and these judgments,
      21 which the Lord our God hath enjoined on us?          Then thou
          shalt say to thy son, We were servants to Pharao, in the
          land of Egypt, and the Lord brought us out thence, with a
      22 strong hand, and with an outstretched arm.       And when the
          Lord had shewn signs, and wonders, great, and grievous, in
      23 Egypt, on Pharao, and on his household, in our sight, he
          brought us out thence, to give us this land, which, with an
      24 oath, he promised to give our fathers ; and the Lord com-
          manded us to practise all these rulesâ€”to fear the Lord our
          God, that it may be well with us always, that Ave may live, as
      25 we now do.    For we shall find mercy, if we be careful to per-
          form all these commandments in the sight of the Lord our
          God, as he hath commanded us.
      VII.     Now when the Lord thy God hath brought thee into that
          land, to which thou art going, there to possess it, and hath re-
          moved from before thee mighty nationsâ€”the Chettite, and the
          Gergasite, and the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Phe-
          resite,and the Evite, and the Jebusite, seven nations, more
        2 numerous, and stronger than youâ€”When the Lord thy God
                           DEUTERONOMY.
     Ch. VII.
        shall deliver them into thy hands, thou shalt smite them ; thou
        shalt utterly destroy them ; thou shalt not make a covenant with
      3 them.  You shall neither shew them mercy, nor contract mar-
        riages with them. Thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son,
      4 nor take his daughter for thy son.For she will cause thy son
        to apostatise from me, and to serve other gods, and the Lord
        will be provoked to wrath against you, and speedily destroy
      5 thee. But in this manner thou shalt deal with themâ€”their al-
        tars you shall destroy ; their pillars you shall break to pieces ;
        their groves you shall cut down ; and the graven images of their
      6 gods you shall burn with fire.For thou art a people dedicated
        to the Lord thy God, and the Lord thy God hath chosen thee,
        to be a peculiar people to himself, in preference to all the na-
      7 tions which are on the face of the earth.It was not because
        you were the most numerous of all the nations, that the Lord
        preferred you, and made choice of you ; for you are the fewest
      8 of all the nations : but because the Lord loved you, therefore
        in performance of the oath which he swore to your fathers, the
        Lord led you out with a strong hand, and the Lord redeemed
        thee from the house of bondage, out of the hand of Pharao
      9 king of Egypt. Know therefore that the Lord thy God is the
        only Godâ€”the God to be confided in, who keepeth covenant
        and mercy for thousands of generations with them who love
     10 him, and keep his commandments ; and who requiteth to their
        face them who hate him, so as to destroy them. To them in-
        deed who hate him he will not be slack ; to their face he will
     11 requite them.  Therefore keep the commandments, and the
        rules of rectitude, and these judgments, which I this day com-
    12 mand thee to do.  And it shall come to pass, that if you hearken
        to these rules, and keep and practise them, the Lord thy God will
        keep with thee the covenant, and the mercy, which he, with an
    13 oath, confirmed to your fathers. And he will love thee, and
        bless thee, and multiply thee ; and he will bless the offspring of
        thy womb, and the product of thy landâ€”thy corn, and thy
        wine, and thine oil, thy herds of cattle, and thy flocks of sheep,
        in the land which he, with an oath, promised thy fathers to give
    14 thee.  Thou shalt be blessed above all the nations.There shall
        not be a male without a progeny, nor a female barren among
     15 you, or your cattle.And the Lord will remove from thee every
       Oh. VIII.              DEUTEKONOMY.
          malady, and will not lay upon thee any of the sore diseases of
          Egypt, which thou hast seen, which thou hast known : but will
       16 lay them upon all that hate thee.  And thou shalt consume all
          the spoils of the nations, which the Lord thy God giveth thee :
       17 Thine eye shall not have pity on them. And thou shalt not per-
          form religious service to their gods ; for this is a snare for thee.
          Now if thou shouldst say in thy heart, This nation is stronger
       18 than I ; how shall I be able to exterminate them ?Benotafraid
          of them ; but keep up a lively remembrance of all that the Lord
       19 thy God did to Pharao, and to all the Egyptiansâ€”the great
          trials which thine eyes have seen,â€”the signs and great won-
          dersâ€”the mighty hand, and the outstretched armâ€”As the
          Lord thy God brought thee out, so will the Lord your God
       20 deal with all the nations, of whom you are afraid.   The Lord
          thy God will indeed send hornets against them, until they who
       21 are left, and hid from thee, are utterly destroyed. Thou shalt
          not be affrighted at them; for the Lord thy Godâ€”the Great and
       22 Mighty God, is with thee.  The Lord thy God will indeed con-
          sume those nations from before thee, by little and little.Thou
          wilt not be enabled to destroy them at once, lest the land be-
       23 come a waste, and the wild beasts multiply against thee.  But
          the Lord thy God will deliver them into thy hands, and thou
          shalt destroy them with a great destruction, until you may ut-
       24 terly exterminate them.  When he shall deliver their kings into
          your hands, you shall destroy their name out of that place.
          None shall be able to stand before thee, until thou hast utterly
       25 destroyed them.   The graven images of their gods you shall
          burn with fire. Thou shalt not covet the silver nor the gold
          thereof. Thou shalt not take any of it for thyself, lest thou be
       26 ensnared by it.  Because it is an abomination to the Lord thy
          God, therefore thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy
          house ; for thou wilt be an Anathema as well as it. Thou shalt
          utterly detest it, and hold it in utter abomination ; for it is an
          Anathema, [a devoted thing.]
       VIII.    All the commands which I this day give you in charge
          you shall be careful to perform, that you may live, and be mul-
          tiplied, and go in, and possess the land which the Lord your
        2 God solemnly promised to your fathers ; and thou shalt keep
          in remembrance all the way which the Lord thy God led thee
         VIII.               DEUTERONOMY.
    Ch.
        in the wilderness, that he might afflict thee, and prove thee, and
        know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldst keep his
      3 commandments or not.      And when he had afflicted thee, and
        suffered thee to hunger, then he fed thee with manna, which
        thy fathers knew not, that he might shew thee, that man can
        live not on bread only ; but that man can live on any thing
      4 which God is pleased to appoint.      Thy garments did not be-
        come too old for thee, nor were thy shoes worn out from un-
      5 der thee ; nor the feet galled during the whole forty years ; so
        that thou must know in thy heart, that as a man chastiseth his
      6 son, so the Lord thy God will chasten thee ; keep therefore the
        commandments of the Lord thy God, by walking in his ways,
      7 and fearing him.     For the Lord thy God will bring thee to a
        good, and extensive land, where there are brooks of water, and
      8 fountains from the deeps, issuing forth from the plains, and
        from the hillsâ€”a land of wheat, and barley, where there are
        vineyards, and fig trees, and pomegranatesâ€”a land of oil-olive
      9 and honeyâ€”a land wherein thou shalt eat bread, without scar-
         city, and in which thou shalt not want any thingâ€”a land, the
         stones of which are iron, and out of the mountains of which thou
     10 shalt dig brass.   Therefore when thou hast eaten, and art satis-
         fied, thou shalt bless the Lord thy God in that good land, which
     11 he hath given thee.    Take heed to thyself, that thou forget not
         the Lord thy God, so as not to keep his commandments, and
         his judgments, and his rules of rectitude, which I this day
     12 command thee.      When thou hast eaten, and art satisfied, and
     13 hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein, and when thy
         herds, and thy flocks, are multiplied, and thou hast silver and
     14 gold in abundance, and all thy possessions are multiplied, be
         not elated in heart, nor forget the Lord thy God, who brought
         thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondageâ€”
      15 who conducted you through that great and frightful wilder-
         ness, where there were biting serpents and scorpions, and
         drought, where there was no waterâ€”who brought a fountain
      16 of water for thee out of a flinty rockâ€”who fed thee in the wil-
         derness with manna, which thou didst not know, and which
         was not known by thy fathers, that he might afflict thee, and
         try thee, and do thee good in thy latter days.
      17     Say not in thy heart, My own power, and the strength of
          IX.               DEUTERONOMY.
      Oh.
      18 ray own hand bath procured me this great wealth : but remem-
         ber the Lord thy God, that it is he who giveth thee power to
         procure wealth, that he may establish the covenant which the
      19 Lord made with thy fathers, as at this day.Indeed if thou for-
         get the Lord thy God, and go after other gods, and serve them,
         and worship them, I call heaven and earth this day to witness
      20 against you, that you shall surely perish.In like manner as
         the other nations which the Lord God destroyed before you,
         so shall you perish, because you have not hearkened to the
         voice of the Lord your God.
      IX.    Hear,    Israel ! Thou art now about to cross the Jordan,
         to go in to possess nations much greater and stronger than
       2 you, large cities, which are walled up to the sky, a people
         great and numerous, and of great stature, the children of Enak,
         whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard it said,
       3 Who can stand before the sons of Enak?  Know therefore this
         day, that the Lord thy God will himself march before thee.
         He is a consuming fire.He will destroy them. He will cause
         them to turn back from before thy face, and will destroy them
       4 speedily, as the Lord hath said to thee.Now when the Lord
         thy God hath destroyed those nations from before thee, speak
         not in thy heart, saying, On the account of my righteousness
       5 the Lord hath brought me in to possess this good land.It is
         not on the account of thy righteousness, nor for the sanctity
         of thy heart, that thou goest in to possess their land ; but, be-
         cause of the wickedness of those nations, the Lord will drive
         them out from before thee, and that he may establish his cove-
         nant which the Lord made with our fathersâ€”with Abraham,
       6 and Isaak, and Jacob. Know therefore this day, that it is not
         for thy righteousness that the Lord thy God giveth thee that
         good land for a possession ; for thou art a stiffnecked people.
       7 Rememberâ€”never forget how often thou hast provoked to
         wrath the Lord thy God, in the wilderness.From the day you
         came out of Egypt, till your coming to this place, you have
       8 gone on in a course of rebellion against the Lord.At Choreb
         you provoked the Lord, so that the anger of the Lord was kind-
       9 led against you, to destroy you utterly.When I went up the
         mountain to receive the tables of stoneâ€”the tables of the co-
         venant which the Lord had made with you.    Now I was on
       Ch. IX.                                  DEUTERONOMY.
       10 the mount forty days, and forty nights ; I neither ate bread nor
             drank water ; and the Lord gave me the two tables of stone,
             written with the finger of Godâ€”upon them indeed were writ-
             ten all the words which the Lord had spoken to you at the
       11 mount, on the day of the solemn assembly.                                        And after the for-
            ty days, and the forty nights, when the Lord gave me the two
            tables of stoneâ€”the tables of the covenant, the Lord said to
       12 me, Arise, go down quickly from this place : for thy people,
            whom thou hast brought out of Egypt, have transgressed.
            They have gone aside quickly out of the way, to which thou
            diclst enjoin them, and have made for themselves a molten
      13 image.            Moreover the Lord spoke to me, saying, I have
      14 spoken to thee once and again and said, I have seen this peo-
            ple, and behold it is a stiffnecked people ; now therefore let
            me utterly destroy them, and blot out their name from under
            heaven ; and I will make thee a nation, great and powerful, and
      15 much more numerous than this.                                    Whereupon I turned, and
            came down from the mount.                               Now the mount was blazing
            with fire up to heaven, and I had in my two hands the two
      16 tables of the testimonies.                        And when I saw that you had sin-
            ned before the Lord your G-od, and that you had made for
            yourselves a molten image, and had turned aside from the
            way in which the Lord had commanded you to walk; hav-
      17 ing hold of the two tables, I threw them out of my hands
      18 and broke them before your eyes.                                  Then I made supplication
            before the Lord, a second time, as I had done before, forty
            days and forty nightsâ€”(I neither ate bread nor drank wa-
            ter)â€”for your sins which you had committed by doing evil
      19 in the sight of the Lord God, to provoke him to wrath.                                                 Even
            now I tremble on account of the wrath and indignation.                                                For
            the anger of the Lord was kindled against you, to destroy
      20 you utterly.               But the Lord hearkened to me at that time also.
            Even against Aaron, his wrath was kindled to destroy him;
      21 But I prayed for Aaron also at that time.                                        Now I had taken
           your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire
                                                                                                                       ;
            and having stamped, and ground it, till it was very fine, and
            like dust, I threw the dust into the torrent which ran down
      22 out of the mount.                    At Burning also, and at Temptation, and at
      23 Monuments of longing desire, you provoked the Lord.                                                     And

                                                                                                                    ;
            Oh. X.                               DEUTERONOMY.
                  when the Lord sent you from Kades-barne, saying, Go up,
                  and take possession of the land which I give you, you dis-
                 obeyed the command of the Lord your God, and did not con-
            24 fide in him, nor hearken to his voice.                            You have been disobe-
                 dient to the commands of the Lord, from the day he made
                 himself known to you.
            25         When I was making supplication before the Lord, forty
            26 days, and forty nights, as I had done before (for the Lord spoke
                 of destroying you utterly,) I prayed to God, and said, O Lord,
                 thou king of all the gods, destroy not thy people, and thy he-
                 ritage, whom thou hast redeemed, whom thou hast brought
                 out of the land of Egypt, with thy mighty power, and with thy
           27 strong hand, and with thine outstretched arm.                                          Remember
                 Abraham, and Isaak, and Jacob, thy servants, to whom thou
                didst swear by thyself.                  Look not upon the stubbornness of
           28 this people, nor upon their wickedness, and their sins, lest
                they who dwell in the land, out of which thou hast brought
                them, should speak, saying, Because the Lord was not able to
                bring them into the land which he promised them ; and be-
                cause he hated them, he led them out into the wilderness to kill
           29 them.          Now these are thy people, and thy inheritance, whom
                thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, with thy mighty
                power, and with thy strong hand, and with thine outstretched
                arm.
           X.         At that time the Lord said to me, Hew thee out two ta-
                bles of stone like the first, and come up to me on the mount
            2 and thou shalt make thee an ark of wood, and thou shalt write
                on these tables the words which were on the first tables, which
            3 thou didst break, and shalt put them in the ark.                                     So when I
                had made an ark of incorruptible wood, and hewed two tables
                of stone, like the first, and had gone up the mount with the
            4 two tables in my hand ; and he had written on these tables,
                according to            the former writing, the ten commandments,
                which the Lord spoke to you at the mount, out of the midst
            5 of the fire ; and the Lord had given them to me, and I had
                turned, and come down from the mount, and had put these ta-
                bles in the ark which I had made, and they were there as the
            6 Lord commanded me, then the children of Israel removed out
                of Beroth, the country belonging to the children of Jakin, into
     Ch. XI.                 DEUTERONOMY.
        Misidai, the country where Aaron died, and where he was bu-
        ried, and Eleazar executed the office of priest in his stead.
      7 Thence they removed to G-adgad, and from Gadgad to Etaba-
      8 tha, a land abounding with streams of water.   Now the Lord,
        having at that time set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark
        of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord, and to
     9 serve, and bless in his name, as they do at this day, for this
        cause the Levites have no portion or lot among their brethren.
        The Lord is their portion, as he said to them.
    10     When I had been on the mount forty days, and forty
        nights, the Lord hearkened to me at that time also, for the
       Lord was not willing to destroy you utterly ; and the Lord
    11 said to me, Go, march before this people, and let them go in,
       and take possession of the land which I solemnly promised
    12 their fathers to give them. Now therefore,    Israel, what doth
       the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy
       God, and to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve
       the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole
    13 soulâ€”to keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and
       his rules of rectitude, which I this day command thee, that it
    14 may be well with thee ?   Behold the heaven, and the heaven of
       heavens, belong to the Lord thy God, the earth also, and all
    15 that are therein.  Nevertheless the Lord made choice of your
       fathers to love them ; and he chose you, their seed, after them,
    16 in preference to all the nations, as at this day.   Circumcise
       therefore the stubbornness of your hearts, and be no more stiff-
       necked.   For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of
    17 lordsâ€”the God, great, and mighty, and awful.       He respect-
    18 eth not persons, nor taketh a bribe.  He administereth justice
       to the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, and loveth the
    19 stranger, in giving him food and raiment.   Love ye therefore
       the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
    20 Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and cleave
   21 to him, and swear by his name.     He is thy boast ; and he is
       thy God, who hath done for thee those great, and those mar-
   22 vellous things which thine eyes have seen.   With seventy souls
       thy fathers went down to Egypt, and now the Lord thy God
   XL hath made thee like the stars ofheaven for multitude.    There-
       fore thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and keep his charges,
                                                                                                                           â€”â€”
            Ch. XL                                   DEUTERONOMY.
                 and his rules of rectitude, and his commandments, and his
              2 judgments, continually.                        You must now know, for I am not
                 addressing your children, who have not known, nor seen, the
                 chastisement of the Lord thy God, and his great acts, and his
             3 outstretched arm, and his signs, and his wonders, which he
                 did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharao, king of Egypt, and to
             4 all his land ; and what he did to the army of the Egyptians
                 to their chariots, and their cavalry, and their hostâ€”how the
                 Lord caused the water of the Red sea to overwhelm them,
                 when they were pursuing you, and destroyed them even to this
             5 day : and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you
             6 came to this place ; and what he did to Dathan and Abiron,
                 the sons of Eliab, son of Reuben, whom the earth, opening
                 its    mouth, swallowed up, with their houses, and their tents,
                 and all their substance with them, in the midst of all Israel.
              7 Because your eyes have seen all these great acts of the Lord
             8 which he hath done among you ; therefore you shall keep all
                  his commandments which I this day give thee in charge, that
                  you may live, and multiply, and go in, and possess that land to
                  which you are going to cross the Jordan, there to take posses-
              9 sion of itâ€”that you may prolong your days in that land, which
                  the Lord, with an oath to your fathers, promised to give to
                  them, and to their seed after themâ€”a land flowing with milk
            10 and honey.                For the land to which you are going, to take pos-
                  session of it, is not like the land of Egypt, from which you
                  came out, where, when they have sown the seed, they can
            11 water it with their feet, like a garden of herbs.                                     But the land to
                  which you are going, to take possession of it, is a land of hills
                  and dales, which drinketh up water from the rain of heaven
            12 a land over which the Lord thy God keepeth a continual
                  watch.        The eyes of the Lord thy God are upon it, from the
            13 beginning of the year to the end thereof.                                           And if you will
                  hearken diligently to all the commands which I this day com-
                  mand thee, to love the Lord thy God, and to serve him with
                  thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, he will give rain
            14 for thy land in due seasonâ€”the former and the latter rain
                                                                                                                               ;
                  and thou shalt gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.
            15 He will also give grass in thy fields for thy cattle.
            16          But when thou hast eaten, and art full, take heed to thyself
     Ch. XL                 DEUTERONOMY.
        that thy heart be not elated ; and that you do not transgress,
     17 and serve other gods, and worship them, lest the Lord, being
        provoked to wrath against you, shut up heaven, so that there
        shall be no rain, and the land yield not its products, and ye
        quickly perish from that good land, which the Lord hath given
     18 you.  Therefore lay up these things in your heart, and in your
        soul, and bind them for a sign on your hand, that they may be
     19 immoveably before your eyes.    And you shall teach them to
        your children, by speaking of them, when thou sittest at home,
        and when thou walkest abroad, and when thou liest down to
     20 sleep, and when thou risest up.  And you shall write them on
     21 the door posts of your houses, and of your gates ; that you
        may prolong your lives, that the days of your children in the
        land which the Lord solemnly promised your fathers to give
     22 them, may be as the days of heaven over the earth. For it shall
        come to pass, that if you hearken diligently to all these com-
        mands, which I this day enjoin you to doâ€”to love the Lord
     23 our God, and to walk in all his ways, and to cleave to him, the
        Lord will drive out all those nations from before you, and you
        shall possess nations much greater and stronger than you.
     24 Every place on which you shall imprint the track of your feet
        shall; be yours, from the wilderness to Antilibanus, and from
     25 the river, the great river Euphrates, to the western sea.These
        shall be your boundaries.  None shall be able to stand before
        you.  For the Lord your God will impress the fear of you, and
        the dread of you, on the face of all the land on which you shall
        tread, as the Lord hath said to you.
     26    Behold I am going to lay before you this day the blessing
     27 and the curseâ€”the^blessing, if you will hearken to the com-
        mandments of the Lord your God, which I thistday command
     28 youâ€”and the curse, if you will not hearken to the command-
        ments of the Lord our God, in all respects, as I this day com-
        mand you ; but turn aside out of the way to which I have en-
        joined you, and go to serve other gods, which you do not
     29 know.   And when the Lord thy God hath brought thee to the
        land, to which thou art going to cross over, there to take pos-
        session of it, thou shalt put the blessing on mount Garazin,
     o0 and the curse on mount Gaibal.    Behold are not these on the
        bank of the Jordan, behind the road to the setting of the sun,
       Ch. XII.                DEUTERONOMY.
           in the land of the Chananites, whose dwelling is to the west-
           ward, adjoining Golgol, near the lofty oak ?  for you are going
           to cross the Jordan.
       31     When you have gone in, to possess the land which the
           Lord our God giveth you for a perpetual possession, and you
           shall dwell therein, be careful to perform all his command-
          ments, and all these judgments, which I this day lay before you.
       XII.     Now these are the commandments, and the judgments,
          which you shall be careful to execute, in the land which the
          Lord the God of your fathers giveth you for a possession, all
          the days you live in the land.
        2     You shall utterly destroy all those places, in which they
          whom you succeed, have worshipped their gods, on the lofty
        3 mountains, and on the hills, and under every shady tree.     You
          shall level their mounts, and break in pieces their pillars, and
          cut down their groves, and burn the graven images of their
          gods with fire, so that their name may be destroyed out of
          that place.
        4     You shall not do to the Lord your God, in the manner they
        5 have done ; but you shall seek out and come to the place,
          which the Lord thy God shall make choice of, in one of your
        6 cities, to put his name there, and to be invoked ; and to that
          place you shall bring your whole burnt offerings, and your sa-
          crifices, and your oblations, and your vows, and your free will
          offerings, and your thank offerings, and the firstlings of your
          herds, and flocks ; and you shall eat there before the Lord your
        7 God, and rejoice with your households, for all your possessions,
          and the labours of your hands, as the Lord thy God hath blessed
        8 thee.  You shall not do all that we do here at this day ; every
        9 one what is agreeable in his own sight ; for till now you have
          not come to the rest, and to the inheritance which the Lord
       10 your God giveth you : but when you cross the Jordan, and
          dwell in the land which the Lord our God giveth you for a
          possessionâ€”when he shall give you rest from all your enemies
          round about, and you shall dwell in safety, then there shall be
       11a place, wherever the Lord thy God shall chuse, for his name
          to be invoked.  To that place you shall bring all that I this day
          command you, your whole burnt offerings, and your sacrifices,
          and your tenths, and the oblations of your hands, and the choice
          XII.                DEUTEKONOMY.
     Ch.
     12 of all your gifts which you may vow to the Lord your G-od ; and
        you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you, and your
        sons, and your daughters, and your men servants, and your
        maid servants, and the Levite who is at your gates, because he
     13 hath no portion nor inheritance with you.        Take heed to thy-
        self, that thou offer not thy whole burnt offerings in every place
     14 which thou mayst see ; but only in the place which the Lord
        thy God shall make choice of, in one of thy tribes.      There you
        shall offer your whole burnt offerings, and there you shall do
     15 all that I this day command you.       Nevertheless, to satisfy thy
        desire, thou mayst kill and eat flesh, in every city, according
        to the blessing of the Lord thy God, which he hath given thee.
        The unclean with thee, and the clean, may eat it together, as
        you now do a roebuck or a deer ; but you must not eat the
     16 blood : that you shall pour on the ground like water.          Thou
     17 shall not be at liberty to eat, in thy cities, the tythe of thy corn,
        and of thy wine, and thine oil, nor the firstlings of thy herds,
        and thy flocks, nor any of thy vows, which you shall make, nor
     18 your thank offerings, nor the oblations of thy hands.         These
        thou shalt eat no where but before the Lord, in the place which
        the Lord thy God shall chuse for himself; thou, and thy son,
        and thy daughter, thy man servant, and thy maid servant, and
     19 the stranger who is in thy cities.    And when thou shalt rejoice
        before the Lord thy God, for all thy possessions and all the
        labours of thy hand, take heed to thyself, that thou neglect not
     20 the Levite, as long as thou livest in the land.      And when the
        Lord thy God hath enlarged thy borders, as he hath said to
        thee, if thou shalt say, I will eat flesh ; if thy soul desireth to
        eat flesh ; thou mayst, to satisfy the longing of thy soul, eat
     21 flesh : and if the place, which the Lord thy God may have cho-
        sen for his name to be invoked, be far from thee, thou mayst
        slay, in the manner I have commanded thee, some of thy herd
        or thy flock, which God hath given thee, and eat in thy cities,
     22 according to the longing of thy soul.      As the roebuck and the
         deer is eaten so thou shalt eat it.   The unclean and the clean
     23 may alike eat it.    But be very cautious not to eat blood.      For
     24 his blood is life.   Life must not be eaten with the flesh.     You
     25 must not eat it.   You must pour it out on the ground, like wa-
         ter.  Thou shalt not eat it, that it may be well with thee, and
       Ch. XIII.                  DEUTERONOMY.
       26 thy children after thee.      If thou wouldst do what is good, and
           well pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God, over and above
           thy hallowed things, if any thou hast ; thou shalt take thy vows,
           and come to the place which the Lord thy God may have cho-
       27 sen for his name to be there invoked, and having offered thy
           whole burnt offerings, thou shalt offer up the flesh at the altar
           of the Lord thy God, and pour out the blood of thy own sacri-
           fices against the base of the altar of the Lord thy God, and eat
           the flesh of these.
       28      Observe and hear, that thou mayst do all the things which
           I command thee, that it may be well with thee, and with thy
           children after thee for ever.
       29      When thou hast done what is well pleasing and good in the
           sight of the Lord thy God ; and when the Lord thy God shall
           have driven out from before thee the nations, to which thou
       30 art going, to take possession of their land, and thou shalt pos-
           sess it, and dwell therein, take heed to thyself that thou seek
           not to follow them after they are driven out from before thee,
           saying, How did these nations sacrifice to their gods ? I will sa-
       31 crifice in like manner.      Thou shalt not do so to thy God ; for
           they sacrificed to their gods the abominations of the Lord, which
           he hated ; for they burned their sons, and their daughters, with
           fire, to their gods.
       32      Be careful to do every thing which I this day command
       XIII.      you.    Thou shalt not add to it, nor diminish from it.     If a
           prophet should start up among you, or a dreamer of dreams,
        2 and give thee a sign or a wonder ; and the sign or the wonder
           should come to pass, which he mentioned to thee saying, Let
        3 us go and worship other gods which you do not know ; you
           shall not hearken to the words of that prophet, or of that dream-
           er of dreams ; for the Lord thy God trieth you, to know whe-
           ther you love your God with your whole heart, and with your
        4 whole soul.     You shall follow the Lord your God, and fear him,
        5 and hearken to his voice, and cleave to him.        And that prophet,
           or that dreamer, shall be put to death ; for he hath spoken to
           lead thee astray from the Lord thy God, who brought thee out
           of the land of Egypt, who redeemed thee from bondageâ€”to
           put thee out of the way in which the Lord thy God commanded
        6 thee to walk.     So thou shalt remove evil from among you.        And
     Ch. XIV.                  DEUTERONOMY.
         if thy brother, the son of thy father, or of thy mother, or thine
         own son, or daughter, or the wife in thy bosom, or a friend
         who is as thine own soul, speak privately to thee saying, Let us
      7 go and serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers
         have knownâ€”any of the gods of the nations around you, of
         those near thee, or those far distant from thee, from one end
      8 of the earth to the other ; thou shalt not consent, nor hearken to
         him ; neither shall thine eye pity him, nor shalt thou spare him,
      9 nor conceal him.     Thou shalt surely inform against him, and
         thy hands shall be upon him, among the foremost, to kill him,
     10 and afterwards the hands of the whole people.       And they shall
         stone him with stones, and he shall be put to death, because
         he sought to make thee apostatise from the Lord thy God, who
         brought thee out of the land of Egyptâ€”out of the house of
     11 bondage.    So all Israel will hear, and be afraid, and no more
     12 proceed to do any such wickedness as this among you.            And
         if thou shalt hear it said, that in one of the cities, which the
     13 Lord thy God giveth thee to dwell in, there are wicked men
         gone forth among you, who have seduced all the inhabitants of
         their land, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you
     14 know not ; thou shalt examine, and make inquiry, and search
         diligently : And behold, if the report is evidently true, and
     15 such abomination hath been committed among you ; thou shalt
         surely destroy all the inhabitants of that land, with the slaugh-
         ter of the sword.   With an Anathema thou shalt devote to de-
     16 struction, it and all that are in it. Andthou shalt collect all the
         spoils of it into the streets thereof, and burn with fire the city,
         and all the spoils thereof, with all the inhabitants, in the sight
     17 of the Lord thy God.     And it shall be uninhabited for ever.    It
         shall never be rebuilt any more ; nor shall any thing of what is
         devoted to destruction cleave to thy hand, that the Lord may
         turn from the fierceness of his wrath, and shew thee mercy,
         and have compassion on thee, and multiply thee, in the man-
     18 ner he solemnly promised thy fathers, if thou wilt hearken to
         the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments
         which I this day command youâ€”to do what is comely and well
         pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God.
     XIV.       You are the children of the Lord your God ; you shall
         not make a baldness between your eyes for the dead.

       Ch. XIV.              DEUTERONOMY.
        2    Because thou art a people dedicated to the Lord thy God,
          and the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people
          to himself, above all the nations on the face of the earth, you shall
        3 not eat any abomination. These are the beasts which you shall
        4 eat, young beeves, and sheep, and goats, deer and roebucks, and
        5 the pygarg, and oryx, and camelopardalâ€”every beast which
        6 parteth the hoof, dividing it into two distinct hoofs, and which
        7 cheweth the cud ; these among the cattle you may eat. But of
          those which chew the cud, and of those which part not the hoof,
         dividing it into two distinct hoofs, these you shall not eatâ€”the
          camel, and the hairy foot, and the choirogryllus.Because though
          they chew the cud they do not part the hoof, they are unclean
       8 to youâ€”the swine also, because, though it parteth the hoof
         and divideth it into distinct hoofs, yet it doth not chew the
          cud, it is unclean to you.You shall not eat their flesh, nor
       9 touch their dead carcasses. And of all that are in the water,
          these you may eat. You may eat all that have fins and scales.
      10 But all that have not fins and scales, you shall not eat ; they are
      11 unclean to you.  Every clean fowl you may eat ; now these are
          they which you shall not eatâ€”the eagle and the ospray, and
         the cormorant, and the vulture, and the kite, and all of its spe-
         cies ; the ostrich, and the owl, and the gull, and the heron, and
         the swan, and the ibis, and cataractes, and the hawk, and all
         of its species ; and the puet, and the night hawk, and the pe-
         lican, and the charadrius, and all of its species ; and the por-
      19 phurion, and the bat. All the creeping things which fly are un-
      20 clean to you.  You shall not eat any of them.   Every flying
      21 thing, which is clean, you may eat. Every thing which dieth
         of itself you shall not eat.It may be given to the stranger,
         who is in thy cities, and he may eat it, or thou mayst sell it to
          the stranger.
             Because thou art a people dedicated to the Lord thy God,
          thou shalt not boil a lamb in the milk of its dam.
      22     Thou shalt set apart the tenth of all the increase of thy
      23 seed, the product of thy field year after year ; and this thou
         shalt eat in the place which the Lord thy God shall chuse, for
         his name to be there invoked.    Thither you shall bring the
         tenths of thy corn, and of thy wine, and thine oil and the first-
         lings of thy kine, and of thy flocks, that thou mayst learn to

     Ck.
     24 fear the Lord thy God always.      But if the way be too long for
         thee, and thou canst not carry them up, because the place is
         far distant from thee, which the Lord thy God hath chosen for
     25 his name to be there invoked ; seeing the Lord thy God hath
         blessed thee, therefore thou shalt sell them for money ; and
         thou shalt take the money in thy hand, and go to the place
     26 which the Lord thy God hath chosen ; and thou shalt give this
         money for whatever thy soul may desireâ€”for cattle, or for sheep,
         or for wine, or strong drink, or for any thing which thy soul
         may desire ; and thou shalt eat there before the Lord thy God,
     27 and rejoice with thy household, and the Levite who is in thy
     28 cities, because he hath no portion nor lot with you.      And, at
         the end of three years, thou shalt carry out all the tenth of thy
         products in that year, and lay it up in thy cities, and the Le-
         vite shall come, because he hath no portion nor lot with thee,
         and the proselyte, and the orphan, and the widow, who is in thy
         cities, and they shall eat and be filled, that the Lord thy God
         may bless thee in all the works which thou dost.
     XV.      Every seven years thou shalt make a release.       And this
       2 is the ordinance touching this release.   Thou shalt remit every
         private debt which thy neighbour oweth thee, and shalt not
         demand it of thy brother ; for the release for the Lord thy
       3 God is proclaimed.    Of a stranger thou mayst demand what
         may be due to thee from him ; but to a brother thou shalt
         make a release of what he oweth thee, because among you
      4 there is to be none in want; because the Lord thy God will,
         with blessing, bless thee iu the land which the Lord thy God
       5 giveth thee for an inheritance, that you may possess it, if you
         will but hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to keep,
         and perform, all these commandments which I this day com-
       6 mand you.    Because the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in the
         manner he promised thee, therefore thou shalt lend to many
         nations and shalt not borrow, and thou shalt rule over many
       7 nations, and they shall not rule over thee.  If then there chance
         to be among you a needy personâ€”one of thy brethren, in one
         of thy cities in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee
         thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy
       8 brother who is in want.    Thou shalt open thy hands liberally
         to him, and lend him what he is in want of, according to his
                                                                                                                  ;

           9 necessity.          Take heed to thyself that there be not a lurking
              thought in thy heartâ€”a wicked suggestion, saying, The se-
              venth year, the year of remission is near at hand.                                  When thou
              shalt look with an evil eye at thy brother who is in want, and
              not give hirn, he will cry to the Lord against thee, and it will
         10 be a great sin in thee.                    Thou shalt surely give him, and lend
              him freely, what he is in want of, according to his necessity.
              And thou shalt not be grieved at heart when thou givest to
              him ; for on this account the Lord thy God will bless thee in
         11 all thy works, and in all the labours of thy hands.                                 Because thy
              land may never be without some indigent person in it, there-
              fore I give thee a charge to do this thing, saying, Thou shalt
              open thy hands liberally to thy brother who is in want, and to
         12 the needy in thy land.                     And if thy brother, a Hebrew man, or
              a Hebrew woman, be sold to thee, he shall serve thee six years
              and on the seventh thou shalt send him away from thee, free.
         13 And when thou shalt send him away free from thee, thou shalt
         14 not send him away empty.                         Thou shalt furnish him liberally
              with provision for the journey, from thy flock and from thy
              corn, and thy wine.               According as the Lord thy God hath bless-
         15 ed thee, thou shalt give him; and remember that thou wast a
              servant in the land of Egypt, and that thence the Lord thy
              God redeemed thee; therefore I command thee to do this
         16 thing.         And if he shall say to thee, I will not go away from
              thee, because he hath loved thee, and thy family, and is well
         17 with thee ; then thou shalt take an awl, and bore his ear against
              the door, and he shall be thy servant forever.                             And in the same
         18 manner thou shalt treat thy maid servant.                                  It shall not seem
              hard to thee that they are let go free from thee ; for they have
              saved thee the wages of an hireling.                              He hath served thee
              six years.
         19         When the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all thou
              doest, every firstling of thy herds, and thy flocks, even all the
        20 males, thou shalt dedicate to the Lord thy God.                                       Thou shalt
              not work a firstling bull, nor shear the firstlings of thy flock.
              Thou shalt eat them before the Lord, year after year, in the
              place which the Lord thy God shall chuse, thou and thy house-
        21 hold.         But if any hath a blemish in itâ€”if it be lame, or blind,
              or any way blemished, thou shalt not sacrifice it to the Lord
                                                                 â€”
    Ch. XVI.              DEUTERONOMY.
    22 thy God.   In thy cities thou mayst eat itâ€”the unclean with
       thee as well as the clean may eat it, like the roebuck or deer.
    23 But the blood you shall not eat. Thou shalt pour out that on
       the ground, like water.
    XVI.     Observe the month of New things, and keep the pass-
       over to the Lord thy God, because in the month of New
       things thou didst come out of the land of Egypt, by night.
     2 And at the passover thou shalt sacrifice to the Lord thy God,
       sheep, and kine, in the place which the Lord thy God shall
     3 chuse for his name to be there invoked.  At it thou shalt not
       eat leaven. Seven days, at it, thou shalt eat unleavened bread
       the bread of affliction, because you came in haste out of Egypt,
       that you may remember the day of your coming out of the
     4 land of Egypt, all the days of your life.No leaven shall be
       seen in all thy borders for seven days, and none of the flesh
       of that which you shall sacrifice on the evening of the first day
     5 shall be left till the morning.Thou shalt not be at liberty to
       keep the passover in any of the cities which the Lord thy God
     6 giveth thee, but only in the place which the Lord thy God
       shall chuse, for his name to be there invoked.Thou shalt kill
       the passover in the evening, at the setting of the sun, in the
     7 season thou didst come out of Egypt.   And when thou hast
      cooked, and roasted, and eaten it, in the place which the Lord
       thy God hath chosen, in the morning thou mayst return and
    8 go home.   Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread ; and on
       the seventh day shall be the Exodâ€”a festival to the Lord thy
      God.   On it thou shalt not do any work, but what is necessary
      for life.
    9     Seven weeks thou                         â€”from thy first
                            shalt number for thyself
      beginning to put the sickle to the harvest thou shalt begin to
   10 number the seven weeks.   And thou shalt keep the festival of
      weeks, to the Lord thy God, according to the ability of thy
      handâ€”according to what the Lord thy God may have given
   11 thee.  And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, thou,
      and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man servant, and thy maid
      servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and
      the widow who is among you, in the place which the Lord
   12 thy God shall chuse for his name to be there invoked.   And
      thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of
        Ch. XVII.                 DEUTERONOMY.
           Egypt ; therefore thou shalt keep, and perform, these com-
           mandments.
        13     The feast of tabernacles thou shalt keep for thyself seven
        14 days.   When thou hast gathered in from thy threshing floor,
           and from thy press, thou shalt rejoice at this thy festival, thou
           and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man servant, and thy maid
           servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and
        15 the widow, who is in thy cities.      Seven days thou shalt cele-
           brate this festival to the Lord thy God, in the place which the
           Lord thy God hath chosen for himself.        So when the Lord thy
        16 God shall bless thee in all thy productions, and in all the works
           of thy hands, and thou shalt be made glad, every male shall,
           three times in the year, appear before the Lord thy God, in the
           place which the Lord shall chuseâ€”at the festival of unleaven-
           ed bread, and at the festival of weeks, and at the festival of ta-
           bernacles.   Thou shalt not appear before the Lord thy God
        17 empty handed.      Every one of you shall bring according to the
            ability of his hand, according to the blessing of the Lord thy
           God, which he hath given thee.
        18     Thou shalt appoint for thyself judges, and promulgators of
           the law, in the cities which the Lord thy God giveth thee,
           in every tribe.   And they shall administer just judgment to the
        19 people.   They shall not wrest judgment, nor respect persons,
           nor shall they receive a gift.     For gifts blind the eyes of the
        20 wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.       Thou shalt pur-
           sue righteously what is right, that you may live, and go in, and
           possess the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
        21     Thou shalt not plant a grove for thyself, nor make for thy-
            self a wood near the altar of thy God, nor set up for thyself a
           pillar : these are things which the Lord thy God hateth.
        XVII.       Thou shalt not sacrifice to the Lord thy God a young
           bull, or a sheep, in which there is a blemishâ€”any defect ; for
            it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
         2      If there be found in any of thy cities which the Lord thy
            God giveth thee, a man, or a woman, who shall do evil in the
           sight of the Lord thy God, to transgress his covenant, and they
            have gone, and served other gods, and worshipped them,
         3 either the sun, or the moon, or any of the whole host of heaven,
         4 which he hath not commanded thee, and information be given
                            DEUTERONOMY.
    Ch. XVII.
       thee, and thou hast made strict inquiry, and behold the thing
     5 hath been actually done, and such an abomination hath been
       committed in Israel, thou shalt bring out that man, or that
       woman, and you shall stone them with stones, till they die.
     6 On the testimony of two or three witnesses the guilty person
       shall be put to death ; but shall not be put to death on the
    7 testimony of one witness.   And the hand of the witness shall
       be upon him, among the first, to put him to death, and after-
       wards the hands of the people.  So thou shalt remove the wick-
       edness from among you.
    8     And if any cause which requireth judicial decisionâ€”an ac-
       tion of murder, an action of appeal, a case of leprosy, an action
    9 of plaint and denialâ€”any causes which require decision in any
       of your cities, be too difficult for thee, thou shalt arise, and go
       up to the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen, and
       there come to the priests, the Levites, or to the judge, who-
   10 ever he may be in those days, and they shall inquire, and de-
       clare to thee the sentence of judgment, and thou shalt act ac-
       cording to what they declare to thee from the place which the
       Lord thy God hath chosen : and thou shalt be careful to do
   11 according to what is expounded to thee for law.    According to
       the law, and according to the sentence of judgment, which
       they tell thee, thou shalt do.Thou shalt not deviate from what
    12 they tell thee, either to the right, or to the left. And if any man
       act presumptuously, so as not to hearken to the priest who
       hath stood to minister to the name of the Lord thy God ; or to
       the judge who may be in those days ; that man shall be put to
    13 death.  So thou shalt remove the evil person from among Is-
       rael, and all the people, when they hear, will be struck with
       awe, and no more act presumptuously.
    14    And when thou art come to the land which the Lord thy
       God giveth thee, and hast taken possession of it, and dwelt
       therein, if thou shouldst say, I will set a chief over me, as the
    15 other nations around me do; thou shalt surely set, as chief over
       thee, him whom the Lord thy God shall chuse.    Thou shalt ap-
       point one of thy brethren chief over thee.     Thou shalt not
       be at liberty to set a stranger over thee, because he is not thy
    1G brother. Because he is not to multiply cavalry for himself, he must
       not even cause his people to go back to Egypt ; in order that
            XVIII.            DEUTERONOMY.
       Ch.
           he may not multiply his cavalry : the Lord indeed hath said,
        17 You shall not henceforth return that way any more.   Neither
           shall he multiply wives to himself ; that his heart may not turn
           aside ; nor shall he greatly multiply for himself silver and gold.
       18 And when he is settled in his government, he shall write for him-
           self this repetition of the law in a book, from that which is in
       19 the custody of the priests, the Levites. And he shall keep it
           by him, and shall read therein all the days of his life, that he
           may learn to fear the Lord thy God, and to keep all these com-
       20 mandments, and execute all these judgments ; that his heart
           may not be lifted up above his brethrenâ€”that he may not turn
           aside from these commandments, to the right, or to the left, to
           the end that he and his sons may long enjoy his government
           among the children of Israel.
       XVIII.      The priests, the Levites, even the whole tribe of Levi,
           shall have no portion, nor lot, with Israel.The homage offer-
         2 ings of the Lord are their lot.Them they shall eat ; and they
           shall not have a lot of inheritance among their brethren,The
           Lord himself is their lot of inheritance, as he hath said to them.
         3 Now this shall be the priest's due from the peopleâ€”from them
           who offer sacrifices, whether a young bull, or a sheep, thou
           shalt give to the priest the shoulder, and the cheeks, and the
        4 maw.    Thou shalt also give him the dedications of thy corn,
           and thy wine, and thine oil, and the dedications of the fleeces
        5 of thy flock. Because the Lord hath chosen him, out of all thy
           tribes, to stand before the Lord God, to minister and to bless,
        6 in his name ; therefore with regard to him and his sons, among
           the children of Israel, if, out of any one of all these cities of
           the children of Israel where he dwelleth, a Levite cometh, with
        7 all the desire of his soul, to the place which the Lord hath cho-
           sen, that he may minister to the name of the Lord his God, as
        8 all his brethren the Levites do, who attend there before the
           Lord thy God, he shall eat the allotted portion, over and above
           what may come from the sale of his patrimony.
        9     When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy
           God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abomina-
       10 tions of those nations. Let there not be found among you any one
           who purifieth his son, or his daughter, with fire ; or who prac-
           tiseth divinations, or consulteth omens, or augury, or maketh
          XIX.                 DEUTERONOMY.
     Ch.
     11 use of drugs to practise incantation, or a belly speaker, or an
     12 astrologer, or a necromancer ; for every one who practiseth
         such things is an abomination to the Lord thy God ; for, be-
         cause of these abominations, the Lord will root them out from
     13 before you.     Thou shalt be complete in the sight of the Lord
     14 thy God.     For these nations which thou art about to possess
         will hearken to enchanters and diviners ; but the Lord thy God
     15 hath not permitted thee to do so.      The Lord thy God will raise
         up for thee, from among thy brethren, a prophet like me ; to
     1(1 him you shall hearken.     According to all that thou didst request
         of the Lord thy God at Choreb, in the day of the solemn as-
         sembly, when you said, Let us no more hear the voice of the
         Lord thy God, and let us no more behold this great fire, lest
     17 we die, the Lord then said to me, They have spoken right in
     18 all that they have said to thee : I will raise up for them, from
         among their brethren, a prophet like thee, and I will put my
         words in his mouth, and he will speak to them as I command
     19 him : and whosoever will not hearken to what that prophet
         shall speak in my name, I will execute vengeance on him.
     20 But the prophet who shall wickedly presume to speak a word
        in my name which I have not commanded him to speak, or
        who shall speak in the name of other gods, that prophet shall
     21 be put to death.    Now if thou shalt say in thy heart, How shall
     22 I know the word which the Lord hath not spoken ?           When the
        things which that prophet hath spoken in the name of the Lord
        shall not happen, nor come to pass, the Lord hath not spoken
        that word.    The prophet hath spoken wickedly.        You shall not
        spare him.
     XIX.       Now when the Lord thy God hath destroyed the nati-
        ons, whose land thy God giveth thee, and you have taken pos-
      2 session of it, and dwelt in their cities, and in their houses,
        thou shalt set apart for thyself three cities, in the midst of
      3 that thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.               Make
        straight the way for thee, and divide into three districts, the
        bounds of thy land which the Lord thy God parcelleth out to
        thee : and in each district let there be a place of refuge for the
      4 slayer.   And this shall be the ordinance for every slayer who
        may flee thither, and live.      Whosoever shall smite his neigh-
      5 bour unawares, and hated him not in times past, for instance
            VOL. I.                     t t
         Oh XIX.                  DEUTERONOMY.
            whosoever shall go with his neighbour into the forest to col-
            lect wood, and the hand of him who is cutting the wood with
            an axe being drawn back, the iron shall slip from the helve, and
            accidentally fall on his neighbour, and he die ; such a one shall
         6 flee with speed to one of the cities, and live.     Lest the avenger
            of blood pursuing, because his heart is inflamed, should over-
            take him, if the way be too long, and slay him, though he is
         7 not guilty of death, because he hated him not in time past ; for
            this cause I give thee this charge, saying, Thou shalt set apart
         8 three cities for thyself.   And when the Lord thy God shall en-
           large thy borders, as he hath sworn to thy fathers, and the
           Lord hath given thee all the land which he promised to give
         9 thy fathers, if thou wilt hearken to do all the commands which
           I this day give thee in charge, to love the Lord thy God, to
        1  walk in all his ways continually ; thou shalt add three cities
           more for thyself, besides these three, so that guiltless blood
           may not be shed in the land which the Lord thy God giveth
        11 thee for a possession.    But there must not be among you one
           guilty of blood.    If therefore there be among you a man who
           hateth his neighbour, and who shall lie in wait for him, and
           rise up against him, and smite him so that he die, and flee to
       12 one of these cities ; the senate of his city shall send and take
           him thence, and deliver him into the hands of the avenger of
       13 blood, and he shall be put to death.       Thine eye shall not spare
           him.   So shalt thou purge away guiltless blood from Israel, and
       14 it shall be well with thee.       Thou shalt not remove the boun-
           daries of thy neighbour, which thy fathers have settled at the
           distribution of the inheritances, which were given thee to pos-
           sess in the land, which the Lord thy God hath given thee by lot.
       15       One witness shall not be sufficient to testify against a man
           for any iniquity, or any crime, or any sin, which he may com-
           mit.   By the mouth of two witnesses, or by the mouth of three
       16 witnesses, every thing shall be established.      And if a false wit-
           ness rise up against a man, and accuse him of any crime, the
       17 two men between whom is the controversy, shall stand before
           the Lord, and before the priests, and before the judges, who
       18 may be in those days.      And when the judges have made a strict
           examination, if the false witness hath testified falsehoods, and
       19 risen up against his brother ; you shall do to him as he wicked-
                                                                                                                         ;

              ]y thought to do to his brother.                         80 thou shalt remove the evil
              from among you ; and the rest, when they hear, will be afraid,
              and thenceforth proceed no more to commit such evil among
        20 you.          Thine eye shall not pity him ; life for life ; eye for eye
              tooth for tooth ; hand for hand ; foot for foot.
        XX.            When thou shalt go out to battle against thine enemies,
             and see horsemen, and charioteers, and a people more nume-
             rous than thou art ; be not afraid of them ; for the Lord thy
             God is with theeâ€”he who brought thee up out of the land of
         2 Egypt.            And when thou art near coming to battle, the priest
         3 shall approach, and speak to the people, and say to them, Hear,
             O Israel !          Yon are now going to battle against your enemies ;
             let not your heart be discouraged ; fear not, nor be dismayed,
         4 nor turn aside from before them ; for the Lord your God go-
             eth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, and to
         5 save you.            Then the scribes shall speak to the people, and say,
             If there be any man who hath built a new house, and hath not
             dedicated it, let him go, and return to his house, lest he die in
         6 the battle, and another man dedicate it.                                   Or is there any man
             who hath planted a vineyard, and hath not been regaled with
             it ;  let him go, and return to his family, lest he die in the bat-
         7 tie, and another man be regaled with it.                                   Or is there any man
             who hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her home ; let
            him go, and return to his family, lest he die in the battle, and
        8 another man take her.                        And the scribes shall further speak to

            let him go, and return to his family, lest he make the heart of
        9 his brother faint as his own.                         And when the scribes have done
            speaking to the people, they shall appoint the chiefs of the ar-
      10 my to lead on the people.                           And when thou art come to a city,
            to fight against it, thou shalt call upon the inhabitants to come
      11 out peaceably.                 And if they return thee a peaceful answer, and
            open to thee ; all the people who are found therein shall be tri-
      12 butary to thee, and be thy subjects.                              But if they hearken not to
      13 thee, and make war against thee, thou shalt besiege it, until
      14 the Lord thy God deliver it into thy hands.                                         And when thou
            hast smitten all the males therein with the slaughter of the sword,
            thou shalt take for thyself, besides the women and the children,
            all the cattle, and all spoils that are in the city, and eat all the
                                                                                                                   ;;

          15 prey of thine enemies, which the Lord thy God giveth thee.                                         In
                this manner thou shalt treat all the cities which are at a great
          16 distance from thee, which are not of the cities of those nations
           17 whose land the Lord thy God giveth thee for a possession.                                         Of
                these you shall save none alive that breatheth : but, with an
                Anathema, thou shalt devote to destruction the Chettite and
                the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the
                Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Gergasite, as the Lord thy
          18 God hath commanded thee ; that they may not teach you all
               their abominations which they have performed to their gods
          19 and that you may not sin before the Lord your God : Now
               when thou shalt sit down before a city, many days, to war
               against it till it be taken, thou shalt not destroy the trees there-
               of by striking an ax against them.                          That especially, the fruit
                of which thou mayst eat, thou shalt not cut down.                                    Doth any
               man wish to have a tree in the field for the purpose of a rarn-
          20 part for thee ; let it be that only which thou knowest is not a
               fruit bearing tree.              This thou mayst destroy and cut down, to
               build ramparts against the city which resisteth thee, until it be
               delivered up.
          XXI.            If one be found slain in the land which the Lord thy
            2 God giveth thee to possessâ€”lying in the open field ; and it is
                not known who smote him ; thy senate, and thy judges, shall
               come and measure the distance to the cities around the slain
            3 and the senate of the city which is next to the slain, shall take
               a heifer from the herd, which hath never been worked, and
            4 which hath never drawn in a yoke ; and the senate of the city
               shall bring the heifer down to a rugged valley, which hath never
               been tilled, nor sowed, and they shall hamstring the heifer
            5 in the valley.             Then the priests, the Levites, shall come near :
                because the Lord God hath chosen them to wait upon him, and
                to bless in his name, therefore by their mouth every cause of
                plaint and denial, as well as all cases of leprosy, are to be de-
            6 cided ; and the whole senate of the city which is nearest the
                person dead, shall wash their hands over the head of the heifer,
            7 which was hamstringed in the valley, and shall answer, and say,
                Our hands have not shed this blood, and our eyes have not
            8 seen it.         Be merciful to thy people whom thou,                                 Lord, hast
                redeemed, that there may not be blood shed without cause
    Ch. XXI.                 DEUTEKONOMY.
     9 among thy people Israel.    So the blood shall be forgiven them,
        and thou shalt remove from among you the blood which was
        shed without cause, if thou do what is good, and well pleasing
        in the sight of the Lord thy God.
    10     And when thou goest out to war against thine enemies, and
    11 the Lord thy God hath delivered them into thy hands, and thou
        hast taken their prey, and hast seen, among the captives, a wo-
    12 man of a comely appearance, and hast loved her, and hast ta-
        ken her to thyself for a wife, and brought her home to thy house,
    13 thou shalt shave her head, and pare her nails, and take from
        her the garments of her captivity, and she shall remain in thy
        house, and bewail her father, and her mother, a full month,
        and after that thou mayst go in unto her, and cohabit with her,
    14 and she shall be thy wife.     And in case thou dislike her, thou
        shalt send her away free.    She shall not be sold for money.
        Thou shalt not deal falsely with her, because thou hast hum-
        bled her.
    15     If any man hath two wives, and one of them be beloved,
        and the other hated ; and both the beloved, and the hated, bear
    16 him children, and the son of the hated be the first born, he
        shall not be at liberty, when he bequeatheth his substance to
        his children, to give the right of primogeniture to the son of
        the beloved, and overlook the son of the hated, who is the first
    17 born ; but shall acknowledge the son of the hated as his first
        born, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath, be-
        cause he is the head of his children, and the rights of primo-
        geniture belong to him.
    18     If any man hath a stubborn, and rebellious son, who heark-
        eneth not to the voice of his father, nor to the voice of his mo-
        ther ; and they have corrected him, and he will not hearken to
    19 them ; his father and his mother shall take him, and bring him
    20 out to the senate of his city, and to the gate of the place ; and
        they shall say to the men of their city, This our son is stub-
        born and rebellious ; he hearkeneth not to our voice.   He is de-
     21 voted to revelling and drunkenness.    Thereupon the men of his
        city shall stone him with stones, and he shall be put to death.
        So thou shalt remove the wicked from among you ; and the
        rest, who hear, will be struck with awe.
     22      If any man commit a sin incurring death ; and he be put
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

                             remain on the gibbet ; but you shall bury it the same day.                                                                                                                   Be-

                             giveth thee for a possesion.
                   XXII.                           When thou seest thy brother's ox or sheep going astray,
                             thou must not overlook them.                                                                    Thou shalt surely bring them
                      2 back to thy brother, and restore them to him.                                                                                                And if thy bro-

                            take them home to thy house ; and they shall be with thee, until
                            thy brother seek them ; then thou shalt restore them to thy bro-
                      3 ther.                   In like manner thou shalt do with his ass, and in like
                            manner with his raiment, and in like manner with every thing
                            which thy brother hath lost.                                                           Whatever hath been lost by him,
                     4 if thou find it thou must not overlook it.                                                                                      When thou seest thy
                            brother's ass, or his ox, fallen in the way, thou must not over-
                            look them ; thou shalt help him to lift them up.
                     5                   A woman shall not wear what appertaineth to man, nor
                            shall a man put on a woman's garment ; for every one who
                            doth such things is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
                     6                If there chance to be before thee in the way, either in a tree,
                            or on the ground, a bird's nest, with young or eggs ; and the
                            dam be sitting on the young, or on the eggs ; thou shalt not
                     7 take the dam with the young.                                                                          Thou shalt let the dam go

                           but thou mayst take the young for thyself; that it may be well
                           with thee, and that thou mayst prolong thy days.
                     8               When thou buildest a new house, thou shalt make a bat-
                           tlement for thy roof, that thou mayst not occasion death by thy
                           house, by any one's falling from it.
                    9                Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard, when the product of it is
                           consecrated, with seed of another kind, that the seed which
                       â€¢   thou sowest may not be consecrated, with the product of thy
                           vineyard.
                 10                  Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together.
                 11                  Thou shalt not wear, without scouring, a garment of wool
                           and flax in the same piece.
                 12                  Thou shalt make bunches of ribbons on the four tufts of
                           the mantles with which thou clothest thyself.
                 13                  If any man take a wife, and cohabit with her, and hate her,
     Oh. XXII.                DEUTERONOMY.
     14 and spread groundless reports concerning her, and give her an
        ill name, and say, I took this woman to wife, but when I came
     15 to her, I did not find her tokens of virginity ; thereupon the
        father and mother of the damsel taking the tokens of their
        child's virginity, shall carry them to the senate, to the gate.
    16 And the father of the girl shall say to the senate, I gave this
        my daughter to that man for a wife ; but he now hateth her,
        and hath spread groundless reports concerning her, saying, I
    17 found not the tokens of virginity in thy daughter.         Now these
        are the proofs of my daughter's virginity.         And they shall
    18 spread the garment before the senate of the city.         Whereupon
        the senate of the city shall take the man, and chastise him, and
    19 fine him a hundred shekels, and give them to the father of the
        young woman, because he brought an ill name on a virgin of
        Israel ; and she shall be his wife.   He shall not be at liberty to
    20 put her away all his days.     But if his accusation be founded in
        truth, and proofs of virginity cannot be found for the young
    21 woman, they shall carry out the young woman to the doors of
        her father's house, and stone her with stones, till she die, be-
        cause she hath committed folly in Israel, by making her father's
        house a place of prostitution.    So thou shalt remove evil from
        among you.
    22      If a man be found lying with a woman who is married, you
        shall put them both to death ; both the man who lay with the
        woman, and the woman.       So shalt thou take away evil from Is-
        rael.
    23      If a virgin be betrothed to a husband ; and a man find her
        in a city, and lie with her, you shall bring them both out to the
    24 gate of the city, and stone them with stones, till they dieâ€”the
        young woman, because she did not cry aloud in the city, and
    25 the man because he humbled the wife of his neighbour.              So
        thou shalt remove evil from among you.       But if the man found
        the woman who was betrothed, in the field, and by force lay
        with her, you shall put him only to death who lay with her.
    26 The young woman is not guilty of death.            As when a man
        hath risen up against his neighbour, and killed him, even so is
    27 this matter : for he found her in the field.     The young woman
        who was betrothed, cried aloud, but there was none to help her.
    28      If any man find a young woman, who is not betrothed,
           XXIII.            DEUTERONOMY.
       Ch.
       29 and by force lie with her, and be found, the man who hath lain
          with her shall pay the father of the young woman fifty di-
          drachms of silver, and she shall be his wife : because he hath
          humbled her, he shall not be at liberty to put her away, all the
          days of his life.
       30    A man shall not take his father's wife, nor uncover his fa-

       XXIII.     A man who is made a eunuch by bruising, or by cut-
        2 ting, shall not come into the congregation of the Lord; nor
          shall the son of a harlot come into the congregation of the
        3 Lord.  An Amorite, and a Moabite, shall not come into the
          congregation of the Lord : even to the tenth generation, they
        4 shall not come into the congregation of the Lordâ€”nay ; even
          for ever ; because they did not meet you with bread and water
          on the way, when you were coming out of Egypt ; and be-
        5 cause they hired against thee, Balaam, son of Beor, of Meso-
          potamia, to curse thee ; but the Lord thy God would not
          hearken to Balaam.  Nay, the Lord thy God turned the curses
        6 into a blessing, because the Lord thy God loved thee.Thou
          shalt not propose terms of peace with them, nor what is condu-
        7 cive to their welfare, all thy days, forever.Thou shalt not
          abominate an Idumean; for he is thy brother.    Thou shalt
          not hold in abhorrence an Egyptian ; because thou wast a so-
        8 journer in his land.If either of these have sons, they may come
          into the congregation of the Lord, in the third generation.
        9     When thou goest out to encamp against thine enemies,
       10 thou shalt be on thy guard against every evil thing.If there
          be with thee a man who is unclean, by reason of any nightly
          pollution, he shall go out of the camp, or he shall not come
       11 into the camp ; but towards evening he shall wash his body
          with water, and when the sun is set, he may come into the
       12 camp.  Moreover thou shalt have a place without the camp,
       13 and thou shalt go out thither.And thou shalt have in thy gir-
          dle a spaddle, and when thou hast eased thyself abroad, thou
       14 shalt dig with it, and cover thy uncleanness.  Because the
          Lord thy God walketh about in thy camp, to save thee, and
          subdue thine enemy before thee, therefore thy camp must be
          holy. There must be nothing unseemly seen with thee, that
          he may not turn away from thee.
    Ch. XXIV.             DEUTERONOMY.
    15     Thou shalt not deliver up to his master, a servant who
    16 hath fled to thee, from his master.He shall dwell among you
        wherever he pleaseth.Thou shalt not afflict him.
    17     There shall not be a harlot of the daughters of Israel, nor
        a whoremonger of the sons of Israel.  There shall not be a
        prostitute among the daughters of Israel, nor shall any of the
       Israelites be a votary of prostitution.
    18     Thou shalt not bring the hire of an harlot, nor the price of
       a dog, into the house of the Lord, for any vow, for both are an
       abomination to the Lord thy God.
    19     Thou shalt not take interest of thy brother, for money,
       nor for victuals, nor for any thing which thou mayst lend him.
    20 To a stranger thou mayst lend on interest ; but to thy brother
       thou shalt not lend on interest ; that the Lord thy God may
       bless thee in all thy works, in the land to which thou art going
       to take possession of it.
    21     If thou vowest a vow to the Lord thy God, thou shalt not
       delay to pay it ; for the Lord thy God will surely require it of
    22 thee ; and it would be a sin in thee.If thou dost not chuse to
    23 make a vow, it is no sin in thee.Thou must be careful of what
       have proceeded from thy lips ; and offer, in the manner thou
       hast vowed to the Lord thy God, the gift which thou hast pro-
       mised with thy mouth.
    25     If thou comest into thy neighbour's field of standing corn,
       thou mayst gather ears with thy hands ; but thou shalt not put
       a sickle into thy neighbour's field of standing grain.And if
       thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, thou mayst eat
        grapes, till thy soul is satisfied, but thou shalt not put any into
        a vessel.
    XXIV.      If any one hath taken a wife, and cohabited with her,
       and it should happen that she hath not found favour in his
      2 sight, because he hath found something unseemly in her, he
       may write her a bill of divorce, and put it into her hands, and
     3 send her away from his house.And having gone away, she may
        become another man'swife.But if her last husband hate her, and
        write her a bill of divorce and put it in her handsand send her away
     4 from his house ; or if her last husband, who hath taken her to wife,
        die ;her former husband, who put her away, shall not be at
        liberty to return and take her again to wife ; for it is an abo-
           vol. I.                 u u
                                                                                                                                            :
             Ch. XXIV.                                     DEUTERONOMY.
                    mination to the Lord thy God; and you must not defile the
                    land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for a possession.
               5          If any man hath lately taken a wife, he shall not go out to
                    battle, nor shall he be charged with any business.                                                      He shall
                    be free at home one year, that he may cheer his wife whom he
                   hath taken.
               6          Thou shalt not take in pledge an upper, nor a lower mil-
                    stone, for this is taking a man's life in pledge.
               7          If any man be found stealing any of his brethren, the chil-
                   dren of Israel, or, having got him in his power, selleth him,
                   the thief shall be put to death.                               So shalt thou remove evil from
                   among you.
               8          Take heed to thyself, that in the touch of the leprosy thou
                   be very careful to act according to all the law which the priests,
                   the Levites, may point out to you.                                  Be careful to do in the man-
               9 ner I commanded you.                                Eemember what the Lord thy God
                   did to Mariam, on the way, as you were coming out of the
                   land of Egypt.
             10           If a debt of any kind be due to thee from thy neighbour,
             11 thou shalt not go into his house to take his pledge.                                                    Thou shalt
                   stand without, and the man who is thy debtor shall bring the
             12 pledge out to thee.                          And if the man be very poor, thou shalt
             13 not go to sleep with his pledge.                                    Thou shalt surely restore him
                   his pledge at the going down of the sun, that he may sleep in
                   his garment, and bless thee, and there shall be mercy for thee
                   in the sight of the Lord thy God.
             14           Thou shalt not withhold the wages of a poor and needy man,
                   whether he be one of thy brethren, or of the strangers who are
             15 in thy cities.                  Thou shalt pay him his wages on the very day
                   let not the sun set upon it.                            For he is poor, and dependeth on
                   it ;   and he will cry to the Lord against thee, and it will be a
                   sin in thee.
             16           Fathers shall not be put to death for children ; nor the
                   children for fathers.                     Every man shall be put to death for his
                   own sin.
            17           Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, or the
                   orphan, or the widow.                          Thou shalt not take the garment of a
            18 widow in pledge, but remember that thou wast a servant in the
                   land of Egypt, and that thence the Lord thy God redeemed
                   thee ; therefore I command thee to do this thing.
   Ch. XXV.           DEUTERONOMY.
   19   When thou reapest thy harvest in the field, if thou hast
     forgot a sheaf in thy field, thou shalt not turn back to take it
     up ; it shall be for the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow,
     that the Lord thy God may bless thee, in all the works of thy
   20 hands.And when thou gatherest thine olives, thou shalt not
     turn back to gather what was left behind thee : it shall be for
      the stranger and the orphan and the widow ; and thou shalt re-
     member that thou wast a stranger in the land of Egypt ; there-
   21 fore I command thee to do this thing. And when thou gatherest
     in the vintage, thou shalt not glean after thee.The gleanings
   22 shall be for the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow ; and
     thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of
     Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing.
   XXV.     When a controversy happeneth between men, and
     they have come to a trial, and the trial is over, and the righte-
      ous is acquitted, and the criminal known ; in case the criminal
    2 deserve to be beaten, thou shalt make him lie down, before
      the judges ; and they shall cause him to be beaten, in their pre-
    3 sence, according to his wickedness.With the number of forty
      stripes they may cause him to be beaten.They shall not ex-
      ceed that.If thou shouldst proceed to inflict more stripes than
      these, thy brother will become vile in thy sight.
    4   Thou shalt not muzzle an ox treading out corn.
    5   When brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and
      hath no issue, the wife of him who died shall not marry a man
      abroad, who is not near of kin.The brother of her husband
      shall go in unto her, and take her to wife, and cohabit with her ;
    6 and the child which she shall bear shall go by the name of him
      who died, so that his name shall not be blotted out from among
    7 Israel.And if any man decline to take his brother's wife, the
      woman shall go to the gate, to the senate, and say, My hus-
      band's brother refuseth to raise up his brother's name in Israel.
    8 My husband's brother hath refused.Thereupon the senate of
      his city shall send for him, and say to him, Thou must stand
    9 up, and say, I will not take her.Upon which his brother's wife
      shall come, in the presence of the senate, and loose one shoe
      from his foot, and spit before his face, and addressing him, say,
      So shall be done to the man who will not build up his bro-
       Ch. XXVI.                 DEUTERONOMY.
      10 tker's house in Israel.    And his name shall be called in Israel,
          The house of him who had his shoe loosed.
      11      When men fight togetherâ€”a man with his brother, if the
          wife of one of them come to rescue her husband out of the
          hand of him who is beating him, and stretching forth her hand?
       12 take hold of his privities, thou shalt cut off her hand.        Thine
          eye shall not have compassion on her.
       13     Thou shalt not have in thy bag different weights, a great
          and a small ; nor shall there be in thy house, different measures,
       1-1 a great and a small.    Thou shalt have a just and true weight,
       15 and thou shalt have a just and true measure ; that thy days may
          be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for a
       16 possession ; for every one who doth these thingsâ€”every one
          who committeth injustice, is an abomination to the Lord thy
          God.
       17     Remember what Amalek did to thee by the way, when
       18 thou wast coming out of the land of Egyptâ€”how he rose up
          against thee, in the way, and smote thy rear, those who were
       19 fainty behind thee.     Thou indeed wast hungry, and fainty, and
          he feared not God.       Therefore when the Lord thy God hath
          given thee rest from all thine enemies around thee, in the land
          which the Lord thy God giveth thee for a possession, thou shalt
          blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven.            Thou must
          not forget.
       XXYI.       Now, when thou art come to the land which the Lord
          thy God giveth thee for a possession, and hast taken possession
        2 of it, and dwelt therein ; thou shalt take some of the first fruits
          of thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and put them
          in a basket, and go to the place which the Lord thy God hath
        3 chosen for his name to be there invoked ; and thou shalt go
          to the priest, who shall be in those days, and say to him, I ac-
          knowledge this day to the Lord my God, that I am come to
          the land which the Lord solemnly promised our fathers to give
        4 us.   Thereupon the priest shall take the basket out of thy hands,
          and set it down over against the altar of the Lord thy God,
        5 and in the presence of the Lord shall answer, and say, My fa-
          ther left Syria, and went down into Egypt, and sojourned there,
           with a small number, and became there a great nation, and a
        6 vast multitude.    And when the Egyptians afflicted us, and hum-
                                                                       â€”
     Ch. XXVI.              DEUTERONOMY.
        bled us, and imposed upon us hard labours, and we cried to
      7 the Lord our God, the Lord heard our voice.        When he saw
        our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression, the Lord
      8 himself brought us out of Egypt with his great power, and
        with his strong hand, and outstretched arm, and with great vi-
      9 sions, and with signs, and with wonders, and brought us to
        this place, and gave us this landâ€”a land flowing with milk and
     10 honey.   Now therefore, behold, I have brought this offering of
        the products of the land, which thou,     Lord, hast given me
        a land flowing with milk and honey.     Then thou shalt leave it
        before the Lord thy God ; and when thou hast worshipped be-
    ll fore the Lord thy God, thou shalt regale thyself with all the
        good things which the Lord thy God hath given thee, thou,
        and thy family, and the Levite, and the proselyte who is with
        thee.
    12      And when thou hast finished tything the tenth of all thy
        produce in the third year, thou shalt give another tenth to the
        Levite, and the proselyte, and the orphan, and the widow, that
    13 they may eat in thy cities, and be regaled.    Then thou shalt say
        before the Lord thy God, I have removed the hallowed things
        clean out of my house, and have given them to the Levite, and
        the proselyte, and the orphan, and the widow, according to all
    14 the commands which thou hast commanded me.             I have not
        transgressed thy command, nor forgot it.      I have not, in my
        mourning, eaten any of them, nor offered any of them in ho-
        mage to an unclean thing, nor given any of them to the dead.
        I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God.         I have
    15 done as thou hast commanded me.         Look down from thy holy
        habitationâ€”from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and this
        land which thou hast given them, as thou clidst solemnly pro-
        mise our fathers to give us a land flowing with milk and honey.
    16     This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to prac-
        tise all these rules of rectitude and these judgments ; you shall
        therefore keep, and perform them, with your whole heart, and
    17 with your whole soul.     Thou hast this day chosen God to be
        thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his rules of recti-
    18 tude, and his judgments, and to hearken to his voice.     And the
        Lord hath this day chosen thee to be a peculiar people to him-
        self, as he hath said, that thou mayst keep his commandments,
                                                                                                                  ;
         XXVII.                               DEUTEKONOMY.
              and be, as he hath made thee, renowned above all the nations,
         19 and a boast, and glorious, and that thou mayst be a people de-
              dicated to the Lord, as he hath spoken.
         XXVII.           Again Moses, with the senate of Israel, gave a charge,
              saying, You shall keep all these commandments which I this
              day command you.
          2         When you have crossed the Jordan, into the land which
              the Lord thy God giveth thee ; thou shalt set up for thyself
              large stones, and plaister them with mortar, and thou shalt
          3 write on those stones all the words of this law.                                   Soon as you
              have crossed the Jordanâ€”when you are come to the land
              which the Lord the God of thy fathers giveth theeâ€”a land
              flowing with milk and honey, as the Lord the God of thy fa-
          4 thers promised thee, you shall, immediately after your cross-
              ing the Jordan, set up these stones, which I this day command
              thee, at mount Garizin, and thou shalt plaister them with mor-
           5 tar, and build there an altar to the Lord thy Godâ€”an altar of
           6 stones.        Thou shalt not lift up a tool upon it.                           Of unwrought
              stones thou shalt build the altar to the Lord thy God, and of-
           7 fer upon it whole burnt offerings to the Lord thy God.                                        Then
              thou shalt offer there a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and when thou
           8 hast eaten, and art filled, and hast rejoiced before the Lord
              thy God ; then thou shalt write upon the stones all this law, in
              the plainest manner.
           9        Then Moses with the priests, the Levites, spoke to all Is-
              rael, saying,
         10         Be silent and hear, O Israel.                       Thou art this day made a
              people for the Lord thy God ; therefore thou shalt hearken to
              the voice of the Lord thy Gocl, and perform all his command-
              ments, and his rules of rectitude, which I this day com-
         11 mand thee.              Then Moses gave a charge to the people that day,
               saying, Having crossed the Jordan, these shall stand on mount
         12 Garizin to bless the peopleâ€”Symeon, Levi, Judas, Issachar,
         13 Joseph, and Benjamin.                    And these shall stand at the curse on
               mount Gaibal, Keuben, Gad, and Aser, Zabulon, Dan, and
         14 Nephthaleim : and the Levites shall address all Israel, and say
               with a loud voice,
          15        Cursed the man who shall make a graven, or molten image,
               an abomination to the Lord, the work of the hands of artists
    Ch. XXVIII.          DEUTEKONOMY.
       though he set it up iu a secret place.And all the people shall
       answer and say, Amen.
    16    Cursed he who slighteth his father or his mother.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    17    Cursed he who removeth his neighbour's land mark.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    18    Cursed he who leadeth the blind out of the way.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    19    Cursed he who perverteth the judgment of the stranger, or
       the orphan, or the widow.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    20    Cursed he who lieth with his father's wife, because he hath
       uncovered his father's skirt.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    21    Cursed he who lieth with any beast.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    22    Cursed he who lieth with his sister, by the same father, or
       mother.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    23    Cursed he who lieth with his daughter in law.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    24    Cursed he who lieth with the sister of his wife.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    25    Cursed he who smiteth his neighbour secretly.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    26    Cursed he who taketh bribes to slay an innocent person.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    27    Cursed be every man who will not persevere in all the
       words of this law, to do them.
                        And all the people shall say, Amen.
    XXVIII.     Now it shall come to pass, that if thou wilt hearken
       diligently to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep and per-
       form all these commandments which I this day give thee in
       charge, the Lord thy God will set thee high above all the na-
       tions of the earth ; and all these blessings shall come upon thee,
       and find thee.
     2    If thou wilt hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord thy
     3 God, Blessed shalt thou be in the city ; and blessed shalt thou
     4 be in the held ; blessed shall be the fruit of thy budy, and the
               â€”

       Oh.
        5 products of thy land, and thy herds, and thy flocks.    Blessed
          shall be thy granaries, and thy stores.
        6     Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed
        7 when thou goest out.   May the Lord thy God deliver up thine
          enemies, who rise up against thee, to be smitten before thee.
          They shall come out against thee one way, and flee before
          thee seven ways.
        8     The Lord send upon thee the blessing in thy store houses,
          and on all the labours of thy hands, in the land which the Lord
          thy God giveth thee.
        9     The Lord establish thee a holy people for himself, as he
          solemnly promised thy fathers.    If thou wilt hearken to the
       10 voice of the Lord thy God, and walk in all his ways, then shall
          all the nations of the earth see that thou art called by the name
       11 of the Lord, and they will be afraid of thee ; and the Lord thy
          God will multiply thee, for good, in the offspring of thy body,
          and in the increase of thy cattle, and in the products of thy
          ground, in the land which he solemnly promised thy fathers to
           give thee.
       12     The Lord open for thee his good treasury, the heaven, to
           give thy land the rain in due season.Mayhe bless all the works
           of thy hands, so that thou mayst lend to many nations, and
       13 not borrow of them ; and that thou mayst rule over many na-
           tions, and they not rule over thee.May the Lord establish thee
           for a head and not for a tail, so that thou mayst be above, and
           not beneath.
              If thou wilt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to
           keep all that I this day enjoin thee, thou wilt not turn aside from
       14 all the commandments which I this day command thee, either to
           the right, or to the left, to go after other gods, to serve them.
       15 But in case thou wilt not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy
           God to keep all his commandments which I this day give thee
           in charge, all these evils shall come upon thee and overtake
           thee
        16    Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed thou in the
        17 field.  Cursed shall be thy granaries, and thy stores.  Cursed
        18 shall be the offspring of thy body, and the products of thy land,
        19 thy herds and thy flocks.    Cursed shalt thou be when thou
       20 comest in, and cursed thou when thou goest out.       The Lord
    Ch. XXVIII.           DEUTERONOMY.
       send upon thee want, and famine, and destruction on all the
       labour of thy hands, until he utterly root thee out, and until
        he destroy thee quickly, on the account of thy wicked devices.
    21 Seeing thou hast forsaken me, may the Lord make the pesti-
       lence cleave to thee, until it utterly consume thee from the land
    22 to which thou art going, to take possession of it. The Lord
       smite thee with anxiety, and fever, and chilness, and restless-
       ness, and blasting, and mildew, that they may pursue thee un-
    23 til they utterly destroy thee.And when the heaven over thy
       head shall be brass, and the earth under thy feet iron, may the
    24 Lord thy God make the rain of thy land dust, so that dust
       from heaven may descend until it waste thee, and until it de-
    25 stroy thee speedily. May the Lord deliver thee up to slaugh-
       ter before thine enemies, so that thou mayst go out one way to
    26 meet them, and flee seven ways from before them ; and be a
        dispersion among all the kingdoms of the earth ; and your dead
        carcasses be food for the birds of the air, and the wild beasts of
    27 the earth, and there be none to fray them away.    The Lord
        smite thee with the Egyptian boil in thy seat, and with
        wild fire, and with itching, so that thou canst not be cured.
    28 The Lord smite thee with madness, and blindness, and as-
    29 tonishment of heart, so that thou mayst grope about at noon
        day, as a blind man gropeth in darkness ; and let him not pros-
        per thy ways, so thou shalt then be injured, and spoiled conti-
    30 nually, and there will be none to help thee. Thou wilt take a
        wife, and another man shall have her.Thou wilt build a house,
        but shall not dwell therein. Thou wilt plant a vineyard, but
    31 shalt not gather the grapes thereof.Thy ox will be slaughtered
        before thy face, and thou shalt not eat thereof.Thy ass will
        be taken from thee, and shall not be restored ; thy flocks will
        be given to thine enemies, and there shall be none to help
    32 thee; thy sons, and thy daughters, will be given to another
        nation, and thine eyes will melt in looking at them; there will
    33 be no strength in thy hand. A nation, which thou knowest not
        will eat the fruits of thy land, and all thy labours ; and thou
    34 shalt be injured, and oppressed continually, and driven to mad-
        ness at the sight of thine eyes, which thou shalt see.
    35     The Lord smite thee with a grievous boil on thy knees,
        and on thy legs, so that thou canst not be healed, from the sole
           VOL. I.                xx

      36 of thy feet to the crown of thy head.  The Lord carry away
         thee, and thy rulers, whom thou mayst set over thee, to
         a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers knew, that thou
      37 mayst there serve other godsâ€”stocks and stones ; and be there
         for a bye word, and a proverb, and a public example to all the
      38 nations to which the Lord shall bring thee. There thou shalt
         carry out much seed into the field, and shalt bring little home,
      39 for the locust shall devour it ; thou shalt plant a vineyard and
         dress it ; but shalt not press out wine, nor regale thyself from
      40 it ; for worms shall eat it up.Thou shalt have plantations of
         olive trees, in all thy borders, but shalt not be anointed with
      41 oil, for thine olive tree shall cast its fruit : thou shalt beget sons
         and daughters, but shalt not have them with thee ; for they
      42 shall go into captivity.All thy trees and the products of thy
      43 land, shall be consumed with blasting. The stranger who is
         with thee shall rise higher and higher ; but thou shalt fall low-
      44 er and lower. He shall lend to thee ; and thou shalt not lend
      45 to him : He shall be head ; and thou shalt be tail.All these
         curses shall actually come upon thee, and pursue thee, and
         overtake thee, until he root thee out, and utterly destroy thee
         because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy
         God, to keep his commandments, and his rules of rectitude,
     46 which he commanded thee, And they shall be signs for thee,
         and wonders for thine offspring forever.
     47     Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with glad-
         ness, and with a good understanding, for the abundance of all
     48 things ; therefore thou shalt serve thine enemies, whom the
         Lord will send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in
         nakedness, and in want of all things, and thou shalt wear a yoke
     49 of iron on thy neck, until it utterly destroy thee.The Lord
         will bring against thee a nation from afarâ€”from the extremi-
     50 ty of the earth, with the impetuosity of an eagleâ€”A nation
         whose voice thou shalt not understandâ€”a nation of an un-
         blushing countenance, which will not respect the person of an
     51 elder, nor compassionate a youth.And it shall devour the in-
         crease of thy cattle, and the products of thy land, so as not to
         leave thee corn, wine, oil, herds or flocks, until it hath destroyed
        thee, and wasted thee in thy citiesâ€”until they have demolished
     52 thy high, and strong walls, in which thou hast placed thy con-
                                                                                                                          ;

         53 fidence, throughout thy whole laud.                                 And when he shall afflict
               thee in thy cities which he hath given thee ; in thy siege, and
               in the affliction, with which thine enemy shall afflict thee, thou
               shalt eat the offspring of thy bodyâ€”the flesh of thy sons., and
         54 thy daughters, whom he gave thee.                                   The tender, and very de-
               licate man who is with thee, will look with an evil eye on his
               brother, and on the wife in his bosom, and the remaining chil-
         55 dren which may be left him, so as not to give one of them any
              of the flesh of his sons, which he may be eating, because he hath
              nothing left him in the siege, and in that affliction of thine with
        56 which thine enemies will afflict thee, in all thy cities.                                         And the
              tender, and very delicate woman among you, whose foot never
              ventured to tread the ground because of her delicateness, and
              effeminacy will look with an evil eye on her husband in her
              bosom, and on her son, and her daughter, even the female in-
              fant she bore, or the male child which she may have brought
        57 forth ; for on the account of the want of all things, she will eat
              these secretly in thy siege, and in that affliction of thine with
              which thine enemy will afflict thee in thy cities.
        58          If thou wilt not hearken to do all the words of this law,
              which are written in this book, to fear this glorious, this won-
        59 derful name, The Lord tliy God, the Lord will make thy
              plagues, and the plagues of thy seed, wonderful beyond con-
              ceptionâ€”he will make them great, and marvellous, and thy
              diseases sore, and lasting, and will bring upon thee all the af-
        60 fliction of Egyptâ€”that grievous affliction which thou didst
        61 dread on their account, and they shall cleave to thee.                                           The Lord
              will also bring upon thee every sickness, and every plague,
              which is not written, and every one which is written in this
        62 book of the law, until he root thee out.                                    And you shall be left
              few in number, instead of being, as you were, like the stars of
        63 heaven for multitude.                       Because thou didst not hearken to the
              voice of the Lord thy God, therefore it shall come to pass, that
              as the Lord delighted in you to do you good, and to multiply
              you; so the Lord will rejoice over you, in rooting you out
              and you shall be removed speedily from the land to which
        61 thou art going to take possession of it.                                 And the Lord thy God
              will scatter thee among all the uations, from one extremity of
              the earth to the other ; and thou shalt there serve other gods
                                                               â€”!
      Ch. XXIX.           DEUTERONOMY.
         â€”stocks and stones, which neither thou, nor thy fathers have
     65 known. Butevenamong these nations he will not give thee rest,
         nor shall there be any rest for the sole of thy foot.Indeed the
        Lord will give thee there a strange trembling heart, and failing
     66 eyes, and a desponding soul, and thy life shall hang in sus-
        pence before thine eyes, and thou shalt be in terror, day and
     67 night, and have no assurance of thy life.In the morning thou
        wilt say ; How will it be with me in the evening !And in the
        evening thou wilt say, How may it be with me in the morning
        on account of the terror of thy heart with which thou shalt be
        affrighted, and on account of the sights of thine eyes which
     68 thou shalt see.And the Lord will send thee back into Egypt,
        in ships, (by the way which I ordered thou shalt see it no
        more :) and thou shalt there be exposed to sale to your ene-
        mies, for bond men and bond women, and there will be no pur-
        chaser.
     XXIX.      These were the words of the covenant, which the
        Lord commanded Moses to state to the children of Israel, in
        the land of Moab, over and above the covenant which he had
        made with them at Choreb.
      2    Then Moses called all the sons of Israel, and said to them,
        You have seen all the things which the Lord did in Egypt, be-
        fore your eyes, to Pharao and his servants, and all his land
      3 those great trials which your eyes have seen, those signs, and
      4 those great wonders. Now hath not the Lord God given you
        a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, even at this
      5 day ?  When he led you forty years in the wilderness, your
        clothes did not grow too old, nor were your shoes worn out
      6 from your feet. You did not eat bread, nor drink wine, nor
      7 strong drink, that you might know that the Lord lam is your God.
        And when you came to this place, and Seon, king of Esebon, and
      8 Og king of Basan, came out to meet us in battle, we smote them,
        and took their land, and I have given it to Reuben, and Gad, and
      9 to the half of the tribe of Manasses : you shall therefore be care-
     10 ful to perform all the words of this covenant.In order that you
         might fully comprehend all that you are to do, you have this
         day stood, all of you, before the Lord your God, the chiefs of
         your tribes, and your senate, and your judges, and your offi-
      11 cers, every man of Israel, your wives, and your children, and
    Ch. XXTX.             DEUTERONOMY.
       the stranger who is in your camp, from the hewer of wood to
    12 the drawer of water, to enter into a covenant with the Lord your
    13 God, and into the curses which the Lord thy God this day
       stateth to thee, that he may establish thee a people for himself.
    14 So he himself will be thy God, as he said to thee, and as he
       hath sworn to thy fathers, Abraham, and Isaak, and Jacob.
    15 Now I make this covenant, and this oath, not with you only,
       but both with those who are here this day, with you before
       the Lord your God, and with those who are not here with you
    16 this day. Inasmuch as you know how we lived in the land of
    17 Egypt, and have seen, as we passed through the nations,
       through which you passed, their abominations and their idols,
    18 wood and stone, silver and gold, which are among them ; is
       there any man among you, or any woman, or family, or tribe,
       whose understanding hath turned them from the Lord your
       God, to go and serve the gods of those nations ? Is there any
       such root among you, springing up for gall and bitterness ?
    19 Now in case any one shall hear the words of this curse, and
       bless himself in his heart, saying, Good luck betide me !I will
       walk in the error of my own heart, that the sinner may not in-
    20 volve the guiltless in ruin with himself.God will not be pro-
       pitious to him, but most assuredly the anger of the Lord, and
       his indignation, will then be kindled against that man ; and all
       the curses of this covenant, which are written in this book,
    21 shall cleave to him ; and the Lord will blot out his name from
       under heaven.   The Lord will indeed separate him, from all
       the children of Israel, according to all the curses of this cove-
    22 nant, which are written in this book of the law.  And when
       the generations to comeâ€”your children who shall rise up af-
       ter yon, and the stranger who may come from a far distant
       country, will sayâ€”when they shall see the plagues of that
       land, and the diseases thereof, which the Lord hath sent upon
    23 itâ€”brimstone and burnt saltâ€”when through the whole land
       there shall be no sowingâ€”no natural productions, no verdure
       on it, a destruction like that of Sodom and Gomorra, Adama
       and Seboim, which the Lord overthrew with wrath and indig-
    24 nationâ€”When all the nations shall say, Why hath the Lord
       dealt thus witli this land? What hath occasioned this great
    25 fierceness of indignation ?Then they will say, Because they
        Ch. XXX.                  DEUTERONOMY.
            forsook the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers,
            which he made with their fathers, when he brought them out
        26 of the land of Egypt, and went and served strange gods, which
        27 they did not know, and which he had not arranged for them,
            therefore the Lord was provoked to wrath against this land, to
            bring upon it all the curses which are written in the book of
        28 the law; and the Lord rooted them out from their land, with
            wrath, and anger, and very great indignation, and cast them
            out into another land, as at this day.
        29     The things which are secret are for the Lord our God ; but
            the things which are manifest are forus and our children forever,
        XXX.       that we may perform all the words of this law ; there-
           fore when all these things have come upon thee, the blessing
           and the curse, which I have set before thee ; and thou shalt re-
           ceive them into thy heart, among all the nations where the Lord
         2 may have dispersed thee ; and shalt turn to the Lord thy God,
           and hearken to his voice, according to all that I this day com-
         3 mand thee, with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul ; the
           Lord will heal thy sins, and have compassion on thee, and ga-
           ther thee again out of all the nations among which the Lord
         â€¢Ahath dispersed thee.      Though thy dispersion may have been
           from one end of the earth to the other, thence the Lord thy
         5 God will gather thee, and thence the Lord thy God will take
           thee, and thence thy God will bring thee, into the land which
         6 thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it : And he will
           deal kindly with thee, and make thee more numerous than thy
           fathers : And the Lord will purify thy heart, and the heart of
           thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and
         7 with thy whole soul, that thou mayst live.        And the Lord thy
           God will lay all these curses upon thine enemies, and upon them
         8 who hate thee, and have persecuted thee.          When thou shalt
           return, and hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and per-
         9 form these commandments of his, which I this day enjoin thee,
           the Lord thy God will bless thee in every work of thy hands,
           in the offspring of thy body, and in the increase of thy cattle,
           and in the products of thy land ; for the Lord thy God will turn
           again to rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fa-
       ll) thers, if thou wilt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God to
           keep his commandments, and his rules of rectitude, and these
     Oh. XXXI.                 DEUTEEONOMY.
        judgments of his which are written in this book of the lawâ€”if
        thou wilt turn to the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and
    11 with thy whole soul.       For this command which I this day give
    12 thee in charge is not grievous, nor is it far from thee.        It is not
        in heaven above, that thou shouldst say, Who will ascend for us
        into heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear and do it ?
    13 Nor is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldst say, Who will
        cross the sea for us, and bring it to us, and let us hear it, that
    14 we may do it?       The word is very near thee, in thy mouth and
        in thy heart, and in thy hand, to do it.
    15      Behold I have this day set before thee Life and Death,
    16 Good and Evil.       If thou wilt hearken to the commandments of
        the Lord thy God which I this day enjoin thee, to love the
        Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his rules of
        rectitude, and his judgments, you shall live, and multiply, and
        the Lord thy God will bless thee in all the land to which thou
    17 art going, there to take possession of it.       But if thy heart turn
        aside, and thou wilt not hearken, but go astray, and worship
    18 other gods, and serve them, I announce to thee this day, that
        you shall surely perish, and shall not prolong your lives in the
        land, to which you are about to cross the Jordan, to take pos-
    19 session of it.   I call heaven and earth this day to witness against
       you, that I have set Life and Death, the Blessing and the Curse
    20 before you.    Chuse thou life, that thou and thy seed may live,
       by loving the Lord thy God, and hearkening to his voice, and
       cleaving to him.     For this is thy life, and the lengthening of thy
       days, to dwell in the land which the Lord solemnly promised
       thy fathers, Abraham, and Isaak, and Jacob, that he would
        give them.
    XXXI.        When Moses had finished speaking all these words,
     2 to all the children of Israel, he said to them, I am now a hun-
       dred and twenty years old.        I shall no more be able to go out,
       and come in before you : for the Lord hath said to me, Thou
     3 shalt not cross the Jordan.       The Lord thy God, who goeth be-
       fore thee, will himself drive out those nations from before thee,
        and thou shalt possess them ; and Joshua is to go before thee,
     4 as the Lord hath spoken.         The Lord thy God will indeed do
       to them as he did to Seon, and Og, the two kings of the Amor-
        ites, who were on this side the Jordan, and to their landâ€”in
                                                                                                                    ;;
                 XXXI.                          DEUTEKOXOMY.
           Oh.
                the same maimer as the Lord rooted them out, and delivered
             5 them up to you.                 And you shall do to them as I have com-
             9 manded you.               Act manfully, and be strong; fear not, nor be
                faint hearted, nor terrified at them ; for the Lord thy God, who
                goeth before you, is with youâ€”is among you.                                    May he never
                leave thee, nor forsake thee.
             7        Then Moses called Joshua, and said to him before all Is-
                rael, Be courageous, and strong ; for thou shalt go before this
                people, into the land which the Lord solemnly promised your
                lathers to give them ; and thou shalt put them in possession of
             8 it ; and the Lord, who marcheth with thee, will not leave thee
                nor forsake thee.             Fear not, nor be dismayed.
             9        Xow Moses had written the words of this law in a book
                so he gave it to the priests, the children of Levi, who carry
                the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to the elders of the
           10 children of Israel.               And Moses gave them a charge on that day
                saying, At the end of every seven years, at the Solemnity of
           11 the Kelease, during the festival of tabernacles, when all Israel
                assemble, to appear before the Lord your God, in the place
                which the Lord shall chuse ; you shall read this law before all
           12 Israel, in their hearing.                 Let the people be assembled, the men,
                and the women, and the children, and the proselyte who is
                in your cities, that they may hear, and that they may learn to
                fear the Lord your God; and let them hearken to do all the
           13 words of this law.                And let their children who have not known,
                hearken, and learn to fear the Lord thy God, all the days they
                live in the land to which you are going, to cross the Jordan,
                there to take possession of it.
           14         Xow when the Lord said to Moses, Behold the time of thy
                death approacheth, call Joshua, and stand at the doors of the
                tabernacle of the testimony, and I will give him a charge
                thereupon Moses went with Joshua to the tabernacle of the
                testimony, and they stood at the doors of the tabernacle of the
           15 testimony, and the Lord descended in a cloud, and stood at
           16 the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony, and while the pil-
                lar of the cloud stood at the doors of the tabernacle of the tes-
                timony, the Lord said to Moses, Behold when thou sleepest
                with thy fathers, this people will rise up, and go a whoring
                after the strange gods of the land to which they are going.
     Ch. XXXI.                 DEUTERONOMY.
         And when they forsake me, and break my covenant which
     17 I have made with them, I shall be provoked to wrath against
         them that day, and I will leave them, and turn away my face
         from them, and they shall be devoured.             And when many
         evils and afflictions shall befal them, then will one say in
         that day, Because the Lord my God is not with me, these evils
     18 have befallen me.     But I will turn away my face from them, on
         that day, because of all their wickedness which they have
     19 committed, because they have turned to strange gods.               Now
         therefore write the words of this Ode and teach it to the chil-
         dren of Israel, and put it into their mouth, that this Ode may
     20 be an open witness for me among the children of Israel.            For
         when I bring them into that good land, which I solemnly pro-
         mised their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and
         honey, they will eat, and be satiated, and they will turn to
         strange gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my
     21 covenant ; but this Ode will rise up, and witness against them ;
         for it shall never be forgotten out of their mouth, nor out of the
         mouth of their seed : for I know their wickedness, what they
         do even now before I have brought them into that good land
         which I solemnly promised their fathers.
     22      So Moses wrote the Ode that day and taught it to the chil-
     23 dren of Israel.    And the Lord gave a charge to Joshua, and
         said, Be courageous, and strong, for thou shalt conduct the
         children of Israel into the land which the Lord solemnly pro-
         mised them, and he will be with thee.
     21      Now when Moses had made an end of writing all the words
     25 of this law in a book, even to the close, he gave a charge to the
         Levites, who carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, say-
     26 ing, Take this book of the law ; and put it by the side of the
         ark of the covenant of the Lord your God ; and it shall be
     27 there for a witness against thee ; for I know thy contentious
         disposition, and thy stiff neck.  For even now while I am yet alive
         with you, you have been rebellious against God ; how then can
     28 it be otherwise after my death ?      Assemble before me the heads
         of your tribes, and your elders, and your judges, and your un-
         der officers, that I may speak in their hearing all these words
     21) and call heaven and earth to witness against them.       For I know
         that after my death you will commit iniquity, and turn aside
            vol. i.                     v v
                                                                              ; ;â€”â€”     ;â€”â€” â€”
                   XXXII.                             DEUTERONOMY.
            Ch.
                  out of the way which I commanded you, and evils will befal
                  you in the latter days, because you will do evil before the Lord,
                  to provoke him to wrath by the works of your hands.
            30          Then for a conclusion Moses spoke in the hearing of all the
                  congregation the words of this Ode.
            XXXII.                Listen,          heaven, and I will speak,
                        And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
              2         Let my doctrine be expected like rain,
                        And my words distil as the dew ;
                        Like gentle rain on the tender herb,
                        And like a heavy shower on the grass.
              3         Since I have proclaimed the name of the Lord,
                        Ascribe ye majesty to our God.
              4         He is God, his works are perfect
                        All his ways are acts of judgment
                        A faithful God ; he doth no injustice
                        Righteous and holy is the Lord.
              5             They have sinned ! blemished children are not his.
                        Crooked and perverse generation !
              6         Do ye thus requite the Lord ?
                        Are the people so foolish and unwise ?
                        Did not this thy father purchase thee ?
                        Did he not make and fashion thee ?
              7             Remember the days of old ;
                        Consider the years of ages past
                        Ask thy father ; he can tell thee
                        Thine elders ; they can inform thee :
              8         When the Most High divided nations
                        When he dispersed the children of Adam,
                        He settled the boundaries of nations,
                        According to the number of God's messengers ;
              9         And the Lord's portion was his people Jacob
                        Israel was his lot of inheritance.
             10             He sustained them in the wilderness,
                        In the drought of heat, in a land without water.
                        He led them about, and instructed them
                        He kept them as the apple of his eye.
             11             As an eagle would defend his nest,
                        And, when anxious for his young,
                                             â€”; ; ;;â€”â€”â€”â€”;;â€”;
     Ch. XXXII.             DEUTERONOMY.
           Would spread out his wings, and receive them,
           And bare them up on his shoulders ;
     12     The Lord alone conducted them,
           And there was not a strange god with them.
     13       He brought them up to the strength of this land,
           He fed them with the products of the fields
           They sucked honey out of a rock,
           And oil out of a flinty rock ;
     14    With butter of kine, and with milk of sheep
           With the fattest of lambs and rams, young bulls and goats,
           And with bread of the choicest wheat
           And they drank wine, the pure juice of the grape.
     15       When Jacob had eaten and was filled,
           Then he who was beloved began to kick
           He grew fat, waxed thick, and became corpulent,
           Then he forsook the God who made him
           And apostatised from God his saviour.
     16       They exasperated me with strange gods,
           With their abominations they provoked me,
     17    They sacrificed to demons, and not to God
           To gods, which they had never known,
           Which had started up, new and fictitious,
           Of which their fathers had no knowledge,
     18       The God who begot thee, thou hast forsaken,
           And hast forgot the God who nourished thee
     19    And the Lord saw, and was provoked to jealousy
           He was provoked at the temper of his sons and daughters,
     20    xVnd said, I will turn away my face from them,
           And shew what shall befal them in the latter days.
             Because they are a perverse generation
           Children, who have no faith in them
     21    They have provoked me by what is not God
           Have exasperated me with their idols ;
           I therefore will provoke them by what is not a nation,
           By a foolish nation I will vex them.
     22       Since a fire is kindled because of my wrath,
           It shall burn down to the lowest Hades
           It shall consume the land, and the products thereof
           It shall set on fire the foundations of mountains :
                                                                   â€” ;                ;           ; â€”â€”;;â€”               ;

          Ch.
          23          I will assemble evils against them,
                      And hurl my bolts at them.
          24              While they are wasting by famine, and voracious birds ;
                      The burning carbuncle also shall be incurable
                      I will send against them the teeth of wild beasts,
                      With the venom of serpents, trailing on the ground.
         25           Abroad the sword shall bereave them of children,
                     And in their chambers terror shall destroy.
                     The youth shall perish with the young virgin,
                     The sucking infant with the venerable sage.
         26              I had determined to disperse them,
                     And cause the remembrance of them to cease among men
         27          Had it not been for the temper of enemies ;
                     That the adversaries might not out live them
                     That they might not fall upon them at once
                     Lest they should say, Our own high hand,
                     And not the Lord, hath done all this.
         28          It is a nation devoid of counsel
                     There is no knowledge among them.
         29          They have not bent their minds to understand
                     Let them lay up these things for time to come.
         30                  How could one man chase a thousand,
                     And two put myriads to flight,
                     Had not God cast them off
                     Had not the Lord delivered them up ?
         31          For their gods are not like our God ;
                     And our enemies are without understanding.
         32                  As their vine is from the vine of Sodom
                     And their shoot from that of Gomorra
                     Their cluster of grapes will be a cluster of gall
                     A cluster of bitterness it shall be to them :
         33                  Their wine shall be the venom of dragons
                     The incurable venom of asps.
         34                  Behold ! are not these things stored up with me ?
                     And sealed up among my treasures ?
         35          In the day of vengeance I will requite,
                     When their foot shall be supplanted.
                     Because the day of destruction is nigh for them,
                     Therefore at hand are the things prepared for you.
                                                                                 ;â€” â€” â€”

                   When he shall be appeased for his servants,
                   (For he saw that they were enfeebled,
                   Made faint by hostile invasions and dejected)
       37          Then the Lord said, where are their gods
                   The gods in which they placed their confidence ?
       38          The fat of those sacrifices you ate
                   And drank the wine of their libations ?
                   Let them arise and help you,

                  I can smite and I can heal,
                  And none can rescue out of my hand
      40          For I can lift up my hand to heaven,
                  And swear by my right hand, and say, as I live forever,
      41          I will make my sword sharp as lightning,
                  And my hand will support judgment
                  And I will execute vengeance on mine enemies,
                  And make retribution to them who hate me.
      42                  I will make my arrows drunk with blood,
                  And my sword shall devour flesh
                  With the blood of slain and captives.
      43          From the head of enemy chiefs.
                  Rejoice,          heavens, with him,
                  And let all the angels of God worship him :
                  Rejoice,          nations, with his people,
                  And let all the children of God rely on him :
                  For he avengeth the blood of his children,
                  And will judge, and execute vengeance on his enemies,
                  To them who hate him he will render retribution,
                  And the Lord will purify the land of his people.
      44         Now on that day when Moses had written this Ode and taught
      45 it to the children of Israel ; and he, and Joshua the son of Nave,
            had come, and spoken all the words of this law in the hearing
           of the people, Moses concluded his speech to all Israel with this
      46 address to them, Attend with your heart to all these words
            which I this day testify to you, and which you are to give in
                                                                                !
            Ch. XXXIII.                               DEUTERONOMY.
                 charge to your children, that they may keep, and perform all
           47 the words of this law ; for this is not a vain thing for you ; for
                 it is your life ; and, for the sake of this word, you shall prolong
                 your days in the land to which you are going, to cross the
                  Jordan to take possession.
           48          Then the Lord spoke to Moses that day, saying, Go up
                 the mountain Abarim, to that mount Nabo, which is in the
                  land of Moab, fronting Jericho, and take a view of the land of
            49 Chanaan, which I give to the children of Israel; and die on
            50 the mount to which thou goest up, and be gathered to thy peo-
                  ple, in the same manner as thy brother Aaron died on mount
            51 Or, and was gathered to his people, because you disobeyed
                  my word among the children of Israel, at the water of strife,
            52 at Kades, in the wilderness of Sin.                                 Because you did not hal-
                  low me among the children of Israel, thou shalt see the land at
                  a distance, but shalt not go in thither.
            XXXIII.               Now this is the blessing with which Moses, the man
                  of God blessed the children of Israel, before his death ; and
                  he said,
              2         The Lord came from Sina
                        And shined upon us out of Seir ;
                        He hasted from mount Paran,
                        With myriads from Kades ;
                        His angels with him on his right.
              3                 He compassionated his people ;
                        All the sanctified are under thy sway,
                        But these are immediately under thee.
              4                 From His words Moses received the law
                        Which he gave in charge to us,
                        An inheritance for the assemblies of Jacob.
               5                Let Him therefore be chief among the beloved.
                         When the chiefs of peoples assemble with the tribes of Is-
                            rael,
               6         Let Reuben live and not die,
                         And Symeon though he be few in number.
               7                 Now this was the blessing of Juda
                         Hear,         Lord, the voice of Juda
                         And until thou comest to his people ;
                         Let his hands contend for them,
                                                                :
                 XXXIII.                             DEUTERONOMY.
        Oh.
                     And be thou his help from enemies.
           8                  And of Levi he said
                     Assign ye to Levi his manifestations,
                     And his truth to this man for the Holy One
                      Whom they tried at Temptation.
                     Whom they reviled at the water of Contradiction.
           9                  With regard to him who saith to his father and to his
                                   mother
                     I have not beheld thee,
                      And hath not acknowledged his brethren,
                      And hath renounced his own children,
                      He it is who hath observed thine Oracles
                      And diligently kept thy covenant.
         10                   Let them explain thy rules of rectitude for Jacob
                      And thy law for Israel
                      Let them lay incense continually,
                      When thou art angry, on thine altar.
         11                   Bless,           Lord, his endeavours,
                              And accept the works of his hands.
                              Pierce the loins of enemies,
                              Who have risen up against him :
                               And let them who hate him never rise up.
         12                        And of Benjamin he said,
                               Beloved ! He shall dwell securely under the Lord.
                               God overshadoweth him continually,
                              And hath taken up his rest between his shoulders.
         13                        And of Joseph he said,
                          His land is a special blessing of the Lord
                          On account of heavenly seasons and dew,
                          And on account of abysses of fountains from beneath,
         14               And on account of the productions, in due season
                               Of the sun's revolutions and the changes of the moon,
         15                        As his land of plenty is beautified
                               With summits of ancient mountains
                              And with summits of everlasting hills ;
         16                    So may the things acceptable
                               To him who appeared in the bush,
                               Come upon the head of Joseph ;
                               He indeed is glorified
                                                                                                  ;

                               In being the head over brothers.
           17                  His beauty is that of a firstling bull,
                               His horns are the horns of an Unicorn,
                               With these he will push the nations at once,
                               Even from the limits of the land.
                               These are the myriads of Ephraim ;
                               And these the thousands of Manasses.
           18                      And of Zabulon he said,
                               Rejoice,           Zabulon, in thine outgoings
                               And let Issachar rejoice in his abodes.
           19                      They shall utterly root out nations.
                               And there you shall invoke,
                               And there offer the sacrifice of righteousness.
                               For the riches of the sea shall feed thee,
                               And a commerce with the dwellers on the sea coast.
           20                      And of Gad he said
                               Blessed is he who enlargeth Gad.
                               Like a lion he lay down to rest,
                               Having broken an arm and a chief.
           21                  He took a view of his portion
                               Because land was there divided.
                               When chiefs assembled with the leaders of tribes ;
                               The Lord executed Justice
                               And determined his cause with Israel.
           22                      And of Dan he said
                               Dan is a lion's whelp ;
                               He will make excursions beyond Basan.
           23                      And of Xephthaleim he said,
                               Xephthaleim hath abundance of good things ;
                               May he be filled with blessings from the Lord !
                               He shall possess the west and the south.
           24                      And of Aser he said,
                               Aser is blessed with children,
                               He will be acceptable to his brethren.
                               He shall bathe his foot in oil,
           25                  His shoe shall be iron and brass.
                               As thy days so shall be thy strength.
           26          There is none like the God of the Beloved.
                       He who rideth on the heaven is thy helper,
                                                                         !                                  : !

                         And be is mighty to give support.
         27             The governance of God will protect thee
                        When under the power of everlasting arms.
                        He will drive out the enemy before thee,
                        Sayiug, Be devoted to destruction !
         28             And Israel shall dwell securely alone,
                        In the land of Jacob, fed with corn and wine
                        And the heaven shall drop with dew for thee.
         29             Blessed art thou,                    Israel
                        Who is like thee,                     people saved by the Lord
                        Thy helper will protect thee,
                        His sword shall be thy boast,
                        Thine enemies shall submit to thee,
                        And thou shalt ride upon their neck.
         XXXIV.                    Then Moses went up from Araboth Moab to mount
               Nabo, to the top of Phasga, which is over against Jericho, and
               the Lord shewed him all the land of Galaad, even to Dan, and
           2 all the land of Nephthaleim, and all the land of Ephraim, and
               Manasses, and all the land of Juda, even to the farther sea, and
          3 the wilderness, and the country around Jericho, the city of palm
          4 trees, even to Segor.                       And the Lord said to Moses, This is the
               land which I solemnly promised to Abraham, and Isaak, and
               Jacob, saying, To your seed I will give it.                                            I have pointed it
               out to thine eyes, but thou shalt not go thither.
          5          So Moses the servant of the Lord died, by the command
          6 of the Lord, in jthe land of Moab ; and he was buried at Gai
               near the house of Phogor.                             But none knoweth his sepulchre at
               this day.
          7          Though Moses was an hundred and twenty years old, his
          8 eyes were not dim, nor was his natural strength abated.                                                           And
              the children of Israel mourned for Moses, in Araboth Moab,
          9 by the Jordan, over against Jericho, thirty days.                                                Andwhen the
              days of Imourning for Moses were fulfilled, as Joshua son of
              Nave was filled with a spirit of wisdom, (for Moses had laid his
              hands upon him) the children of Israel hearkened to him, and
        10 did as the Lord commanded Moses.                                             But there no more arose
              a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to
              face, in all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to do
              in the land of Egypt, on Pharao and his servants, and on all his
                     vol. i.                                        z z

            land, the great miracles, and the strong hand, which Moses ex-
            hibited in the sisrht of all Israel.
                                        JOSHUA.
        I.      After the death of Moses, the Lord spoke to Joshua, son of
         2 Nave, the lieutenant of Moses, saying, My servant Moses is
            dead, now therefore arise, and cross the Jordan, thou and all
         3 the people, into the land which I give them.           Every place, on
           which you tread with the sole of your feet, I will give you, as
         4 I said to Moses.      The wilderness, and yonder Antilibanus, to
           the river, the great river Euphrates, and to the farthest sea, at
         5 the setting of the sun, shall be your boundaries.           Not a man
           shall withstand you all the clays of thy life.      As I was with Mo-
         6 ses, so will I be with thee.    I will never leave thee, nor forsake
           thee.   Be strong and of good courage ; for thou shalt parcel out
           to this people the land, which I solemnly promised their fa-
        7 thers to give to them.        Therefore be strong, and courageous,
           to watch, and to do as my servant Moses commanded.                 Thou
        8 must not deviate from them, to the right or to the left.            That
           thou mayst clearly understand all that thou art to do,- the book
           of the Law must never be out of thy mouth.           Thou must study
           it day and night, that thou mayst know how to do all that are
           written. Then shalt thou be prospered ; and thou wilt make thy
           ways prosperous ; and then thou shalt have a good understand-
        9 ing.    Behold I ^have commanded thee ; be strong and coura-
           geous :   fear not, nor be dismayed ; for the Lord thy God is
           with thee withersoever thou goest.
       10      Upon this Joshua gave orders to the officers of the people,
           saying ; Go through the camp of the people, and give them or-
       11 ders, saying, Prepare all necessary provisions ; for in three days
           you are to cross the Jordan, to go in and take possession of the
       12 land which the Lord the God of your fathers giveth you.            Then
           Joshua said to Reuben, and Gad, and to the half of the tribe
       13 of Manasses, Remember what Moses the servant of the Lord
           commanded you saying; The Lord your God hath given you
        14 rest, and hath given you this land.         Let your wives, and your
            children, andj your cattle abide in the land which he hath given
            you ; but you, all your able bodied men, well equipt, shall cross
                                                                                                      ;
       Ch. IT.                                 JOSHUA.
            over before your brethren, and assist them ; until the Lord
       15 our God shall give your brethren rest, as well as you ; and un-
           til they possess the land which the Lord our God giveth them.
           Then you shall return, every one to his possession, which Mo-
           ses gave you on the east side of the Jordan.
      16        Thereupon they answered and said to Joshua, All that thou
           commandest we will do.                  And wherever thou sendest us we
           will go.      As we have hearkened to Moses in all things, so will
      17 we hearken to thee.               Let but the Lord our God be with thee,
      18 as he was with Moses, and whosoever shall disobey thee, and
           not hearken to all thy commands which thou shalt give him
           let him be put to death.             But be thou strong and courageous.
      II.        Now Joshua son of Nave had sent from Sattin two young-
           men to spy, saying, Go up, and take a view of the land, and
           particularly of Jericho.             And the two young men, having set
           out, entered Jericho, and went to the house of a harlot,
        2 whose name was Kahab, and lodged there.                              And news being
           carried to the' king of Jericho, saying, Some men of the chil-
        3 dren of Israel are come here to spy the land, the king of Je-
           richo sent a message to Kahab, saying, Bring out the men,
           who came to thy house to night ; for they are come to spy the
       4 land.        Now the woman had taken the two men, and hid them :
       5 so she spoke to the messengers, saying, The men came to me
           but at dark, when the gate was shutting, the men went out, and
        6 I do not know where they are gone.                          Pursue them : perhaps
           you [may overtake them.                Now she had taken them up to the
           top of the house, and concealed them under flax, which was
       7 piled up for her on the top of the house.                       And the men pursu-
           ed them by the way to the Jordan, to the fords, and the gate
       8 was shut.          So when the pursuers were gone after them, she
           went up to the men, on the top of the house, before they had
       9 gone to sleep, and said to them, I know that the Lord hath
           given you this land ; for the dread of you is fallen upon us :
      10 for we have heard that the Lord God dried up the Bed sea on
           your account, when you came out of Egypt, and all that he
           hath done to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the
           borders of the Jordan, to Seon and Og, whom you have utterly
      11 destroyed : and, upon hearing these tilings, we became faint
           hearted, and there was no spirit in any of us because of you.
      Ck. III.                   JOSHUA.
         Since, then, the Lord your God is God in heaven above, and
      12 in the earth beneath, swear now to me by the Lord your God,
         because I shew mercy to you, that you will shew mercy to my
      13 father's house ; and that you will save alive my father's house-
         hold, my mother, and my brothers, and all my family, and all
         that belong to them, and that you will deliver my soul from
      14 death.  And the men said to her, Our life for yours even to
         death.  Then she said to them. When the Lord delivereth up
         to you this city, you will deal mercifully and truly with me.
      15 So she lowered them down through a window.     Now she said
      16 to them, Flee to the mountains, lest the pursuers meet you,
         and hide yourself there three days, until they who are in
         pursuit of you have returned, and afterwards you may go
      17 your way.   And the men said to her, We are sincere in the
      18 oath which we have sworn to thee. Behold when we enter any
         part of the city, thou shalt put up this signalâ€”Thou shalt tye
          this scarlet rope to the window, through which thou shalt have
         let us down ; and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother,
          and thy brothers, and all thy father's household, home to thy
      19 house.   And it shall be that whoever goeth out of the door of
          thy house, into the street, shall incur the guilt of his own death,
          and we shall be clear of blame in regard to this oath which we
          have sworn to thee. But for all who are with thee in the house
      20 we will be answerable.  But if any one injure us, or if thou dis-
          close these our terms, we shall be clear of this oath to thee.
      21 And she said to them, Let it be as you say.   So she dismis-
      22 sed them, and they went away, and came to the hilly country,
          and stayed there three days. And the pursuers examined all
      23 the roads, but did not find them.  Then the two young men
          turned, and came down from the mountain, and crossed over
          to Joshua son of Nave, and told him all that had happened to
      24 them.   And they said to him, Because the Lord hath delivered
          up all that land into our hands, therefore all the inhabitants of
      III.  the land are in the utmost consternation because of us. There-
          upon Joshua arose early next morning, and removed from Sat-
          tin ;and having come to the Jordan, they halted there some
        2 time before they crossed. And after three days the officers
          went through the camp, and gave a charge to the people, say-
        3 ing, When you see the Ark of the covenant of the Lord our
                                                                                                                          ;
               III.
        Ch.                                            JOSHUA.
              God, and our priests, and the Levites carrying it, you shall
          4 remove from your places, and march after it.                                       But let there be
              a considerable distance between you and it.                                       You shall keep
              at the distance of about two thousand cubits.                                       Yuu must not
              come near it, that you may know the way you are to march
          5 for you have never heretofore gone this way.                                            Then Joshua
              said to the people, Purify yourselves against to-morrow ; for
          6 to-morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.                                               And when
              Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant of
              the Lord, and march before the people ; and the priests had
          7 taken up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and were march-
              ing before the people, the Lord said to Joshua, This day I be-
              gin to exalt thee in the sight of all the children of Israel, that
             they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with
          8 thee.          Now therefore command the priests who are carrying
              the ark of the covenant, and say, Soon as you are come to a
              part of the water of the Jordan, you shall halt at the Jordan.
          9 Then Joshua said to the sons of Israel, Draw near, and hear
        10 the word of the Lord our God.                                 By this you will know that
              the living God is among you, and that he will surely root out
              from before you the Chananite, and the Chettite, and the Phe-
              rezite, and the Evite, and the Amorite, and Gergasite, and the
        11 Jebusite.            Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the
        13 whole earth is about to cross the Jordan ; and it shall come to
              pass, that when the feet of the priests who are carrying the ark
              of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth shall rest in the
              water of the Jordan, the water of the Jordan shall fail, and the wa-
        14 ter which is coming down shall be stopped.                                   So the people remov-
              ed from their tents to cross the Jordan, and the priests carried
        15 the Ark of the covenant of the Lord before the people.                                                  And
              soon as the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant
              came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests, who were
              carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord, were dipped
              into a part of the water of the Jordan, though the Jordan
              overflowed all its banks, as in the days of wheat harvest,
        16 yet the waters coming down from above stopped.                                                         They
              stopped like one solid mass, reaching a great way back,
              even to a part of Kariathiarim ; and the water below flowed down
              into the sea of Araba, the salt sea, until it was entirely gone,
                                 JOSHUA.
      Ch. IV.
      17 and the people stood over against Jericho.     Then the priests
         who carried the xlrk of the covenant of the Lord, stood on dry
         ground, and all the children of Israel crossed over on dry
         ground, until all the people had finished crossing the Jordan.
      IV.     And when all the people had entirely crossed the Jordan,
       2 the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying, Take men from among the
       3 people, one from every tribe, and give them orders.   And you
         shall take up, out of the middle of the Jordan, twelve smooth
         stones, and carry them with you, and place them in your en-
       4 campment, wherever you encamp to night.       So Joshua called
         out twelve men of eminent dignity from among the children
       5 of Israel, one from every tribe, and said to them, Go on before
         me in the presence of the Lord, into the middle of the Jordan,
         and let every one take up thence a stone, and carry it on his
         shoulders, according to the number of the twelve tribes of Is-
       6 rael ; that they may be to you an everlasting memorial ; that
         when thy son shall hereafter ask thee, saying, What are these
       7 stones to us ? thou mayst explain them to thy son, and say,
         Because the river Jordan dried up at the presence of the Ark of
         the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth, when it crossed it,
         therefore you shall have these stones for an everlasting memo-
       8 rial for the children of Israel.Accordingly these sons of Israel
         did as the Lord commanded Joshua, and having taken up
         twelve stones, out of the midst of the Jordan, as the Lord com-
         manded Joshua, when the Israelites had done crossing, they
         carried them with them to the place of encampmeut, and de-
       9 posited them there ; and Joshua caused twelve other stones to
         be placed in the Jordan, in the very spot under the feet of
         the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and
      10 they are there at this day. Now the priests, who carried the ark
         of the covenant, stood in the Jordan, until Joshua had executed
         all that the Lord commanded him to declare to the people.
      11 And the people hasted and crossed over.     And when all the
         people had done crossing, then the Ark of the covenant of the
      12 Lord crossed over, with the stones before them.  And the Eeu-
         benites, and the Gadites, and the half of the tribe of Manasses,
         crossed over well armed before the children of Israel, as Mo-
      13 ses had commanded them.      Forty thousand, well equipped for
         war, crossed over before the Lord, in battle array, to the city
     Ch. V.                        JOSHUA.
     14 Jericho.   On that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight
         of the whole race of Israel, and they feared him, as they did
     15 Moses all the days of his life,     Now when the Lord spoke to
     16 Joshua, saying, Command the priests who carry the ark of the
         covenant ofthe testimony of the Lord, to come up out of the Jor-
     17 dan; And Joshua had commanded the priests, saying, Come
     18 up out of the Jordan, it came to pass that as soon as the priests
         who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord came up out
         of the Jordan, and had set their feet on the land, the water of
         the Jordan rushed impetuously to its place, and overflowed all
         its banks, as it did before.
     19     Now the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth
         day of the first month, and the children of Israel encamped at
     20 Galgala, on the eastern border of Jericho ; and Joshua set up
        at Galgala, the twelve stones which he had taken out of the
     21 Jordan, and said, When your children ask you, saying, What
     22 stones are these ? Tell your children that Israel crossed that
     23 Jordan on dry ground, the Lord our God having dried up the
        water of the Jordan before them, until they crossed over, as
        the Lord our God had done to the Ked sea, which the Lord
     24 our God dried up before us, until we passed through it, that
        all the nations of the earth might know, that the power of the
        Lord is great, and that you may worship the Lord our God by
        every thing which you do.
     V.     Now when the kings of the Amorites, who were on the
        border of the Jordan, and the kings of Phoenicia, who were on
        the sea coast, heard that the Lord God had dried up the river
        Jordan before the Israelites, when they crossed, their hearts
        were melted, and they were struck with consternation, and
      2 there was no spirit in them because of the Israelites.       And at
        that time the Lord said to Joshua, Make thee stone knives of
        the hardest flint, and having again a fixed abode, circumcise
      3 the children of Israel.   So Joshua made sharp knives of stone,
        and circumcised the children of Israel at the place called Hill
        offoreskins.    And in this manner Joshua purified the children
      4 of Israelâ€”All who had been born on the way, and all who had
        formerly been uncircumcised, when they came out of Egypt,
      5 all these Joshua circumcised ; for Israel had been led about for-
      6 ty two years in the wilderness of Mabdaritis, therefore the most
       Ch. VI.                  JOSHUA.
         of them were uncircurncised, being the children of those warri-
         ors who came out of the land of Egypt, who disobeyed the
         commands of God, and to whom he denounced, that they
         should not see the land which the Lord solemnly promised
         their fathers that he would giveâ€”a land flowing with milk and
       7 honey ; and instead of them he raised up these their children,
         whom Joshua circumcised, because, being born on the way,
       8 they were uncircurncised. And being now circumcised, they
         were to continue there at rest, in the camp, until they were
       9 healed. And the Lord said to Joshua son of Nave, This day
         I have taken away from you the reproach of Egypt.So he call-
      10 ed the name of that place Galgala.And on the fourteenth of
         the same month, towards evening, the children of Israel pre-
      11 pared the passover, on the confines of Jericho, in the plain of
         Jordan, and ate of the corn of the land, unleavened cakes and
      12 parched corn. On that very day, after they had eaten the corn
         of the land, the manna ceased, and there was no more a sup-
         ply of manna for the children of Israel.So they foraged the
         country of the Phoenicians that year.
      13    Now when Joshua was by Jericho, he raised his eyes, and
         saw a man standing before him, with a drawn sword in his hand,
      14 upon which Joshua, advancing, said to him, Art thou one of
         us ' or of our enemies ?And he said to him, I am the captain
      15 general of the host of the Lord, just arrived.At this Joshua
         prostrated himself, with his face to the ground, and said to
         him, My lord, what clost thou command thy servant?   And
         the Lord's captain general said to Joshua, Loose the sandals
         from thy feet, for the place on which thou didst stand is holy
      VI.    ground.  (Now Jericho was shut up, and barricadoed, so
       2 that none came out of it, nor went in.)Then the Lord said to
         Joshua, Behold, I deliver into thy hand, Jericho, and the king
       3 thereof, who is in it, and the mighty men of valour.Therefore
       4 array thou the warriors around it.And when you blow the
       5 trumpets, let all the people at the same time shout ; and upon
         their shouting, the walls of the city will fall of their own ac-
         cord ; and all the people shall enter, every one straight forward
         into the city.
       7    Thereupon Joshua son of Nave went to the priests, and
         spoke to them, saying, Order the people to march round, and
     Ch. VI.                       JOSHUA.
         encompass the city, and let the warriors march armed before
      8 the Lord ; and let the seven priests, who have the seven holy
         trumpets, march also before the Lord, and blow a long blast.
      9 And let the ark of the covenant of the Lord accompany them.
         Let the warriors march before, and the priests follow in the
         rear, after the ark of the covenant of the Lord, blowing the
     10 trumpets.    Then Joshua gave a charge to the people, saying,
         Shout not, nor let any one hear your voice, till the day when
     11 He shall command you to shout.         Then you shall shout.     So
         when the ark of the covenant had gone round, it straightway
     12 returned to the camp, and lodged there.        And on the second
         day Joshua arose, early in the morning, and the priests took up
     13 the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the seven priests with
         the seven trumpets, marched on before the Lord and after them
         came the warriors, and all the rest of the multitude followed
        the ark of the covenant of the Lord.     And the priests sounded
     14 the trumpets; and all the multitude compassed the city six
        times, very near, and returned again to the camp.        Thus they
     15 did six days.   But on the seventh dayâ€”they arose very early,
     16 and went round the city that day seven times.      And, at the se-
        venth round, the priests sounded the trumpets, and Joshua said
         to the Israelites, Shout, for the Lord hath delivered up the city
     17 to you.   And this city shall be an Anathema.      It, and all that
        are in it, shall be devoted to the Lord of Sabaoth ; save Kahab
        the harlot. Her you shall save alive, and all that are in her house.
     18 But be you very careful to abstain from the Anathema, lest
        peradventure you through covetousness, take something of
        what is devoted, and make the camp of the Israelites an Ana-
     19 thema, and destroy us.     All the silver, and the gold, and the
        brass, and the iron, shall be consecrated to the Lord, and car-
     20 ried to the Lord's treasury.      Then the priests     sounded the
        trumpets ; and when the people heard the trumpets, all the peo-
        ple together uttered a great, loud, and continued shout, where-
        upon the whole wall round about fell, and all the people went
        up into the city.
     21     Now when Joshua devoted it, and all that were in it, men
        and women, young and old, ox and ass, to the edge of the
     22 sword, he said to the two young men who had been sent as
        spies, Go to the house of the woman, and bring her out thence,
            vol. I.                    3 A
       Ch. YIL                      JOSHUA.
       23 with all that she hath.    And when the two young men, who
          had spied the city had gone to the house of the woman, and
          had brought out Rahab the harlot, and her father, and her mo-
          ther, and her brothers, and her kindred, and all that were with
       24 her, and placed them without the camp of Israel, the city was
          burned with fire, with all that were in it, save the silver, and
          gold, and the brass, and iron, which they gave to be carried
      25 to the treasury of the Lord.    So Joshua saved Rahab the harlot,
          and all her father's household alive.  And at this day they dwell
          among Israel, because she concealed the spies whom Joshua
      26 had sent to spy Jericho.     And on that day Joshua uttered an
          imprecation before the Lord, saying, Cursed be the man who
          shall rebuild this city. With his first born let him lay the foun-
          dation, and with his youngest son erect its gates.
      27     Thus the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame spread
      VII.     through all the land.   But the children of Israel committed
          a great trespass.   They set apart for themselves some of the
          Anathema.    Achar son of Charmi, son of Zambri, son of Za-
          ra, of the tribe of Juda, had taken some of what was devoted,
          and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of
       2 Israel ; so that when Joshua sent men to Gai, which is over
       3 against Baithel, saying, Take a view of Gai ; and the men had
          gone up, and viewed Gai, and returned to Joshua, and said to
          him, Let not the whole people go up, but let only about two
          or three thousand go up, and storm the city ; thou needest not
       4 lead the whole people thither, for they are few in number ; and
          about three thousand men had gone up, they fled before the
       5 men of Gai ; and the men of Gai slew of them about thirty six
          men, and pursued them from the gate, and drove them from
       6 the steep.    Whereupon the heart of the people was dismayed,
          and became like water; and Joshua rent his clothes.           Now
          when Joshua had prostrated himself, with his face on the
          ground, before the Lord until evening, he and the elders of
          Israel, and they had put dust on their heads, Joshua said, Alas,
       7     Lord !  Why hath thy servant caused this people to cross
          the Jordan, to deliver them up to the Amorite to destroy us ?
       8 Should we have tarried, and dwelt on the other side of the Jor-
          dan ?   What can I say, seeing Israel hath turned back from
       9 before his enemy ?     When the Chananite, and all the inhabit-
                               JOSHUA.
    Ch. VII.
        ants of this land hear this, they will encompass us, and drive
     10 us from this land. What then wilt thou do in respect to thy
        great name ?  Thereupon the Lord said to Joshua, Arise ; why
    11 hast thou fallen on thy face ?  This people hath sinned, and
        transgressed the covenant which I made with them.     They
        have stolen some of what was devoted, and put it among their
     12 stuff; therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before the
        face of their enemies.They shall turn back before their ene-
        mies, because they are become devoted.   I will no more be
       with you, unless you remove the Anathema from among
     13 you.  Arise, hallow the people, and order them to hallow
        themselves, against to-morrow.Thus saith the Lord the God
        of Israel, The Anathema is among you.     You cannot stand
        before your enemies, until you remove the Anathema from
     14 among you.   You shall therefore all assemble to-morrow, by
        tribes; and whatever tribe the Lord shall point out, you shall
        present it by communities ; and whatever community the Lord
        shall point out, you shall present it by houses ; and whatever
        house the Lord shall point out, you shall present it man by
     15 man ; and whoever is pointed out, he shall be burned with fire
        and all that he hath, because he hath transgressed the covenant
        of the Lord, and committed iniquity in Israel.
     16    Accordingly Joshua arose early in the morning, and brought
        forward the people by tribes, and the tribe of Juda was pointed
     17 out. And when it was presented by communities, the commu-
     18 nity of the Zaraites was pointed out ; and when it was presented
        man by man, Achar son of Zambri, son of Zara, was pointed
     19 out.  Whereupon Joshua said to Achar, Give glory this day
        to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession, and tell me
     20 what thou hast done, and conceal it not from me. And Achar
        answered Joshua, and said, I have indeed sinned before the
     21 Lord, the God of Israel.  Thus and thus have I done.  I saw,
        among the spoil, a piece of tissue, and two hundred didrachms
        of silver, and an ingot of gold, of about fifty didrachms, and I
        coveted them, and took them, and behold they are hid in my
     22 tent, and the silver is hid under them.ThenJoshua sent messen-
        gers, who ran to the tent, in the camp, and the things were hid
     23 in his tent, and the silver under them.So they took them out of
        the tent and brought them to Joshua, and the elders of Israel
      Oh. VIII.                     JOSHUA.
      24 who laid them before the Lord.       Then Joshua took Achar, son
          of Zara, and led him up to the valley of Achor, with his sons,
          and his daughters, and his cattle, and his asses, and all his
          flocks, and his tent, and all his goods, and all the people ac-
      25 companied him.       And when he had led them up to Eniek-
          Achor, Joshua said to Achar, Why hast thou destroyed us ?
          The Lord destroy thee, as at this day !    Then all Israel stoned
      26 him with stones.     And when they had raised over him a great
          heap of stones, the Lord ceased from the fierceness of his an-
          ger.  For this cause he called that place Emek-Achor, which
          is its name at this day.
      VIII.      Then the Lord said to Joshua, Fear not, nor be dismay-
          ed.  Take with thee all the men who are warriors, and arise,
       2 and go up to Gai.     Behold I have delivered into thy hands, the
          king of Gai, and his land; and thou shalt treat Gai, as thou
          hast treated Jericho, and its king ; but the plunder of the cattle
          thou shalt take for thyself.   Lay thee an ambush for the city,
       3 behind it.    So Joshua arose, and all the warriors, to go up
          against Gai.    And Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty
       4 men of valour, and sent them away by night ; and he gave them
          orders, saying, Lie in ambush behind the city ; be not at a great
       5 distance from the city, and be all ready ; and I, and all the peo-
          ple who are with me, will advance to the city, and when the
          inhabitants of Gai come out to meet us, as before, we will flee
       6 from before them ; and as they come after us we will draw them
          off from the city ; for they will say, They are fleeing from us,
       7 as they did before.    Then you will rise from the ambush, and
       8 rush into the city.     Act agreeably to these orders ; behold I
       9 have commanded you.        So Joshua despatched them, and they
          went to lie in ambush, and took their station, between Baithel
      10 and Gai, on the west of Gai.         And Joshua arose early next
          morning and reviewed the people, and he and the elders went
      11 up before the people to Gai.       All the warriors went up with
          him, and marching on, came before the city, on the east side,
      12 now the ambush was on the west side of the city.          And when
      14 the king of Gai saw them, he hasted, and went out to meet
          them, straight to battle, he and all his people with him ; for he
      15 did not know that there was an ambush behind the city.            At
      16 their appearance Joshua and Israel retreated before them, and
     Ch. IX.                       JOSHUA.
         they pursued the Israelites, and were drawn off from the city.
     17 There was not a man left in Gai, who did not pursue Israel.
     18 Nay they left the city open, and pursued Israel.  Then the Lord
         said to Joshua, Stretch forth thy hand, with the spear in thy
         hand, towards the city ; for into thy hands I have delivered it,
         and the men in ambush will rise quickly from their place.    So
        Joshua stretched forth his hand, with the spear towards the
     19 city ; and the men in ambush immediately arose from their
        place.  They started up at the instant he stretched forth his
        hand, and rushed into the city ; and having taken it, they hasted
     20 and set it on fire.   And when the inhabitants of Gai looked
         back, they saw a smoke rising from the city, up to heaven,
     21 and had no where to flee, this way or that.    For when Joshua
        and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had taken the city,
        and that the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, they
     22 turned, and smote the men of Gai ; and the others issued out
        of the city to meet them, so that they were in the midst of the
        army, some being on one side, and some on the other ; and
        they smote them until there was not one left alive, nor any who
     23 escaped.   They took the king of Gai alive, and brought him to
     24 Joshua, and when the Israelites had made an end of slaying
        all that were in Gai, and all that were in the plains, and on the
        mountain, at the steep, from which at the last they had driven
        them, Joshua returned to Gai, and smote it with the edge of
     25 the sword.   Now they who fell on that day, including men and
        women, even all the inhabitants of Gai, were twelve thousand.
     27 Over and above the spoils which were in the city, the Israel-
        ites took all the prey for themselves, according to the command
     28 of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Joshua.         Then Joshua
        burned the city with fire, and made it an uninhabitable heap
     28 forever, as at this day.  And he hanged the king of Gai on a
        gibbet ; and he continued on the gibbet till the evening.   But,
        at the setting of the sun, Joshua gave orders, and they took
        down his body from the gibbet, and threw it into a pit ; and
        raised over it a heap of stones, which remaineth to this day.
     IX.     When the kings of the Amorites, who dwelt on the border
        of the Jordan, and those in the hilly country, and those in the
        plain, and those along the coast of the great sea, and those bor-
        dering on Antilibanus, namely the Chettites, and the Chanan-
                                    JOSHUA.
      Oh. IX.
          ites,and the Pherezites, and the Evites, and the Aniorites,
       2 and the Gergasites, and the Jebusites, heard of these things,
          they assembled together to attack Joshua and Israel, all at the
          same time.
      VIII. 30      In the mean while Joshua built an altar to the Lord
      31 the God of Israel, on mount Garizin, as Moses the servant of
          the Lord commanded Israel, as it is written in the law of Mo-
          ses, an altar of unwrought stones which iron had never struck,
          and offered thereon whole burnt offerings to the Lord, and a
      32 sacrifice of thanksgiving.   And when Joshua had written on the
          stones the repetition of the law of Moses, in the presence of the
      33 children of Israel, then all Israel with their elders, and their judg-
          es, and their under officers, marched out, some on one side, and
          some on the other side of the Ark, which was at a distance be-
          fore them ; and the priests and the Levites carried the Ark of
          the covenant of the Lord ; and the proselyte, as well as the
          home born, attended.     One half were on mount Garizin, and
          the other half on mount Gaibal, as Moses the servant of the
      34 Lord commanded; first to bless the people; and afterwards, as
          Joshua read all the words of that law, the blessings, and the cur-
          ses, accordiDg  to all that were written in the law of Moses.
      35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded Joshua,
          which Joshua did not read in the hearing of all the congrega-
          tion of Israel, to the men and women, and to the children, and
          the proselytes who sojourned with Israel.
       IX. 3     Now when the inhabitants of Gabaon heard all that the
          Lord had done to Jericho, and Gai, they acted with subtilty.
        4 They went and furnished themselves with provisions, and
          made other suitable preparations, and taking old bags on their
        5 shoulders, and old skins of wine which were cracked, and
          bound up, and shoes for their feet, the under part of which
          were hollow, and the upper part old and clouted, and the gar-
          ments they put on beiug worn out, and the bread for their
        6 journey dry, mouldy, and worm eaten, they came to Joshua,
          to the camp of Israel, at Galgala, and said to Joshua and Israel,
          We are come from a far distant land, now therefore make a
        7 covenant with us.    And the children of Israel said to the Chor-
          rite, Perhaps thou dwellest near me ; how then can I make a
        8 covenant with thee? Thereupon they said to Joshua, We are thy
     Ch. IX.                      JOSHUA.
        servants.  And Joshua said to them, Whence are you?          And
      9 whence come you?       xVnd they said, Thy servants are come
        from a very far distant country, because of the name of the Lord
        thy God ; for we have heard of his name, and of all that he hath
     10 done in Egypt, and what he hath done to the kings of the Amo-
        rites, who were on the border of the Jordan, to Seon king of
        the Amorites, and to Og the king of Basan, who dwelt at As-
     11 teroth and Edrain.    At the news of which, our elders and all
        the inhabitants of our land spoke to us saying, Take for your-
        selves provisions for the journey, and go and meet them, and
        say to them, We are thy servants ; make a covenant with us.
     12 These loaves we took hot for our journey, on the day we set
        out to come to you ; but now they are dry, and become mouldy ;
     13 these skins of wine were filled new ; but they are cracked; and
        these our garments, and our shoes, are worn out with the length
     14 of the journey.   Then the rulers took some of their provisions,
     15 and did not consult the Lord.     And Joshua made peace with
        them, and they entered into a covenant with them to save their
     16 lives ; and the chiefs of the congregation swore to them.     But
        three days after they had entered into covenant with them, they
        heard that they were in the neighbourhood, and dwelt close by
     17 them.    Whereupon the children of Israel removed, and came
        to their cities.  Now their cities were Gabaon, and Kephira,
     18 and Berot, and the cities of Jarim ; But the children of Israel
        did not make war on them, because all the chiefs had sworn
     19 to them by the Lord the God of Israel.     When all the congre-
        gation murmured at the chiefs, the chiefs said to all the con-
        gregation, We have sworn to them by the Lord the God of
     20 Israel ; now therefore we cannot touch them.    This we will do.
        We will let them live and protect them ; that there may be no
        wrath against us because of the oath which we have sworn to
     21 them.   They shall live ; but they shall be hewers of wood, and
        drawers of water for all the congregation, as the chiefs have
     22 said to them.   For Joshua had called them, and said to them,
        Why did you impose upon me saying, We are far distant from
     23 thee, seeing you are our nearest neighbour ?   Now therefore you
        are cursed, and not one of you shall escape servitudeâ€”from
        being a hewer of wood, and a drawer of water, for me and my
     24 God.    And they answered Joshua saying, We were told all that
           X.                      JOSHUA.
       Ch.
          the Lord thy God commanded his servant Moses, to give yon
          this land, and to extirpate us, and all the inhabitants thereof
          from before you, therefore we were in great terror for our lives
       25 because of you, and we did this.    And now behold we are in
          your power, deal with us as you please, and as it seemeth good
       26 to you.  So they dealt with them in this manner, and Joshua
          saved them that day out of the hand of the Israelites, and they
      27 did not destroy them.     And on that day Joshua made them
          hewers of wood, and drawers of water, for the whole congre-
          gation, and for the altar of God. For this cause the inhabitants
          of Gabaon are hewers of wood, and drawers of water, for the
          altar of God, even at this day, and are to be so for the place
          which the Lord will chuse.
      X.      Now when Adonibezek, the king of Jerusalem heard that
          Joshua had taken Gai, and utterly destroyed it ; (As they had
          done to Jericho, and the king thereof, so had they done to Gai,
          and its king) and that the inhabitants of Gabaon had gone over
        2 to Joshua and Israel ; (Now there was a great dread on account
          of them, for he knew that Gabaon was a great city, like one of
          the chief cities, and that all the inhabitants thereof were men
        3 of valour ;) Adonibezek, the king of Jerusalem sent to Elam,
          king of Chebron, and to Phedon, king of Jerimuth, and to
          Jephtha, king of Lachis, and to Dabin, king of Odollam, say-
        4 ing, Haste, come up to me, and help me, and let us smite Ga-
        5 baon, for they have revolted to Joshua and the Israelites.   So
          the five kings of the Jebusites, the king of Jerusalem, and the
          king of Chebron, and the king of Jerimuth, and the king of
          Lachis, and the king of Odollam, went up, they and their peo-
        6 pie, and encamped about Gabaon, and besieged it.     Thereupon
          the inhabitants of Gabaon sent to Joshua, to the camp of Israel,
          at Galgala, saying, Slack not thy hands from thy servants.
          Come up to us with all speed, and help us, and deliver us ; for
          all the kings of the Amorites who inhabit the hilly country are
       7 assembled against us.     So Joshua went up from Galgala, he
        8 and all the people of war with him, every man of valour.   And
          the Lord said to Joshua, Be not afraid of them, for I have de-
        9 livered them into thy hands.  There shall not one of them be left
          before you.  And when Joshua came upon them suddenly, hav-
      10 ing marched all night from Galgala, the Lord struck them with
     Ch. X.                         JOSHUA.
         a panic, on account of the children of Israel, and the Lord
         routed them, with a great slaughter, at Gabaon.           And they
         pursued them by the way of the ascent of Oronin, and smote
     11 them even to xVzeka, and to Makeda.        And as they were fleeing
         from before Israel, at the descent of Oronin, the Lord poured
         a storm of hail stones from heaven upon them, all the way to
         Azeka; so that there were more who died by the hail stones,
     12 than the children of Israel slew with the sword in battle.       Then
         Joshua spoke to the Lord, on the day God delivered up the
         Amorite into the hand of Israel.        When he had discomfited
         them at Gabaon, and they were routed before the children of
         Israel, Joshua said, Let the sun stand over against Gabaon, and
     13 the moon over against the valley of xUlon.          So the sun stood
         still, and the moon in its stationâ€”until God executed vengeance
         on their enemies, the sun stood in the midst of heaven ; it ad-
     14 vanced not to the setting, to the end of a day.        So that there
         never was such a day before, nor after it such an instance of
         God's hearkening to man.      Because the Lord fought conjointly
     16 with Israel, therefore the five kings fled, and hid themselves
     17 in the cave at Makeda.       And when it was told Joshua, saying,
     18 The five kings are found hidden in the cave at Makeda, -lo-
         shua said, Roll stones on the mouth of the cave, and set men
     19 to keep watch over them ; but as for you, halt not ; pursue
         your enemies, and attack their rear, and suffer them not to
         enter their cities ; for the Lord our God hath delivered them
     20 into our hands.      And when Joshua, and all Israel, had made
         an end of slaughtering them till they were utterly routed, and
     21 those who had escaped had got into fortified cities, all the peo-
         ple returned safe to Joshua to Makeda, and there was not a
         murmur on the tongue of any one among the children of Israel.
     22 Then Joshua said, Open the cave, and bring out the five kings
     23 out of the cave.      So they brought the five kings out of the
         cave; the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Chebron, and the
         king of Jerimuth, and the king of Lachis, and the king of
     24 Odollam.     And when they had brought them out to Joshua,
         he called together ail Israel, namely the chief commanders of
         the army who went out with him, and said to them, Go near,
         and put your feet on the necks of those men.         And when they
     25 had gone near, and put their feet on their necks, Joshua said
             vol. i.                   3 B
                                      JOSHUA.
        Ch. X.
           to them, Fear them not, nor be dismayed.         Be strong and of
           good courage ; for thus will the Lord do to all your enemies,
        26 against whom you fight.      So Joshua slew them, and hanged
           them on five gibbets, and they hung on the gibbets till even-
        27 ing.  And at the setting of the sun Joshua gave orders, and they
           took them down from the gibbets, and threw them into the
       28 cave, and rolled stones on the cave, which still remain.        Now
           on that day they took Makeda, and smote it with the edge of
           the sword, and utterly destroyed every thing therein which
           breathed.   There was not one left who escaped or fled.         And
           when they had done to the king of Makeda as they did to the
       29 king of Jericho, Joshua, and all Israel with him, marched from
       30 Makeda to Lebna and besieged it; and the Lord delivered it
           into the hands of Israel, and they took it and the king thereof,
           and smote it with the edge of the sword, and every thing in it
           which had breath.     There was not one left in it who escaped,
       31 or fled.   And when they had done to the king thereof as they
           did to the king of Jericho, Joshua, and all Israel with him,
           marched from Lebna to Lachis, and encamped about it, and
       32 besieged it.    And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of
           Israel ; and they took it on the second day, and smote it with
           the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed it as they had
       33 done Lebna.     At that time Elam, king of Gazer, having come
           up to assist Lachis, Joshua smote him with the edge of the
       34 sword, till there was none of them left who escaped, or fled.  Then
           Joshua, and all Israel with him, went from Lachis to Odollam,
       35 and encamped about it, and besieged it.        And the Lord deli-
           vered it into the hand of Israel, and they took it that day, and
       36 smote it with the edge of the sword.      And when they had slain
           every living soul therein, as they had done at Lachis, Joshua,
           and all Israel with him, went to Chebron, and encamped about
           it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and every living
       37 soul therein.   Not one escaped.     As they had done to Odollam,
       38 they utterly destroyed it, and all that were in it.    Then Joshua,
           and all Israel, wheeled round to Dabir, and encamped about it,
       39 and took it, and the king thereof, and the villages thereof.    And
           he smote it with the edge of the sword.     And they utterly de-
           stroyed it, and every soul in it.   They did not leave one alive.
           As they had done to Chebron, and its king, so they did to Da-
                              JOSHUA.
    Ch. XL
    40 bir, and its king.Thus did Joshua smite all the hilly country,
       and Nageb, and the plain, and Asedoth, and the kings thereof.
       They did not leave one of them alive.They utterly destroyed
       every one who breathed the breath of life, as the Lord God of
    41 Israel had commanded.   From Kades-barne to Gaza, Joshua
       smote at one time all the land of Gosom, quite to Gabaon, all
       their kings, and their land, for the Lord the God of Israel
       fought for Israel.
    XL     Now when Jabis, king of Azor, heard this, he sent to Jo-
     2 bab king of Maram, and to the king of Symoon, and to the king
       of Aziph, and to the kings who bordered on great Sidon, to
     3 the hilly country, and to Araba over against Keneroth, and to
       the plain, and to Phenaeddor, and to the Chananites, on the
       eastern shore of the sea, and to the Amorites, on the sea shore,
       and to the Chettites, and the Pherezites, and the Jebusites, on
       the mountain, and to the Evites, and to those at the foot of
     4 Aermon, to the land of Massuma; and they, and their kings
       with them, came out like the sand of the sea for multitude,
     5 with horses and chariots in great abundance. And when all
       these kings had assembled, and formed a junction, and en-
       camped at the water of Maron to fight against Israel ; the Lord
     6 said to Joshua, Be not afraid of them, for to-morrow, about
       this time, I will deliver them up vanquished before Israel.
       Thou shalt hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with
     7 fire. So Joshua and all the warriors came upon them suddenly,
       at the water of Maron, and fell upon them in the hilly coun-
     8 try : and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Israel, and
       they pursued them with slaughter, to great Sidon, and to Ma-
       seron, and to the plains of Massoch, eastward, and hewed them
     9 down till there was none of them left alive.And Joshua did to
       them as the Lord commanded him.      Their horses he ham-
    10 stringed ; and their chariots he burned with fire.And at that
       time Joshua turned back, and took Asor, and the king thereof.
    11 (Now Asor was formerly the head of all these kingdoms.)And
       they slew every living soul in it, with the sword, and utterly
    12 destroyed all, so that there was not one left in it alive.And
       they burned Asor with fire.Then Joshua took all the cities of
       those kingdoms, and the kings thereof, and smote them with
       the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them, as Moses
       Ch. XII.                    JOSHUA.
       13 the servant of the Lord had commanded.       (But Israel did not
          burn any of the cities which were built on lofty situations, ex-
      14 cept Asor ; this alone Israel burned ;) And the Israelites took
          all the spoils thereof for themselves, and exterminated the in-
          habitants with the edge of the sword, until they destroyed them.
       15 They did not leave a breathing soul of them.       As the Lord
          commanded his servant Moses, and as Moses gave it in charge
          to Joshua, so Joshua did.   He left nothing undone of all that
      16 Moses commanded him.       So Joshua took all the hilly country,
          and all the land of Xageb, and all the land of Gosom, and the
       17 plain, and that to the west, and the mountain of Israel, and the
          lowlands adjoining the mountain, from mount Chelcha, and
          that which stretcheth up to Seir, even to Balagad, and the
          plains of Libanus, at the foot of mount Aermon.    He took, and
      18 smote, and slew, all the kings thereof.    Joshua indeed waged
          war against those kings for several years, so that there was not
       19 a city which Israel did not take. They took them all by battle.
      20 For the Lord permitted them to assume courage to come to
          battle with Israel, that they might be utterly destroyed, that no
          mercy might be shewn them ; but that they might be utterly
      21 destroyed, as the Lord commanded Moses.       At that time also,
          Joshua went, and rooted out the Enakims from the hilly coun-
          try, from Chebron, and from Dabir, and from Anaboth, and
          from the whole race of Israel, and from all the mountain of
       22 Juda.   Them, with their cities, Joshua destroyed.   So that, by
          means of the children of Israel, there was not one of the Ena-
          kims left, except some who were in Gaza, and in Geth, and in
       23 Aseldo.   And when Joshua had taken all the land as the Lord
          commanded Moses, he gave it for an inheritance to Israel, in
          parcels, according to their tribes ; and the land rested from war.
       XII.     Now these are the kings of the land, whom the Israelites
          slew, and whose land they possessed, on the east side of the
          Jordan, from the vale of Arnon to mount Aermon, compre-
        2 hending all the land of xlraba to the eastâ€”Seon, king of the
          Amorites, who dwelt at Esebon ;      whose dominion extended
          from Arnon which is in the vale, along part of the vale, and the
        3 half of Galaad to Jabok, the boundary of the Ammonites,
          comprehending Araba, to the east side of the sea of Cheneroth,
          and to the sea of Araba, the east side of the salt sea, the way
                                                                                                        ;;;

            in front of Aseirnoth, that leading from Thaiman, at the foot
         4 of Asedoth Phasga : and Og, king of Basan, who was a rem-
         5 nant of the giants, and who dwelt at Astaroth, and Edrain, and
            whose dominion extended from mount Aermon, and from Sek-
            chai, over all the land of Basan, to the borders of G-ergesi,
            and over Machi, and the half of Galaad, to the borders of
         6 Seon king of Esebon.                These, Moses the servant of the Lord,
            and the children of Israel, smote ; and Moses gave this land
            for a possession to Keuben, and (lad, and to the half of the
            tribe of Manasses.
         7       And these are the kings of the Amorites, whom Joshua
            and the children of Israel slew, on the west side of the Jordan,
             from Balagad in the valley of Libanus, to mount Chelcha, as
             you go up to Seir ; and which Joshua gave for a possession to
            the tribes of Israel, according to their respective lots, compre-
             hending the Chettites, and the Amorites, and the Chananites,
             and the Pherezites, and the Evites, and the Jebusites, on the
             mountains, and in the plains, and in Araba, and in Asedoth,
         9 and in the wilderness, and in Xageb : the king of Jericho, and
             the king of Gai, which is near Bethel ; the king of Jerusalem
             the king of Chebron ; the king of Jerimuth ; the king of La-
             chis ; the king of Ailam ; the king of Gazer ; the king of Da-
             bir : the king of Gadir ; the king of Errnatk ; the king of Ader ;
        15 the king of Lebna ; the king of Odollam ; the king of Elath
             the king of Taphut, the king of Opher ; the king of Ophek of
             Arok ; the king of Asom ; the king of Symoon ; the king of
             Mambroth ; the king of Aziph ; the king of Kades ; the king of
             Zachak ; the king of Maredoth ; the king of Jekom of Carmel
             the king of Odollam of Phennealdor ; the king of Gei of Gali-
             lee ; the king of Thersa ; all these kings were twenty nine.
        XIII.          Joshua was now far advanced in years, therefore the
          2 Lord said to Joshua, Thou art advanced in years, and there is
             much land left to be taken possession of.                      Now this is the land
             which is leftâ€”the borders of the Philistines, the Geserites, and
          3 the Chananites.             The land from the desart which is before
             Egypt, to the borders of Akkaron, on the left of the Chanan-
             ites, is set out to the five Satrapies of the Philistines, the Gaz-
             ites and the Azotians, and the Askalonites, and the Getthites,
          4 and the Akkaronites, comprehending the Evaites.                              From Thai-
      Ch. XIII.                     JOSHUA.
          man, throughout the whole land, lieth Chanaan before Gaza.
          And the Sidonians extend to Aphek, and to the borders of
       5 the Amorites.    Now all the land of Galiath-phylistiim, and all
          Libanus, from the rising of the sunâ€”from Galgal, at the foot
       6 of mount Aermon, to the bay of Aimathâ€”all the inhabitants
          of the hilly country, from Libanus to Masereth-memphomaim
          â€”all the Sidoniansâ€”them I will myself drive out from before
          Israel ; but distribute thou it, by lot, to Israel, as I have com-
       7 manded thee.     Now therefore divide this land, for a possession
         among the nine tribes, and the half of the tribe of Manasses.
         Thou shalt give it from the Jordan to the great sea, at the set-
       8 ting of the sun : that great sea shall be your boundary.    To the
         two tribes of Keuben and Gad, and to the half of the tribe of
         Manasses, Moses hath given on the eastern border of the Jor-
         dan.
       9     Moses the servant of the Lord had given them from Aroer,
          which is on the bank of the brook Anion, that city which is in
          the middle of the vale, and all Misor from Maidabanâ€”all the
          cities of Seon, king of the Amorites, who reigned at Esebon,
         to the borders, of the children of Ammon ; and Galaaditis; and
         the country of the Geserites, and the Machatites ; all mount
         Aermon ; and all Basanitis to Acha ; all the kingdom of Og,
         in Basanitis, who reigned in Astaroth and Edrain, he was a
         remnant of the giants, and Moses smote him and destroyed
      13 him.   Now the children of Israel had not destroyed the Gesir-
         ites, nor the Machatite, who was a Chananite.       And the king
         of Gesiri, and the Machatite, still dwelt among the Israelites.
      14 But to the tribe of Levi there was no possession given.        The
         Lord, the God of Israel is himself their possession, as the
         Lord said to them.
             Now this was the distribution which Moses made to the
         children of Israel at Araboth-Moab, on the border of the Jor-
      15 dan, over against Jericho.â€”To the tribe of Eeuben, according
         to their communities, Moses gave, and these were their bor-
      16 ders ; from Aroer, which is in front of the vale of Arnon, includ-
         ing the city in the vale of Arnon, all the Misor to Esebon, and,
      17 all the cities in Misor, namely Daibon, and Baimon-baal, and
      18 house of Meelboth, and Basan, and Bakedmoth, and Mai-
      19 phaad, and Kariathaim, and Sebama, and Serada, and Sion on
     Ch. XIV.                JOSHUA.
     20 mount Enab, and Baithphogor, and Asedothphasga, and Bai-
     21 thaseinoth, even all the cities of Misor, and all the kingdom of
        Seon king of the Amorites, whom Moses slew, and with him
        the leaders of Madiam, Evi, and Eobok, and Sour, and Our,
     22 and Kobe, the chief; at the rifling of Sion, when the Israelites
        slew the inhabitants of Sion, and in the route, Balaam son of
     23 Beor the prophet.These were the borders of Keuben, and Jor-
        dan was a boundary. This was the possession of the children
        of Keuben, according to their communities, and these were
     24 their cities and their sheepcots.And to the children of Gad,
        according to their communities, Moses gave, and these were
     25 their borders, Jazer, all the cities of Galaad, and the half of
        the land of Ammon, even to Araba, which is in front of Arad,
     26 and from Esebon to Araboth, over against Massepha, and Bo-
     27 tanim, and Maan to the border of Daibon, and Enadom, and
        Othargai, and Bainthanabra, and Sokchotha, and Saphan, and
        the residue of the kingdom of Seon, king of Esebon.And
        the Jordan is their boundary, to a part of the sea of Cheneroth,
     28 on the east side of the Jordan.This is the possession of the
        children of Gad, according to their communities, and accord-
        ing to their cities.According to their communities they can
        face their enemies ; for their cities, and their sheepcots, were
        distributed according to their communities.
     29    And to the half of the tribe of Manasses, according to their
     30 communities, Moses gave, and these were their borders ; from
        Maan, all the kingdom of Basan, even all the kingdom of Og,
        king of Basan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Basani-
     31 tis, sixty cities, and the half of Galaad, and in Astaroth, and in
        Edrain, the cities of the kingdom of Og, in Basanitis.These
        he gave to the Machirites, the children of Manasses, to one
        half of the Machirites, the children of Manasses, according to
     32 their communities.These were they to whom Moses gave
        possessions on the east side of the Jordan, at Araboth-Moab,
        on the bank of the Jordan over against Jericho.
    XIV.     Now these are they of the children of Israel who got pos-
        sessions in the land of Chanaan, to whom Eleazar the priest,
        and Joshua son of Nave, and the chiefs of the partriarchal fa-
      2 milies of the tribes of Israel, gave possessions.They gave pos-
        sessions by lot, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Jo-
                                                                                                                             ;

                 shua, to nine tribes and the half of a tribe on this side the Jor-
             4 dan ; but to the Levites he gave no lot among them.                                               Because
                 the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasses and Ephraim ;
                 there was therefore no portion of land given to the Levites,
                 but only cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their
             5 cattle ; for they had cattle.                      As the Lord commanded Moses, so
                 the children of Israel did, when they divided the land.
             6         Now the children of Juda had come to Joshua at Galgal,
                 and Chaleb the son of Jephonne, the Kenezite said to him,
             7 Thou knowest the word which the Lord said to Moses, the
                 man of God, respecting me and thee at Kacles-barne ; for I was
                 forty years old, when Moses the servant of God sent me from
                 Kades-barne to spy the land, and I made him a report to his
             8 mind.          My brethren who went up with me disturbed the heart
                 of the people ; but I determined to follow the Lord my God
             9 so Moses solemnly promised that day, saying, The land to
                 which thou hast gone up shall be thy lot, and thy children's
                 forever, for a possession, because thou hast determined to fol-
           10 low the Lord our God.                          Now the Lord hath kept me alive as
                 he said.         This is the forty fifth year since the Lord spoke this
                 word to Moses, and Israel commenced their wanderings in
           11 the wilderness.                 And behold I am now eighty five years of age ;
                 yet I am now as strong as when Moses sent me ; as able now
           12 as then to go out and come in to battle ; now therefore I ask of
                 thee that mountain, as the Lord said on that day ; for thou didst
                 hear the word on that day.                      The' Enakims indeed are now there ;
                 the cities are fortified and large ; if then the Lord be with me,
           13 I will exterminate them, as the Lord said to me.                                               Thereupon
                 Joshua blessed him, and gave to Chaleb son of Jephonne, the
           14 Kenezite, Chebron for a possession.                                    For this cause Chebron
                 had become the possession of Chaleb son of Jephonne, the
                 Kenezite, at this day, because he followed the command of
                 the Lord God of Israel.                       Now the name of Chebron, formerly,
                 was city Argob.               It was the metropolis of the Enakims.
           XV.             Now when the land had rest from war, the borders of the
                 tribe of Juda, according to their communities, were south-
                 ward along the borders of Idumea, from the wilderness of Sin
             2 to Kades-barne ; and thence their southern boundary was to a
             3 part of the salt sea.                From that extreme point which stretcheth to
     Ch. XV.                        JOSHUA.
         the south, the boundary beginneth its course over against the
         steep of Akrabin, and runneth round Sena, then goeth up
         south of Kades-barne, and runneth by Asoron, and goeth up
      4 to Sarada ; and quitting this directly west of Kades, it proceed-
         ed on to Selmona, and thence to the torrent of Egypt, and the
        termination of this their boundary was to be at the sea.         This
      5 is their southern boundary.     And their boundary on the east is
        the whole extent of the salt sea to the Jordan.     And their boun-
         dary on the north, beginning at the head of the sea, and a part
      6 of the Jordan, runneth up to Baithaglaam, and passeth along
        on the north side of Baitharaba ; thence the boundary goeth
      7 up to the stone of Baion, son of Keuben ; thence the boundary
        advanceth on to the fourth part of the valley of Achor, then
        goeth down to Galgal, which is over against the steep of Adam-
        min, which is on the south side of the valley ; thenceit striketh off
        to the water of the fountain of the sun, and its termination there
      8 is to be the fountain Kogel ; thence the boundary goeth up to the
        valley of Ennom, on the south side of Jebus, which is Jeru-
        salem ; then the boundary turneth off to the top of the moun-
        tain which is to the west, in front of the valley of Ennom, which
      9 is the northern part of the land of Kaphain ; and from the top
        of the mountain the boundary turneth off to the fountain of
    10 water, Naphtho ; and thence to the mountain Ephron ; thence
        the boundary is to stretch on to Baal, which is the city of Jarim,
        then the boundary is to come round west of Baal, and pass on to
        mount Assar, on the back and north side of the city Jarim, which
        is Chaslon, and go down to the city of the sun, passing it on the
    11 south side ; then the boundary goeth out back of Akkaron
        northward ; thence the boundary is to pass on to Sokchoth,
    12 and thence turning southward, to pass on to Lebna.           And the
        termination of this boundary is to be at the sea.      And with re-
        gard to the western boundary, the great sea is to be that bound-
        ary.  These were the boundaries of the children of Juda, ac-
        cording to their communities round about.
    13      Now to Chaleb son of Jephonne he had given a portion in
        the midst of the children of Juda.       By the command of God,
        Joshua had given him the city Arbok, the metropolis of Enak,
    14 the same is Chebron ; and Chaleb son of Jephonne had driven
        out thence the three sons of Enak, Sousi, and Tholami, and
            vol. I.                    3 c
                                                                                                                             ;
                                                           JOSHUA.
           Oh. XV.
          15 Acliima.             And when Chaleb went up thence, against the inha-
                bitants of Dabir, (now the name of Dabir formerly was The
          16 City of Letters) Chaleb said, Whoever will take the city of
                letters and subdue it, I will give him my daughter Aschan for
          17 a wife.            Whereupon Gothoniel son of Chenez, Chaleb's bro-
          18 ther took it.                So he gave him his daughter Aschan for a wife.
                And as she was going out to him she consulted with him, say-
                ing, Let me ask a field of my father.                               And when she had cried
                aloud from the ass, and Chaleb said to her, What is the mat-
          19 ter with thee? she said to him, Give me a blessing.                                                   Seeing
                thou hast sent me to the land of Nageb, give me Botthanis.
                So he gave her the upper and lower Gonaithla.
          20          This was the lot of inheritance of the children of Juda ;
          21 and the cities belonging to the tribe of the children of Juda
                on the borders of Edom, adjoining the wilderness, were Baise-
          22 leel, and Ara, and Asor, and Ikam and Kegma, and Aruel, and
           25 Kades, and Asorionain, and Mainam, and Balmainan, with
                their villages ;            and the cities of the Aserons, which is Aser,
                and Sen, and Salmaa, and Molada, and Seri, and Baiphalath,
                and Cholaseola, and Bersabee, with their villages and sheep-
                cots : Bala, and Bakok, and Asom, and Elboydad, and Baith-
                el,   and Erma, and Sekelak, and Macharim, and Sethannak,
                and Labos, and Sale, and Eromoth, twenty nine cities with
          33 their villages.               In the plain, Astaol, and Baa, and Assa, and Ba-
                men, and Tano, and Iluthoth, and Maiani, and Jermuth, and
                Odollam, and Membra, and Saocho, and Jaseka, and Sakarim,
                and Gadera, with its villagesâ€”fourteen cities, with their villa-
          37 ges : Senna, and Adosan, and Magadalgad, and Dalad, and Mas-
                pha, and Jachareel, and Basedoth, and Ideadalea, and Chabra, and
                Maches, and Maachos, and Geddor, and Bagadiel, and Noman,
          42 and Machedan ; sixteen cities with their villages.                                            Lebna, and
                Ithak, and Anoch, and Jana, and Nasib, and Keilam, and
                Akiezi, and Kezib, and Bathesar, and Ailom, ten cities with
          45 their villages : Akkaron, and the villages thereof, with their
                sheepcots; bordering on Akkaron, Gemna, and all that lay
                near Asedoth, with their villages ; Asiedoth, and the sheep-
                 cots thereof, Gaza, and the villages thereof, and its sheepcots,
                 to the brook of Egypt; and the great sea is the boundary.
           48 And in the hilly country, Samir, and Jether, and Socha, and
                 Kenna, and city of letters, this is Dabir, and Anon, and Es,
     Ch. XVI.                   JOSHUA.
        and Man, and Aisam, and Gosom, and Chalu, and Channa,
        and Gelom ; eleven cities with their villages ; Airein, and
     52 Kemna, and Soma, and Jeroain, and Baithachu, and Phakua,
        and Eyma, and city Arbok, this is Chebron, and Soraith,
     55 nine cities with their sheepcots : Maor, and Chermel, and
        Ozib, and Itan, and Jariel, and Arikani, and Zakanaim, and Ga-
     58 baa, and Thamnatha, nine cities with their villages; Ailua,
        and Bethsur, and Geddon, and Magaroth, and Baithanam, and
     60 Theknm, six cities with their villages : Theko, and Ephratha,
        this is Baithlehem, and Phagor, and Aitan, and Kulon, and
        Tatam, and Thobes, and Karem, and Galem, and Thether,
        and Manocho, eleven cities with their villages : Kariath-baal,
        this is the city Jarim, and Sotheba, two cities with their sheep-
     61 cots : and Baddargis, and Tharabaam, and Ainon, and Aio-
        chioza, and Naphlazon, and the cities Sadon and Agkades,
     63 seven cities with their villages.But the Jebusites dwelt in Je-
        rusalem, and the children of Jnda were not able to destroy
        them.  So the Jebusites had dwelt in Jerusalem to this day.
     XVI.     And the borders of the children of Joseph were from
        the Jordan, in front of Jericho eastward, and to go up from Je-
      2 richo to the hilly countryâ€”the wilderness to Baithel-louza, and
        having come out to Baithel, the boundary is to run along the
      3 borders of Achatarothi, and proceed westward, along the bor-
        ders of Aptalim, till it reacheth the borders of lower Baithoron ;
      4 and the termination thereof is to be at the sea.And when the
      5 children of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasses, got their posses-
        sions, the borders of the children of Ephraim, according to
        their communities were these.  The boundary of their posses-
        sion from the east were Ataroth, and Erok, till it reached the
      6 upper Baithoron, and Gazara; then the boundary was to pro-
        ceed westward to Ikasmon, on the north side of Therma, then
        to come round eastward to Thenasa, and Selles, and from the
         east border of that to pass on to Janoka, and to Macho, and
         Ataroth, including their villages; then to come to Jericho,
      8 and terminate at the Jordan : And from Taphu the boundary
         was to run westward by Chelkana and to terminate at the sea.
         This possession of the tribe of Ephraim, according to their
       9 communities, with the cities set apart for the children of
         Ephraim, in the inheritance of the children of Manasses, com-
       Ch. XVII.                      JOSHUA.
       10 prehended all their cities and their villages.     But Ephraim did
          not destroy the Chananites who dwelt in Gazer.           So the Cha-
          nanites   have dwelt among the Ephraimites to this day.
       XVII.      And the borders of the tribe of the children of Manas-
          ses were theseâ€”Because he was the first born of Joseph, Ma-
          chir the first born of Manasses, the father of Galaad, being a
          man of war, had a possession in Galaaditis, and in Basanitis ;
        2 and the rest of the sons of Manasses had possessions according
          to their communities, namely, the sons of Jezi, and the sons of
          Kelez, and the sons of Jeziel, and the sons of Sychem, and
          the sons of Symarim, and the sons of Opher.          These were the
        3 males according to their communities.         Now Salpaad, son of
          Opher, had no sons, but only daughters; and these were the
          names of the daughters of Salpaad, Maala, and Noua, and
        4 Egla, and Melcha, and Thersa ; and they stood before Elea-
          zar the priest, and before Joshua, and before the chiefs and
          said, God hath, by the ministry of Moses, commanded to give
        5 us an inheritance among our brethren.        Accordingly there was
          a possession given them, by the command of the Lord, among
          their father's brothers, and their lot happened to be on the
          borders of Anassa, the plain of Labek, a part of the land of
        6 Galaad, on the bank of the Jordan, because the daughters of
          the children of Manasses had a possession in the midst of their
          brethren; and Galaad belonged to the rest of the children of
          Manasses.
        7     Now these were the borders of the children of Manasses;
          Delanath, which is in front of the children of Anath, and ex-
          tendeth to the borders, to Jamin, and Jassib, to the fountain
        8 Thaphthoth, is to belong to Manasses ; but Thapheth, which
          is within the bounds of the Manassites, is to belong to the chil-
        9 dren of Ephraim.      Thence the boundary is to go down to the
          vale of Karana, on the south side, over against the vale Ja-
          riel ; but Tereminthus, which is within the bounds of a city of
      10 Manasses, is to belong to Ephraim; then the border of Ma-
          nasses runneth northward, to the brook, and his boundary is to
          be the sea.   The south side belonged to Ephraim, and the north
      11 side to Manasses, and the sea was to be their boundary.           And
          on the north they were to join upon Aser, and on the east
          upon Issachar.    And Manasses was to have in Issachar, and in
                                                                                                                ;
       Ch. XVIII.                                   JOSHUA.
             Aser, Baithsan, with their villages, and the inhabitants of Dor,
             and its villages, and the inhabitants of Mageddo, and its villa-
       12 ges ; and the third part of Mapheta, and its villages ; but the
             Manassites were not able to exterminate the inhabitants of
       13 these cities.            The Chananites had begun to settle in that land,
             and when the Israelites became strong, they brought the Cha-
             nanites into subjection, and did not utterly extirpate them.
        14        When the children of Joseph complained to Joshua, saying,
             Why hast thou given us but one lot, and one portion, to in-
             herit, seeing I am a numerous people, and God hath blessed
        15 me? Joshua said to them, If thou art a numerous people, go
             up into the forest and clear it for thyself, if the mountain
        16 Ephraim be too narrow for thee.                              Whereupon they said we
             are not satisfied with mount Ephraim, and the Chananites, who
             dwell there in Baithsan, and its villages, and in the valley of
        17 Jezrael, have choice horses, and iron.                           But Joshua said to the
             children of Joseph, If thou art a numerous people, and hast
             great power, thou wilt not have one lot only, for the forest will
        18 be thine.          Though it is a forest thou canst clear it, and it shall
             be thine when thou hast rooted out the Chananites.                                For though
             they have choice horses, thou shalt excel them in strength.
        XVIII.             When all the congregation of Israel assembled at Se-
         2 lo, and fixed there the tabernacle of the testimony, and the land
             was subdued under them, but there still remained among the
             children of Israel seven tribes who had not received their por-
         3 tions, Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long will you
             be devoid of courage, to take possession of the laud which
         4 the Lord our God hath given ?                         Appoint from among you three
             men of a tribe, and let them arise, and go through the land,
             and lay before me a draught of it, as it ought to be divided.
         5 And when they came to him he distinguished for them seven
             portions, saying, Let Juda stand.                        Their boundary is south of
             this.     And let the children of Joseph stand.                         Their boundary is
             north of this.          Divide ye therefore the land into seven parcels,
             and bring them to me, and I will cast the lot for you before the
          7 Lord our God; for the children of Levi are to have no lot
             among you ; for the priesthood of the Lord is their portion
             and Gad and Keuben, and the half of the tribe of Manasses,
             have received their possession on the eastern bank of the Jor-
      Ch. XVIII.                    JOSHUA.
       8 clanâ€”that which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them.         So
         the men prepared to set out, and when they were going to tra-
         verse the land, Joshua gave them a charge, saying, Go and tra-
         verse the land, and come to me, and I will here cast the lots
       9 for you before the Lord, at Selo.     So they went, and traversed
         the land, and when they had viewed it, and written it by cities
          in seven parcels in books, they brought them to Joshua, and
      10 Joshua cast lots for them at Selo, before the Lord, and the lot
      11 of the tribe of Benjamin came out first, according to their com-
          munities, and the bouuds of their lot came out between the
      12 children of Juda, and the children of Joseph ; and these were
          their borders.  On the north their boundary was to go up from
          the Jordan, back of Jericho, on the north side, and to run west-
      13 ward to the mountain, and come out at Mabdaritis-Baithon ;
          thence the boundary was to run to the border of Louza, back
          of Louza on the south side of it, this is Baithel ; thence the
          boundary was to run down to Maatarob-Orech, by the high
      14 land which is south of the lower Baithoron ; thence the bound-
          ary was to wind, and proceed to that part on the south which
          overlooketh the sea, from the mountain before Baithoron south-
          ward, and to terminate at Kariathbaal, that is Kariathiarim, a
          city of the children of Juda.    This was the western part.    And
      15 with regard to the southern part ; from a part of Kariathbaal,
          the boundary was to run to Gasin, by the fountain of water
      16 Naphtho ; thence the boundary was to run down part of the
          way, that is, in front of the forest Sonnam, which is the north-
          ern part of Emek-raphain ; thence down to Gehenna, back of
      17 Jebusi, south of it, down to the fountain Kogel ; then to turn
          off to the fountain Baithsamys, and pass on to Galiloth, which
          is over against the steep of Aithamin ; then down to the stone
       18 of Baion, one of the sous of Keuben ; then to run back of
          Baithabara, north of it, down to the border at the north end of
       19 the sea ; and the termination of this boundary was to be at the
          north bay of the salt sea, and at the south end of the Jordan.
       20 This was the southern boundary.      And the Jordan was to be the
          eastern boundary.    This was the inheritance of the children of
          Benjamin, and these their borders round about, according to
       21 their communities.    And the cities of the Benjaminites accord-
           ing to their communities were Jericho, and Bethegaio, and

              cities with their villages.                   This was the inheritance of the chil-
              dren of Benjamin, according to their communities.
        XIX.             Next came out the lot of the children of Symeon, and
              their inheritance was in the midst of the lots of the children of
          2 Juda.          And this was their lotâ€”Bersabe, and Semao, and Ke-
              ladam, and Arsola, and Bola, and Jason, and Erthula, and Bula,
              and Erma, and Sikelak, and Baithmachereb, and Sarsusin, and
              Batheroth, with their fields, thirteen cities with their villages
                                                                                                                          ;

              with their villages, around these their cities, as far as Balek on
          8 the way to Bameth southward.                              This was the inheritance of the
          9 tribe of the Symeonites according to their communities.                                               From
              the portion of Juda was taken the inheritance of the tribe of the
              Symeonites; because the portion of the children of Juda was
              too large for them, therefore the children of Symeon got an in-
              heritance in the midst of their portion.
         10         And the third lot came out for Zabulon, according to their
              communities ; and these were to be the bounds of their inhe-
         11 ritanceâ€”Esedekgola, the sea and Magalda, were to be their
              boundaries, and their boundary was to join upon Baitharaba, at
         12 the valley which is in front of Jekman : then it turned up from
               Sedduck, from the east of Baithsamys, along the borders of
               Chaselothaith, and was to turn off to Dabiroth, and go up to
               Phaggai; thence to come round on the other side, eastward,
               to Gebere, by the city Katesem, and pass on by Kemmonaa
         14 Matharaoza ; then the boundary was to go round, northward,
               by Amoth, and the termination of it was to be at Gaphael.                                              In-
               cluding Katanath, and Xabaal, and Symoon, and Jericho, and
         16 Baithman, this was the inheritance of the children of Zabulon,
               according to their communities, their cities and their villages.
         17          And the fourth lot came out for Issachar, and their borders
               were Jazel, and Chassaloth, and Sunam, and Agin, and Siona,
               and Beeroth, and Anachereth, and Dabiron, and Kison, and

         Kebes, and Kernrnas, and Jeon, and Tonirnan, and Aimerek,
         and Bersaphes, and their borders were to join on Gaithbor, and
         on Salim westward, and on Baithsamys, and the termination of
     23 their boundary was to be the Jordan.     This was the inheri-
         tance of the tribe of the children of Issachar, aaccording to their
         communities, their cities and their villages.
     24     And the fifth lot came out for Aser, according to their com-
         munities; And their borders were Exaleketh, and Aleph, and
         Baithok, and Xeaph, and Elimelech, and Amiel, and Maasa,
         and to join on Karmelo, westward, and on Sion and Labanath,
         and to turn from the rising of the sun, and Baithegeneth, and
         to join Zabulon, and Ekgai, and Phthaiel, on the north ; then
         the boundary is to come to Saphthaibaithme, and Inael, and
         turn off to Chobamasomel, and Elbon, and Kaab, and Eme-
     29 maon, and Kanthan, till it reached great Sidon ; Then the
         boundary is to turn up to Kama, and to the fountain Masphas-
     30 set, and the Tyrians ; Then the boundary is to turn up to Ja-
         siph ; and the termination of it is to be the sea, including Apo-
         leb, and Echozob, and Archob, and Aphek, and Kaau ; this was
         the inheritance of the children of Aser, according to their com-
         munities, including their cities and their villages.
     32     And the sixth lot came out for JSTephthaleim, and their bor-
         ders were Moolam, and Mola, and Besemin, and Arme, and
         Naboch, and Jephthamai, even to Dodam, and the terminations
         were the Jordan ; then their boundary was to turn westward,
         by Aththabor, and then turn off to Jakana, and join Zabulon
         on the south, and Aser on the west, and Jordan on the east.
      35 Now the fenced cities of the Tyrians, were Tyre and Oma-
         thadaketh, and Kenereth, and Armaith, and Arael, and Asor,
         and Kades, and Assari, and Bathaser, and Keroe, and Mega-
         laarim, and Baiththame, and Thessamus.    This was the inhe-
         ritance of the children of Xephthaleim.
      40    And the seventh lot came out for Dan; and their borders
         were Sarath, and Asa, and the cities Sammaus, and Salamin,
         and Ammon, and Silatha, and Elon, and Thamnatha, and Ak-
         karon, and Alkatha, and Begethon, and Gebeelan, and Azor,
         and Banaibakat, and Gethrimmon, and on the west of Jerakon,
      48 the border near Joppa. This was the inheritance of the tribe of
         the Danites, according to their communities, including their

       cities and their villages.    (But the children of Dan did not root
       out the Amorites who distressed them on the mountains, and
       the Amorites did not suffer them to come down into the valley.
   47 Nay they took from them the border of their portion.               Where-
       upon the children of Dan went and made war on Lachis, and
       took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and dwelt
       there, and called its name Lasen Dan.             The Amorites conti-
       nued also to dwell in Elom, and Salamin, but the hand of
       Ephraim was heavy upon them, and they were made tributa-
       ries to them.)
   49      Now when the children of Israel set out to enter into the
       land, according to their respective bounds, the Israelites gave
       Joshua son of Nave, a portion among them.              By the command
        of God, they gave him the city which he asked, namely Tham-
       nasarach, which is on mount Ephraim, and he rebuilt the city,
       and dwelt there.
    .~J1    These were the portions which Eleazar the priest, and Jo-
        shua son of Nave, and the chiefs of the patriarchal families,
        distributed by lot among the tribes of Israel, at Selo, in the
        presence of the Lord, at the doors of the tabernacle of the testi-
        mony.    So they set out to take possession of the land.
    XX.       Now the Lord had spoken to Joshua, saying, Speak to
     2 the children of Israel and say, Give the cities of refuge which
        I ordered you by Moses, a refuge for the manslayer who hath
     3 killed a person unawares.        And these cities shall be for you a
        refuge, that the slayer may not be put to death by the avenger
     7 of blood, until he stand before the congregation for trial ; and
        he had set apart Kades, in Galilee, on mount Nephthaleim, and
        Sychem, on mount Ephraim, and the city Arbok, which is Che-
     8 bron, on the mountain of Juda : And on the bank of the Jor-
        dan they had given Bosor, in the wilderness, in the plain, from
        the tribe of Eeuben, and Aremoth in Galaad, from the tribe of
        Gad, and Gaulon in Basanitis from the tribe of Manasses.
     9 These are the cities renowned among the children of Israel and
        the proselytes who dwell among them, for every one who smit-
        eth a person unawares to flee thither, that he may not die by
        the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stand before the con-
        gregation for trial.

       Ch.
           dren of Levi came to Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of
           Nave, and to the chiefs of the patriarchal families, of the tribes
         2 of Israel, and spoke to them at Selo, in the land of Chanaan,
           saying, The Lord, by the ministry of Moses, commanded to
           give us cities to dwell in, with the arable lands around for our
        3 cattle ; whereupon the children of Israel gave the Levites for a
           possession, by the command of the Lord, the following cities
        4 with their suburbs.    And the lot came out for the community
           of Kaath, and there fell by lot to the children of Aaron, the
           priests, who were Levites, out of the tribe of Juda, and from
           the tribe of Symeon, and from the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen
        5 cities; and to the rest of the Kaathites out of the tribe of
           Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and from half of the tribe
        6 of Manasses by lot ten cities ; and to the Gersonites, from the
           tribe of Issachar, and from the tribe of Aser, and from the
           tribe of Nephthaleim, and from the half of the tribe of Manas-
        7 ses in Basan, thirteen cities ; And to the Merarites, according
           to their communities, from the tribe of Keuben, and from the
           tribe of Gad, and from the tribe of Zabulon, by lot, twelve ci-
        8 ties.  These cities, with their suburbs, the children of Israel
        9 gave by lot to the Levites, as the Lord commanded Moses.        So
           the tribe of the children of Juda, and the tribe of the children
           of Symeon, gave, and there were given from the tribe of the
           children of Benjamin, the following cities which were assigned
       10 to the children of Aaron, of the community of Kaath, who were
       11 Levitesâ€”because the lot fell to them, they gave them Kari-
           atharbok, the capital of the Enakims, which is Chebron, on the
       12 mountain of Juda.     Now the suburbs around it, and the fields
           belonging to the city, and the villages thereof, Joshua had giv-
           en to the children of Chaleb, son of Jephonne, for a possession ;
       13 but to the sons of Aaron, they gave Chebron, the city of refuge
       14 for the manslayer, with what was set apart for it as such, and
           Lemma with its suburbs, and Ailom with its suburbs, and
           Tema with its suburbs, and Gella with its suburbs, and Dabir
           with its suburbs, and Asa with its suburbs, and Tanu with its
        17 suburbs, and Baithsamys with its suburbs, nine cities from
           these two tribes ; and from the tribe of Benjamin, Gabaon with
           its suburbs, and Gatheth with its suburbs, and Anathoth with
           its suburbs, and Gamala with its suburbs, four cities.   All the
           cities of the children of Aaron the priests were thirteen.
                                                                                                        ;

        20        And to the communities of the Kaathites, the Levites, the rest
             of the Kaathites, was assigned, from the tribe of Ephraim, the
             city of their priests; and they gave them Sychem, the city
             of refuge for the manslayer with its appurtenances, and Gazara
             with its fields and its suburbs, and Baithoron with its suburbs,
             four cities ; and from the tribe of Dan, Elkothaim with its sub-
             urbs, and Gethedan with its suburbs, and Ailon with its sub-
        25 urbs, and Getheremmon with its suburbs, four cities ; and from
             the half of the tribe of Manasses, Tanach with its suburbs, and
        20 Jebatha with its suburbs, two cities.                     All the cities for the re-
             maining communities of the Kaathites were ten, with their
             suburbs.
       27        And to the children of Gerson, the Levites, they gave out
            of the half of the tribe of Manasses, the city set apart for the
            manslayers, Gaulon in Basanitis with its suburbs, and Bosora
        28 with its suburbs, two cities ; and out of the tribe of Issachar,
             Kison with its suburbs, and Lebba with its suburbs, and Rem-
            math with its suburbs, and Fountain of letters with its suburbs,
       30 four cities ; and out of the tribe of Aser, Basellan with its su-
            burbs, and Dabbon with its suburbs, and Chelkat with its su-
        32 burbs, and Raab with its suburbs, four cities ; and out of the
             tribe of Nephthaleim, Kades in Galilee, the city set apart for
             the slayer, with its suburbs, and Nemmath with its suburbs,
             and Themmon with its suburbs, three cities.                         All the cities of
            the Gersonites, according to their communities, were thirteen
            cities.
       34         And to the community of the Merarites, the rest of the
            Levites, they gave out of the tribe of Zabulon, Maan with its
            suburbs, and Kades with its suburbs, and Sella with its su-
       36 burbs, three cities ; and on the bank of the Jordan, over against
            Jericho, out of the tribe of Reuben, the city of refuge for the
            slayer, namely, Bosor, in the wilderness, which is called Miso
             with its suburbs, and Jazer with its suburbs, and Dekmon
            with its suburbs, and Mapha with its suburbs, four cities
       38 and from the tribe of Gad, the city of refuge for the slayer,
            namely, Bamoth in Galaad with its suburbs, and Kamin with
            its suburbs, and Esbon with its suburbs, and Jazer with its
            suburbs ; all the cities four.              All the cities for the children of
       Ch. XXII.                    JOSHUA.
          Merari, according to their communities, being the remaining
          families of the tribe of Levi, were twelve cities with their
       41 borders.  All the cities of the Levites, in the midst of the pos-
          session of the children of Israel, were forty eight with the
       42 grounds appropriate to them, around these cities.       All these
          cities had every one a circuit of ground around it.
              Now when Joshua had finished dividing the land among
          them by their borders, the children of Israel gave Joshua a
          portion, by the command of the Lord.             They gave him
          the city which he asked.      They gave him Thamnasachar on
          mount Ephraim, and Joshua rebuilt the city, and dwelt there-
          in.  And Joshua took the stone knives with which he had cir-
          cumcised the children of Israel, who were born by the way in
          the wilderness, and deposited them at Thamnasachar.
       43     Thus the Lord gave Israel all the land which he solemnly
          promised to give to their fathers, and they took possession of
       44 it, and dwelt therein ; and the Lord gave them rest round
          about, as he sware to their fathers.  Of all their enemies not one
          rose up against them.     The Lord delivered all their enemies
       45 into their hands.    There was not a failure of any of the good
          things Avhich the Lord spoke to the children of Israel.      They
          were all accomplished.
       XXII.      Then Joshua convened the children of Eeuben, and
          the children of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasses, and
        2 said to them, You have hearkened to all that Moses the ser-
          vant of the Lord commanded you ; and you have obeyed my
        3 orders according to all that he commanded you.       You have not
          for these many years left your brethren : even to this day you
        4 have kept the command of the Lord your God. Xowthe Lord our
          God hath given our brethren rest as he promised them.         Xow
          therefore return and go to your homes, and to the land of your
          possession, which Moses gave you on the bank of the Jordan.
        5 But be very careful to perform the commandments and the
          law which Moses the servant of the Lord charged you to do,
          to love the Lord our God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his
          commandments, and to cleave to him and serve him with your
        6 whole heart, and with your whole soul.       Then Joshua blessed
           them and dismissed them, and they set out on their return to
           their homes.
     Ch. XXTI.                 JOSHUA.
      7     Now to one half of* the tribe of Manasses Moses had given
        a possession in Basanitis, and to the other half Joshua gave
         one on the western side of the Jordan, among their brethren.
       8 So when Joshua had sent them away to their homes, and
        blessed them, they set out homewards with much wealth, for
        they had shared with their brethren, vast numbers of cattle,
        and a great abundance of silver, and gold, and iron, and rai-
      9 ment, the spoil of their enemies. And when the children of
         Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half of the tribe of
         Manasses, had set out from the children of Israel, at Selo in
         the land of Chanaan, to go to Galaad, to the land of their pos-
         session, which they had got from Moses by the command of
     10 the Lord, and were come to Galaad of the Jordan, which is in
         the land of Chanaan, the Keubenites and the Gadites, and the
         half of the tribe of Manasses built there an altar by the Jor-
      11 danâ€”an altar great and conspicuous. And when the Israelites
         heard it said, Behold the Beubenites, and the Gadites, and the
         half of the tribe of Manasses have built an altar on the borders
      12 of the land of Chanaan, at Galaad of the Jordan, on the bank
         of the children of Israel, all the Israelites assembled at Selo,
      13 to go up to war against them.And the children of Israel sent
         to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half of the
         tribe of Manasses, to the land of Galaad, Phineas, son of Elea-
      II zar, son of Aaron, the chief priest, and ten of the chiefs with
         him, a chief from the head family of every tribe of Israel.Now
      15 the chiefs of the head families are the chiliarchs of Israel.And
         when they came to the Beubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
         of the tribe of Manasses, to the land of Galaad, they spoke to
      16 them, saying, Thus saith the whole congregation of the Lord,
         What trespass is this which you have committed in the pre-
         sence of the God of Israel, to turn away this day from the
         Lord, having built for yourselves an altar that you may apos-
      17 tatize from the Lord ?Is the sin of Phogor a small matter to
         you ?  Because we have not been cleansed from it even to this
         day, though there was a plague in the congregation of the
      18 Lord ; are you therefore now turned away from the Lord ?
         For the consequence will be, if you this day apostatize from
         the Lord, there will be to-morrow wrath against all Israel.
      19 Now if the land of your possession be too small for you, come
      Ch. XXII.                   JOSHUA.
          over to the land of the possession of the Lord, where the ta-
          bernacle of the Lord is pitched, and take a possession among
          us, and do not become apostates from God, nor revolt from
          the Lord by building for yourselves an altar apart from the al-
      20 tar of the Lord our God.      Behold when Achar, son of Zara,
         committed a trespass in regard to the Anathema, was there not
          wrath against all the congregation of Israel, so that he perish-
         ed not alone for his sin ?
      21     In reply to this the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
         half of the tribe of Manasses, said to the chiliarchs of Israel,
      22 The Lord God is our God, and God himself our God hath
         seen, and Israel themselves may determine.      If through apos-
         tacy we have trespassed in the sight of the Lord, let him not
      23 this day deliver us.  Or if we have built an altar for ourselves,
         to apostatize from the Lord our God, or to offer thereon a sacri-
         fice of whole burnt offerings, or to offer thereon a sacrifice of
      24 thanksgiving, let the Lord make inquisition.      Indeed from a
         sacred regard to this matter we have done this, saying, That
      25 your children may not hereafter say to our children, What
         have you to do with the Lord God of Israel ?      The Lord hath
         made the Jordan a boundary between us and you ; so that you
         have no portion in the Lord.    And so your children may make
      26 our children strangers, that they may not worship the Lord, we
         therefore determined to act in this mannerâ€”to build this altar,
      27 not for the purpose of homage offerings, nor for sacrifices ; but
          that it may be a witness between us and you, and our poste-
         rity after us, of our right to perform the service of the Lord
         before him, with our homage offerings, and our incense offer-
         ings, and our sacrifices of thanksgiving ; so that your children
          may not say to our children, You have no portion in the Lord.
      28 For we said, If it should ever happen that they should speak
         so to us, or to our posterity hereafter, they may say, Behold
         the similitude of the altar of the Lord which our fathers made,
         not for the purpose of homage offerings, nor for sacrifices,
         but to be a witness between you and us, and our children after
      29 us.  God forbid that we should turn away from the Lord, by
         apostatizing this day from the Lord, so far as to build an altar
          for the purpose of homage offerings, or incense offerings, or
          sacrifices of thanksgiving, over and above the altar of the
          Lord, which is before his tabernacle.

     Ch. XXIII.                  JOSHUA.
     30     When Phineas the priest, and all the chief's of the congre-
         gation of Israel who were with him, heard the words which
         the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half of the tribe of Ma-
     31 nasses, had spoken, they were pleased.   And Phineas the priest
         said to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half of the tribe
         of Manasses, This day we perceive that the Lord is with us, be-
         cause you have not committed a trespass before the Lord, and be-
     32 cause you have delivered the Israelites out of the hand of the Lord.
         So Phineas the priest returned, with the chiefs, from the children
         of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, and from the half
         of the tribe of Manasses, from Galaad to the land of Chanaan,
         to the children of Israel, and brought them this answer, and
     33 it pleased them.    Upon their delivering this message to the
         children of Israel, they blessed the God of the Israelites, and
         no more talked of going up against them to battle, to lay waste
         the land of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half of
     34 the tribe of Manasses.   So they dwelt therein, and Joshua gave
         a name to the altar of Reuben, and Gad, and the half of the
         tribe of Manasses, and said, It is a witness for them that the
         Lord is their God.
     XXIII.       Now after many years, when the Lord had given Is-
       2 rael rest from all their enemies round about, Joshua being far
         advanced in years, convoked all the sons of Israel, their senate,
         and their chiefs, and their judges, and their under officers, and
       3 said to them, I am grown old, and am far advanced in years.
         Now you have seen all that the Lord our God hath done to
         these nations for your sake ; for it is the Lord your God who
       4 hath fought for you.  You see that I have thrown in among the
         lots for your tribes, the nations which are left by you, with all
         the nations which I have exterminated between the Jordan and
       5 the great sea, which is to be your western boundary.  The Lord
         our God will himself root them out from before you until they be
         destroyed.  He will send the wild beasts against them, until they
         utterly destroy them and their kings from before you, so that
         you may possess their land, as the Lord our God hath spoken
       6 to you.  Be strong therefore to keep with all diligence, and to do
         all that are written in the book of the law of Moses, that you
       7 may not turn aside to the right, nor to the left.     That you
         may have no fellowship with those nations which are left,
                                                                                                                          ;
        Ch. XXIV.                                       JOSHUA.
              the names of their gods must not be mentioned among you
              nor shall you perform religious service to them, nor worship
          8 them ; but you shall cleave to the Lord our God, as you have
          9 done to this day.                   Then will the Lord root them out from be-
             fore you, though they are great and powerful nations.                                                None
             indeed have been able to stand before you even to this day.
        10 One of you hath chased a thousand, because the Lord our
        11 God himself fought for you, as he promised you.                                                 Therefore
        12 take good heed to love the Lord our God.                                            For if you turn
             away, and join yourselves with those nations which are left
        13 with you, and intermarry with them, and be mixed with them,
             and they with you ; be assured that the Lord will no more drive
             out those nations from before you ; but they shall be to you
             snares and stumbling blocks, and nails in your heels, and darts
             in your eyes, until you be destroyed from this good land, which
        14 the Lord your God hath given you.                                      As for me, I am going
             speedily the way of all who are on the earth.                                        Now you must
             know in your heart, and in your soul, that not one word hath
       15 failed of all that the Lord our God hath said.                                        With respect to
             all that have come to us, not one of them have failed.                                           Now as
             all the good things, which the Lord hath spoken respecting
             you, have come to you, so the Lord God will bring upon you
             all the evil things, until he destroy you from this good land,
       16 which the Lord hath given you, when you transgress the co-
             venant of the Lord our God, which he hath commanded us,
             and go and serve other gods and worship them.
       XXIV.                  Again Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Se-
             lo, and having convened their elders, and their under officers,
             and their judges, and placed them before God, Joshua said
         2 to all the people, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, your
             fathers dwelt in old time Beyond the river, namely, Thara, the
         3 father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor.                                        And they served
             other gods.             And I took your father Abraham from Beyond
             the river, and led him through all this land, and multiplied his
         4 seed, and gave him Isaak ; and to Isaak, Jacob and Esau ; and
             to Esau I gave mount Seir for a possession ; but Jacob and
             his sons went down into Egypt, and became there a nation,
         5 great, numerous and powerful.                               And when the Egyptians af-
                                                                                                                         ;
       Ch. XXIV.                                        JOSHUA.
             flicted them, I smote Egypt with signal miracles, which I did
              among them.
         6         Now after this he brought our fathers out of Egypt, and
             you marched into the Ked sea ; and when the Egyptians pur-
         7 sued our fathers, with horses and chariots, into the Ked sea,
             and we cried to the Lord, he put a cloud and darkness between
             us and the Egyptians ; and brought the sea upon them, and it
         S overwhelmed them.                     Your eyes have seen all that the Lord did
             in the land of Egypt.                   And when you had been many years in
             the wilderness, he brought us to the land of the Amorites,
             who dwelt on the border of the Jordan ; and the Lord deliver-
             ed them into our hands, and you took possession of their land,
         9 and extirpated them from before you.                                    And when Balak, son
             of Sepphor, king of Moab, arose and drew up in array against
       10 Israel, and sent for Balaam to curse us, the Lord thy God
             would not destroy thee, nay he caused him to bless us with
             blessings, and rescued us out of their hands, and delivered
       11 them up.                And when you crossed the Jordan, and came to
             Jericho, and the Amorites who inhabited Jericho, and the Cha-
             nanites, and the Pherezites, and the Evites, and the Jebu-
             sites, and the Chettites, and the Gergasites, fought against us,
       12 the Lord delivered them into our hands.                                        Indeed he sent be-
             fore you the hornet, and drove them out from before us, even
             the twelve kings of the Amorites, not with thy sword, nor with
             thy bow, and hath given you a land, on which you did not be-
             stow labour, and cities which you did not build, and you are
             settled therein, and are eating of vineyards, and olive yards,
             which you did not plant.                         Now therefore fear the Lord, and
             serve him with sincerity and truth, and put away the strange
             gods which our fathers worshipped in Btijoml the river, and in
       15 Egypt, and serve the Lord.                           But if it seemeth not good to you
             to    serve the Lord, chuse for yourselves this day whom you
             will serve, either the gods of your fathers \vh<> were in Beyond
             the river, or the gods of the Amurites, in whose land you
             dwell.        But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord
             for he is holy.
       16          Upon this the people answered, and said, God forbid that
       17 we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods.                                             The Lord is
             (Air God.         He is God.              He hath brought up us and our fathers
                   vol. i.                                    3 E
      Oh. XXIV.                  JOSHUA.
         out of Egypt, and preserved us all the way we went, and
         arnoug all the nations through which we passed, and the Lord
      18 hath driven out from before us the Arnorites, and all the na-
         tions who dwelt in this land ; therefore we will serve none but
         the Lord ; for he is our God.
      19    And Joshua said to the people, You may not be able to
         serve the Lord, because he is the Holy God, and will be zeal-
         ous.  He will not bear with your sins and your iniquities.
      20 When you forsake the Lord, and serve other gods, he will
         come and afflict you ; and consume you, proportionally to the
         good he hath done you.
      21    And the people said to Joshua, Nay, we will serve none
         but the Lord.
      22    Then Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against
      23 yourselves that you have chosen the Lord to serve him. Now
         therefore put away the strange gods which are among you,
      24 and incline your heart to the Lord God of Israel.   And the
         people said to Joshua, We will serve the Lord, and hearken
         to his voice.
      25    So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and
         gave it to them as a law, and a solemn decision at Selo, before
      26 the tabernacle of the Lord God of Israel.  And when he had
         written these words in the book of the laws of God, he took
         a great stone, and set it up under a fir tree which was over
      27 against the Lord, and Joshua said to the people, Behold this
         stone shall be among you for a witness, that it hath heard all
         that were said by the Lord, for he hath this day spoken to you ;
         and this shall be among you for a witness in the latter days,
         whenever you prove false to the Lord my God.
      28     Then Joshua dismissed the people, and they departed
      31 every one to his place ; and Israel served the Lord all the
         days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who out lived
          Joshua, and who had seen all the works of the Lord which he
      29 had done for Israel.And after those things, Joshua the son of
      30 Xave, the servant of the Lord died at the age of a hundred and
         ten years ; and they buried him in the boundaries of his inhe-
         ritance, at Thamnasachar, on mount Ephrairn, north of mount
          Gaas. There they deposited with him, in the grave in which
         they buried him, the stone knives with which he had circum-
      Ch. XXIV.                       JOSHUA.
         cisecl the children of Israel at Galgala, as the Lord command-
         ed them, when he had brought them out of Egypt.              And there
         they are at this day.
     32      Now the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt,
         the bones of Joseph, and they buried them at Sikimoi, in that
         portion of the field which Jacob purchased of the Amorites
         who dwelt at Sikimoi, for a hundred lambs, and which he gave
         to Joseph for an inheritance.
     33      And after these things, Eleazar son of Aaron, the chief
         priest,  died,   and was buried in Gabaar, which belonged to
         Phineas his son, which he had given him on mount Ephraim.
         At that time the children of Israel took up the ark of God, and
         carried it about among them.        And Phineas officiated as priest
         in the room of his father Eleazar.       And when he died, he was
         buried in Gabaar, which belonged to him.         As for the children
         of Israel, they had gone to their several homes, and to their re-
         spective: cities.  And when the children of Israel fell to wor-
         shipping Astarte, and Astaroth, and the gods of the nations
         around them, the Lord delivered them into the hands of Eglon
         king of Moab, and he exercised dominion over them eighteen
         years.
                                      JUDGES.
      I.    Now, after the decease of Joshua, the children of Israel in-
         quired of the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us as our
         leader against the Chananites, to conduct the war against them ?
       2 xlnd the Lord said, Juda shall go up.        Behold I have delivered
       3 the land into his hand.       Whereupon Juda said to his brother
         Symeon, Come up with me in my lot, and let us array our-
         selves against the Chananites, and I will go up with thee in
       4 thy lot.   So Symeon went up with him.            And Juda went up,
         and the Lord delivered into their hands the Chananites, and
         the Pherezites, and they smote them in Bezek, to the num-
       5 ber of ten thousand men.         When they came up with Adoni-
         bezek,   in Bezek, they drew up in array against him, and
       6 smote the Chananites and the Pherezites.             And Adonibezek
         fled, and they pursued him, and took him, and cut off his
       7 thumbs and his great toes.            Whereupon Adonibezek said,
          Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut
       Ch. I.                          JUDGES.
           off, have been under my table, gathering up the offals thereof;
           therefore as I have done, so hath God requited me : And they
           brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
         8     (Now the children of Juda had fought against Jerusalem,
           and taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and
         9 burned the city with fire ; And, after that, the children of
           Juda had gone down to wage war with the Chananites, who
       10 inhabited the hilly country, and the south, and the plain.        And
           when Juda went against the Chananites who dwelt in Chebron,
           (the name of which city formerly was Kariath-arbok-sepher,)
           Chebron came out against them ; and they smote Sessi, and
           Achiman, and Tholmi, descendants of Enak, and they went
        11 up thence against the inhabitants of Dabir, (now the name of
        12 Dabir formerly was Kariath-sepher [city of letters]) and Cha-
           leb said, whoever will smite the city of letters, and take it, I
       13 will give him my daughter Ascha for a wife ; whereupon Go-
           thoniel, the younger son of Ivenez, Chaleb's brother, took it,
       14 and Chaleb gave him his daughter Ascha for a wife, and when
           she was going home to him, Gothoniel persuaded her to ask
           a field of her father : so she murmured, and with a loud voice
           said, as she was riding, Thou hast sent me away to the land
           of the south.   And Chaleb said to her, What is the matter with
        15 thee ?   And Ascha said to him, Give me, I beseech thee, a
           blessing.    Since thou hast sent me away to the land of the
           south, thou shouldst therefore give me a portion of water.
           Thereupon Chaleb gave her according to her desire, a portion
        16 of high lands, and a portion of low grounds.       Now the children
           of Jothor, the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up from the
           city of palm trees, with the children of Juda, into the wilder-
           ness, which is in the south of Juda, at the steep of Arad, and
           dwelt with this tribe.)
        17     Then Juda went with his brother Symeon, and smote the
           Chananites who dwelt in Sepheth, and utterly destroyed them,
       18 and called the name of that city Anathema.          Though Juda did
           not take possession of Gaza, nor the borders thereof, nor of
           Ascalon nor its borders, nor of Akkaron, nor its borders, nor
        19 of Azotus, nor the grounds about it ; yet the Lord was with
           him, and he took possession of the mountain, for they were
           not enabled to drive out the inhabitants of the vale, because
                                                                                                                ;;

         20 Eechab dissuaded them.                         Now when Chebron was given to
              Chaleb, as Moses had said, he had from thence taken posses-
              sion of the three cities of the children of Enak.
        21         Neither did the children of Benjamin dispossess the Jebu-
              sites, who dwelt at Jerusalem ; so the Jebusites have continu-
              ed to dwell at Jerusalem, with the children of Benjamin, to
              this day.
        22         With regard to the children of Joseph, they went up to
        23 Baithel, and the Lord was with them ; and they encamped
              near, and kept a watch upon Baithel.                            (Now the name of that
        24 city formerly was Louza.)                      And they who kept watch, looked,
              and behold a man came out of the city ; and they took him,
              and said to him, Shew us the way into the city, and we will
        25 shew thee mercy.                  So he shewed them the entrance into the
             city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword ; but
        20 they suffered the man and his family to depart.                                   And the man
             went to the land of Chettin, and built there a city, and called
             its name Louza, and this continueth to be its name to this day.
        27 But Manasses did not take Baithsan, [which is now called Scy-
             thopolis] nor its towns ; nor the lands about it ; nor Thenak, nor
             any of its towns ; nor the inhabitants ofDor, nor any of its towns ;
             nor the inhabitants of Balak, nor any of the habitations about it,
             nor its towns ; nor the inhabitants of Magedo, nor any of the
             habitations around it, nor its towns ; nor the inhabitants of Jeb-
             laam, nor any of its surrounding habitations, nor its towns
        28 So the Chananites took the opportunity to settle in that land
             but when Israel grew strong, they subjected the Chananites to
        29 tribute, but did not utterly root them out.                             Neither did Ephra-
             im drive out the Chananites who dwelt in Gazer.                                  So the Cha-
             nanites dwelt among them in Gazer, and became tributaries.
       30         Neither did Zabulon drive out the inhabitants of Kedron,
             nor the inhabitants of Domana ; so the Chananites continued
             to dwell among them and became tributary to them.
        31        Neither did Aser drive out the inhabitants of Akcho; but
             it became tributary to them ; nor the inhabitants of Dor ; nor the
             inhabitants of Sidon ; nor the inhabitants of Dalaph ; nor the
             Aschazites ; nor the Chebdaites ; nor the Naites ; nor the Ereo-
       32 ites.       So Aser dwelt in the midst of the Chananites who inha-
             bited that land, because he could not drive them out.
                                                                                                                                  ;

          33          Neither did Nephthaleim drive out the inhabitants of Baith-
                samys, nor the inhabitants of Baithanach.                                            So Nephthaleim
                dwelt in the midst of the Chananites who inhabited the land.
                And the inhabitants of Baithsamys and Baitheneth became tri-
                butary to them.
          34          As for the children of Dan, the Amorites harassed them
                on the mountains, for they did not suffer them to go down into
          35 the vale.             And the Amorites beganto settle on the shelly moun-
                tains, on that frequented by bears, and on that frequented by
                foxes, namely on Myrsinoni, and on Thalabin.                                              But the hand
                of the house of Joseph was heavy on the Amorites, and they
          36 became tributary to them.                                Now the border of the Amorites
                reached from the steep of Akrabin, from that rock and up-
                wards.
          II.          So there went up a messenger of the Lord from Galgal to
                Wailing, namely to Baithel, to the house of Israel, and said to
                them, Thus saith the Lord, I caused you to come up out of
                Egypt, and brought you into this land which I solemnly pro-
                mised your fathers, and I said I will never break my covenant
            2 with you ; therefore you shall not make a covenant with the
                inhabitants of this land, nor worship their gods ; but you shall
                break to pieces their graven images, and demolish their al-
            3 tars.        But you have not hearkened to my voice.                                           Because you
                have clone these things, therefore I have said, I will not drive
                them out from before you ; but they shall be curbs for you
            â€¢A  and their gods shall be to you a stumbling block.                                                And when
                the messenger of the Lord had spoken these words to all the
            5 children of Israel, the people wept aloud.                                          So they called the
                name of that place, Wailing, and there they sacrificed to the
                Lord.
            6          Now when Joshua had dismissed the people, and every
            7 man had gone to his inheritance to take possession of the land,
                though the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and
                all the days of the elders who had lived long with Joshua,
                and who knew all the great works which the Lord had done
            8 for Israel; yet when Joshua son of Nave, the servant of the
            9 Lord, died, at the age of a hundred and ten years, and they had
                buried him in the border of his inheritance at Thamnathares,
                 on mount Ephraim, on the north side of mount Gaas ; and
    Oh. II.                     JUDGES.
       all that generation was gathered to their fathers, and another
    10 generation arose after thein, who knew not the Lord, nor the
    11 works which he had done for Israel, the children of Israel did
    12 evil in the sight of the Lord, and served the Baalims.    They
        forsook the Lord the God of their fathers, who had brought
        them out of the land of Egypt, and went after other gods, after
        some of the gods of the nations around, and worshipped them,
    13 and provoked the Lord to wrath.     So when they forsook him,
    14 and served Baal, and the Astartees, the anger of the Lord was
        kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of
        spoilers, who spoiled them, and sold them into the hands of
    15 their enemies round about, so that they could no longer stand
        before their enemies.  Wherever they went, the hand of the
        Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had spoken, and
    16 as the Lord had solemnly denounced to them.       But when he
        had afflicted them grievously, the Lord raised up Judges, and
        the Lord saved them out of the hands of those who spoiled
    17 them.    When they indeed hearkened not to the judges, because
        they went a whoring after other gods, and worshipped them,
        and turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers
        had walkedâ€”did not act in obedience to the commands of the
     18 Lord ; still because the Lord raised up judges for them, there-
        fore the Lord was with the judge, and saved them out of the
        hand of their enemies all the days of the judge, because the
        Lord was mollified by their groaning, by reason of them who
     19 oppressed them and afflicted them.But when the judge died, and
        they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers,
        by going after other gods to serve them, and worship them, and
        would not quit their devices, nor their perverse ways, then was
    20 the anger of the Lord kindled against Israel, and he said, Because
        this nation have forsaken my covenant, which I gave in charge
     21 to their fathers, and have not hearkened to my voice, there-
        fore I will not henceforth drive out from before them a man
        of those nations which Joshua son of Nave left in the land.
     22     He indeed had spared them, that by them he might prove
        Israel whether they would, or would not, keep the ways of the
        Lord to walk therein, as their fathers had kept them : and hav-
        ing determined to spare those nations so as not to root them out
        speedily, the Lord did not deliver them into the hands of Joshua.
         III.                   JUDGES.
     Ch.
     III.    Now these are the nations which the Lord spared to
      2 prove Israel ; with an intent moreover, in regard to all those
        who would be unacquainted with the wars of Chanaan, to in-
        struct in the art of war, not only the present, but the succeed-
      3 ins: generations of the children of Israel, who knew not these
        thingsâ€”namely the five Satrapies of the Philistines, and all
        the Chananites, and the Sidonians, and the Evites who inha-
      4 bited Libanus from mount Aermon to Laboemath.       But while
        he was by them proving Israel, to know whether they would
        hearken to the commandments of the Lord, which he had given
      5 in charge to their fathers by the hand of Moses, the children of
        Israel dwelt among the Chananites, and the Chettites, and the
        Amorites, and the Pherezites, and the Evites, and the Jebu-
      6 sites, and they took their daughters to be their wives ; and gave
      7 their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.Thus the
         children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord.They forgot
         the Lord their God, and served the Baalims and the bowers.And
      8 the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he deliver-
         ed them into the hands of Cousarsathaim, king of Syrian Meso-
      9 potamia, and the children of Israel served him eight years.But
         when the Israelites cried to the Lord, he raised up a saviour for
         them, and delivered them, namely Gothoniel the youngest son
     10 of Kenez, Chaleb's brother. The Spirit of the Lord came upon
         him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war against Chou-
         sarsathaim, and the Lord delivered Chousarsathaim, king of
     11 Syrian Mesopotamia, into his hands ; and his hand prevailed
         against Chousarsathaim, and the land had rest.Forty years.
      12    But when Gothoniel son of Kenez died, the children of Israel
         proceeded to do evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord
         strengthened Eglon, king of Moab, against Israel, because they
      13 did evil in the sight of the Lord ; and he gathered to him all
         the Ammonites, and the Amalekites, and came and smote Is-
      14 rael, and took possession of the city of palm trees ; and the
         children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.
      15 But when the Israelites cried to the Lord, he raised up for them
         a deliverer, namely Aod son of Gera, the Jeminite, a man who
      16 could use both hands alike.When the children of Israel sent
         presents by him to Eglon king of Moab, Aod made for him-
         self a two edged dagger, a span long, and girded it under his
    Ch. III.                   JUDGES.
       military robe, on his right thigh, and went and presented the
    18 gifts to Eglon king of Moab.    Now Eglon was a very polite
       man.   So when Aod had made an end of presenting the gifts,
       and had sent away the men who carried the presents, he him-
       self returned from the sculptures which are back of Galgal.
    19 And Aod said, I have a private message to thee,         king.
    20 Whereupon Eglon said to him, Be silent.    And when he had
        sent away from him all his attendants, Aod went in to him.
       Now he was sitting alone in his summer parlour, up stairs.And
       Aod said, I have a message of God to thee, O king.      Upon
    21 which Eglon arose from his seat, near him.     And as he was
        rising, Aod stretched forth his left hand, and took the dagger
        from his right thigh, and plunged it into his belly, and thrust
    22 the haft in also after the blade, and the fat closed upon the
    23 blade, for he did not draw the dagger out of his belly. Then
       Aod went out by the stairs into the porch.Hewent out beyond
        the guards, having shut behind him the doors of the parlour,
    24 and bolted them.    And when he was gone, Eglon's servants
        came, but finding the doors of the parlour bolted, they said,
    25 Perhaps he is uncovering his feet in the summer parlour. And
        when they had waited till they were ashamed, and behold the
        parlour door is not opened, they took the key and opened it,
    26 and behold their lord was fallenâ€”dead upon the floor!     But
        Aod escaped while they were in confusion, and none attended
        to him ; and having passed the sculptures he got safe to Setei-
    27 rotha.  And when Aod came to the land of Israel, he sounded
       a horn on Mount Ephraim : and the children of Israel went
    28 down with him from the mountain, and he before them.      And
        he said to them, Follow me down, for the Lord God hath de-
        livered our enemiesâ€”Moab into our hands.    So they followed
        him down, and took possession of the fords of the Jordan before
    29 Moab, and suffered not a man to pass.  And they slew of Moab
        that day about ten thousand men, their whole strength, even
    30 every man of valour.   Not a man escaped.   So Moab was hum-
        bled that day, under the hand of Israel, and the land had rest.
     31 Eighty years.  Now Aod judged them till he died.   And after
        him arose Samegar, son of Dinach, who had slain of the Phi-
        listines six hundred men with an ox goad, and who also saved
        Israel.

           IV.              But the children of Israel proceeded again to do evil in
              2 the sight of the Lord, when Aod was dead, and the Lord de-
                  livered Israel into the hand of Jabin king of Chanaan, who
                  reigned in Asor.                       Now the captain general of his army was Si-
              3 sara, and he dwelt at Arisoth of the nations.                                                       And the children
                  of Israel cried to the Lord, for he had nine hundred chariots of
                  iron, and he oppressed Israel grievously, twenty years.
              I           Now Debbora, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, judged
              5 Israel at that time, and had taken her seat under the palm grove
                   of Debbora, between Rama and Baithel, on mount Ephraim; and
              b*   the children of Israel went up to her for judgment.                                                              And Deb-
                   bora sent for Barak, son of Abineem, of Kades-Nepthaleim,
                   and said to him, Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded
                   thee ?          Go therefore to mount Thabor, and take with thee ten
                   thousand men of the children of Nephthaleini, and of the chil-

                   Kison, Sisara the captain general of Jabin's army, with his cha-
              8 riots, and his multitude, and deliver him into thy hands.                                                                Where-

                   if thou will not go, I will not go : for I do not know the day
              9 when the Lord would prosper the angel with me.                                                                         And she

                   which thou takest, the honour of the victory will not be thine
                   for the Lord will deliver Sisara into the hands of a woman.                                                                      So
            10 Debbora arose, and went with Barak, of Kades.                                                                     And Barak
                   called out Zabulon and Nephthaleini from Kades, and there
                   went up after him ten thousand men, and Debbora went up
            11 with him.                    Now Chaber, the Kinite, had removed from Kaina,
                   from among the children of Jobab, Moses' father in law, and
                   had pitched his tent in the oak grove which is near Kades.
                                                             T      told that Barak, son of Abineem, was
            12 And when Sisara was
            13 gone up to mount Thabor, he called out all his chariots, nine
                   hundred chariots of iron, and all his people with him, from Ari-
            14 soth of the nations to the brook Kison.                                                       And Debbora said to
                   Barak, Arise, for this is the day, on which the Lord hath de-
                   livered Sisara into thy hand ; for the Lord will march before
            15 thee.              So Barak went down from mount Thabor with ten thou-
                   sand men after him ; And the Lord discomfited Sisara, and all
                   his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword, be-
                                                                                                   ;                                    ;

          16 fore Barak.                 And Sisara alighted from his chariot and fled on
                foot.        And Barak pursued the chariots, and the army, to Ari-
                soth of the nations.                    And the whole army of Sisara fell by the
                 edge of the sword.                    There was not even a man left.
          17           Now Sisara had fled, on foot, to the tent of Jael, the wife
                of Chaber the Kinite ; for there was peace between Jabin king
          18 of Asor, and the house of Chaber the Kinite.                                                    And Jael went
                out to meet Sisara, and said to him, Turn in my lord; turn
                in to me.            Be not afraid.                So he turned in to herâ€”into the tent
          19 and she covered him with a mantle.                                             And Sisara said to her
                Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.
                Whereupon she opened the milk vessel, and gave him drink,
          20 and then covered him.                              And Sisara said to her, Stand, I pray
                thee, at the door of the tent, and if any man come to thee and
                ask thee, saying, Is there a man here ? thou shalt say, There is
          21 not.           Then Jael, the wife of Chaber, took the pin of the tent,
                and a mallet in her hand, and went in softly to him, and drove
                the pin into his temple, and it went through into the ground.
          22 And he fainted away, and was involved in darkness.                                                       And when
                he was dead, behold Barak came in pursuit of Sisara.                                                             And
                Jael went out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will
                shew thee the man whom thou seekest.                                               So he went in with
                her, and behold Sisara lay dead with the pin in his temples.
          20 So God, on that day, subdued Jabin king of Chanaan before
                the children of Israel, and the hand of the Israelites prospered,
                and prevailed against Jabin king of Chanaan, until they utterly
                destroyed him.
          V.           Then sung Debbora, and Barak son of Abineem, on that
                day, saying,
                       Kevelation was revealed in Israel
                       When the people offered thank offerings
                               Praise ye the Lord.
            3          Hear,           kings ! and give ear,                       princes !
                       I will sing to I am, to the Lord I am ;
                       I will sing to the Lord, the God of Israel.
            4                       Lord ! in thy march out of Seir,
                       When thou didst remove from the fields of Edom
                                                                                                                    ;
                       The earth trembled, and heaven distilled dew
                                                                                                            ;
                       The clouds also distilled water.
                                                                           ;                â€”;â€”;                   â€”

         Ob.
           5         The mountains shook at the presence of the Lord Eloi,
                     That Sina, at the presence of the Lord God of Israel.
           6                 In the days of Sarnegar son of Anathâ€”in the days of
                                Jael;
                     They forsook the high, ways and travelled in bye paths
                     They travelled in crooked winding roads.
           7         The mighty men of Israel were faint hearted
                     They were faint hearted till Debbora arose
                     Until there arose a mother in Israel.
          8                  They had chosen new gods
                     Then was war made upon the cities of chiefs, if a buckler
                                 was seen,
                     Or a spear among forty thousand in Israel.
           9         My heart was fixed on what were enjoined Israel.
                     Ye among the people who offer thank offerings,
                    Praise ye the Lord.
         10          Ye who have mounted your asses at noon day,
                     Ye who sit in the seat of judgment,
                     Ye who travel the high ways to the publick assemblies,
         11          Make j)roclamation on the road, on account of the voice
                                 of them
                     Who shout amidst the drawers of water.
                     There let them rehearse gracious deliverances.
                     Increase,           Lord, gracious deliverances in Israel.
                     Then went the people of the Lord down to their cities.
         12                  Awake, awake, Debbora !                             Awake, awake, utter a
                                 song.
                     Arise, Barak !             And lead thy captivity captive, son of Abi-
                                 neem
         13          Then went down a remnant to the mighty
                     The Lord's people went down to him with my valiant men.
         14          Ephraim rooted out them in Amelek
                                                                                    ;
                     After thee was Benjamin with thy people
                     With me went down the scouting Machirites,
                     And from Zabulon, they who array with the marshal's staff.
         15          The leaders in Issachar also were with Debbora and Barak.
                     Thus was Barak in the vales.
                             He had sent a courier to the factions of Beuben.
                     The bold hearted are just setting out.

         16          Why did they tarry among their sheepfolds?
                     Was it to hear the bleating of their flocks ?
                     For the divisions of Eeuben, there were great searchings of
                                  heart.
        1            Why abode Galaad beyond the Jordan where he dwelt?
                     And why doth Dan sojourn in ships ?
                     Aser seated himself on the sea shore,
                     And chuseth to dwell in his extreme borders.
         18          The people of Zabulon jeoparded their lives to death
                     And Nephthaleim came to the high places of the field.
         19                   Kings had drawn themselves up in array.
                     Then fought the kings of Chanaan at Thanach
                     At the waters of Mageddo ;
                     They had not received the gift of silver.
        20           The stars from heaven were drawn up in array
                     From their orbits they fought against Sisara.
        21           The torrent of Kison swept them away
                      The ancient torrentâ€”the torrent Kison.
                      My mighty soul shall trample them down.
         22           When the feet of the horse were entangled,
                      With precipitate speed, they who were able, fled.
        23                    Curse Meroz, said the messenger of the Lord.
                      Curse ye it bitterly.
                      Cursed be every one who dwelleth therein,
                      Because they came not to the help of the Lord
                      To the help of the Lord among the mighty.
         24                   Blessed among women be Jael^the wife of Chaber the

                      Above women in tents may she be blessed.
         25           He asked for water ; she gave him milk ;
                      From her churning vessel she brought him whey.
         26           She stretched forth her left hand to the tent pin
                      And her right hand to the workman's mallet.
                      And with the mallet she smote Sisara.
                      She drove the pin into his head and smote him
                      She drove the pin quite through his temples.
         27           At her feet he had thrown himself down
                      He prostrated himself, and fell asleep at her feet.
                      Throwing himself down, he had prostrated himself.
                                                     ;            â€”             â€”                    !

                    As lie lay there he fell and finished his course.
         28                 Through a window the mother of Sisara looked
                                       earnestly
                    Out of that of an archer she cried,
                    Why is his chariot so long a coming ?
                    Why tarry the wheels of his chariot ?
         29         Her wise ladies answered her
                    Nay she returned an answer to herself,
         30         Shall they not find him dividing spoil ?
                    Will he shew compassion to the head of a man ?
                    Sisara shall have spoils of richest dyes
                    Spoils of richest dyes of needle work.
                    Rich dyes of embroidery are the spoils for his neck
         31                 So perish all thine enemies,                    Lord,
                    But let them who love thee be like
                    The going forth of the Sun in his might.
         32         So the land had rest.               Forty years.
          VI.         Again the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the
               Lord, and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Madiam
               seven years.            And the hand of Madiam prevailed against Is-
               rael, so that because of Madiam, the Israelites made for them-
               selves those dens which are in the mountains, and those caves
           3 and strong holds in cliffs.                   And when the Israelites had sown,
               Madiam and Amelek came up, and the children of the east
               came up with them, and encamped against them, and destroy-
           4 ed their fruits, all the way to Gaza.                           In all the land of Israel
               they did not leave sustenance for life, nor among the herds
           5 a bull or a jack ass.               For they came up with cattle.                      And their
               tents were pitched like locusts for multitude : and they and
               their camels were innumerable.                        And they came into the land
           6 of Israel, and wasted it ; so that Israel was greatly impover-
           7 ished by the Madianites.                       And when the children of Israel
           8 cried to the Lord because of Madiam, the Lord sent a prophet
               to the children of Israel, and he said to them, Thus saith the
               Lord the God of Israel.                    It was I who brought you up from
           9 the land of Egypt.                I brought you out of a house of your bon-
               dage, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and
               out of the hand of all those who are afflicting you, and drove them
               out from before you, and gave you this their land, and said
     Ch. VI.                           JUDGES.
     10 to you, I the Lord am your God.           You shall not fear the gods
         of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.              But you have not
         hearkened to my voice.
     11      Then there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under the
         fir tree, which is at Ephratha, in the land of father Joas, the
         Esdrite.    Now Gideon, his son, was beating out corn in the wine
     12 press, with an intent to flee from before Madiam.            And the an-
         gel of the Lord appeared to him, and said to him, The Lord
     13 is with theeâ€”the Mighty Lord of Hosts.               Whereupon Gideon
         said to him, With me, my lord !           But if the Lord is with us,
         why have these evils befallen us ?        And where are all his wond-
         rous works, of which our fathers have told us, saying, Hath
         not the Lord brought us up out of Egypt ?              But he hath now
     14 cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Madiam.                Then
         the angel of the Lord turned towards him and said, Go in this
         thy might, and thou shalt save Israel out of the hand of Ma-
     15 diam.     Behold I have sent thee.        Upon which Gideon said to
         him, Me, my lord !      How can I save Israel ?        Behold my thou-
         sand is weak in Manasses ; and I am the least in my father's
     16 house.     And the angel of the Lord said to him, The Lord will
         be with thee, and thou shalt smite Madiam like one man.
     17 Whereupon Gideon said to him, If I have found favour in thy
         sight, and thou wilt now do for me all that thou hast said to
         me, go not away, I beseech thee, from this place till I come to
     18 thee, and bring out the sacrifice, and set it before thee.            And
     19 he said, I will assuredly tarry till thou return.          Thereupon Gi-
         deon went, and prepared a kid of the goats, and unleavened
         cakes of an epha of barley meal ; and having put the flesh in a
         basket, and the soup in a pot, he brought them out to him un-
     20 der the fir tree, and set them before him.            Then the angel of
         God said to him, Take the flesh, and unleavened cakes,
         and lay them on that rock, and pour out the soup close by.
     21 And when he had done so, the angel of the Lord stretched
         out the point of the staff in his hand, and touched the flesh and
         the unleavened cakes ; and fire came up out of the rock, and
         consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes ; and the angel
         of the Lord vanished out of his sight.
    22       When Gideon saw that it was an angel of the Lord, he
         said, Alas ! alas !     Lord, my lord !     For have I seen the an-

      Ch.
      23 gel of the Lord face to face.And the Lord said to him, Peace
      24 be to thee. Fear not.  Thou shalt not die. LTpon which Gide-
         on built there an altar to the Lord, and called it, Peace of the
         Lord.  To this day it is still at Ephratha, which belonged to fa-
      25 ther Esdri. And on that same night the Lord said to him, Take
         the young bullâ€”the bull belonging to thy father, the second
         bull of seven years old, and having demolished the altar of Baal
         which is for thy father, and destroyed the arbour near it, thou
      26 shalt build an altar to the Lord thy God, on the top of Maozi,
         in the parade ; and thou shalt take the second bull, and offer
         whole burnt offerings on the wood of the arbour which thou
      27 hast demolished.  So Gideon took ten men of his servants, and
         did as the Lord had spoken to him.   But as he was afraid of
         doing it by day, because of his father's house, and the men of
      28 the city, he did it by night.And when the men ofthe city arose
         early in the morning, and lo ! the altar of Baal was pulled down,
         and the arbour near it destroyed, and they saw the second bull
      29 which he had offered on the altar which he had built, they said
         one to another, Who hath done this ? And when they had
         made diligent inquiry, and found, and knew that Gideon son
         of Joas had done the deed, the men of the city said to Joas,
      30 Bring out thy son, and let him be put to death, because he hath
         pulled down the altar of Baal, and because he hath destroyed
      31 the arbour which was beside it.   Whereupon Gideon son of
         Joas said to all the men who had risen up against him, Do you
         now plead for Baal, and will you save him ? Whoever shall plead
         for Baal, let him be put to death this morning. If he is a god,
         let him plead for himself, because somebody hath pulled down
      32 his altar. So this gave him on that day the name of Jerobaal, as
         he said, Let Baal plead for himself, because this altar of his is
          pulled down.
      33     Now all Madiam, and Amalek, and the children of the east,
          had assembled together and encamped in the valley of Jesrael.
      34 And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he sounded
      35 a horn, and called out Abiezer after him.   He also sent mes-
          sengers to all Manasses, and through Aser, and through Za-
      36 bulon, and through Nephthaleim.    And when they came up to
      37 meet him, Gideon said to God, If thou wilt save Israel by my
          hand, as thou hast spoken, behold I lay this fleece of wool on
                                                                                                               ;
       Ch. VII.                                    JUDGES.
            the threshing floor ; If there be dew on this fleece only, and all
            the ground be dry, then I shall know that thou wilt save Israel
       38 by my hand as thou hast spoken.                            This was accordingly done.
            And when he arose early the next morning he pressed the
            fleece, and wringed out the dew from the fleece, a bowl full of
       39 water.         Then Gideon said to God, Let not, I beseech thee, thy
            anger be kindled against me : let me, I pray thee, make one
            trial more with the fleece ; and let it be dry on the fleece only,
       40 and on all the ground let there be dew.                             And God did so that
            night ; and it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground
            there was dew.
       VII.          Then Jerobaal (the same is Gideon) arose early in the
            morning, and all the people with him, and they encamped by
            the well Arad.            Now the camp of Madiam was to the north of
         2 him, at the foot of Gabaathamorai, in the valley.                               And the Lord
            said to Gideon, The people with thee are too numerous for me
            to deliver Madiam into their hands.                           Perhaps they may boast
         3 against me saying, My own hand hath saved me.                                       Now there-
            fore speak in the hearing of the people, and say, If any man is
            fearful, or timorous, let him depart from mount Galaad.                                          So
            there returned of the people twenty two thousand : and ten
         4 thousand were left.                 And the Lord said to Gideon, The peo-
            ple are still too numerous : bring them to the water, and I will
            purge them there for thee.                   And it shall be that of whomsoever
            I say, This man shall go with thee ; he shall go with thee.                                   And
            of whomsoever I say, This man shall not go with theeâ€”he shall
         5 not go with thee.                So he took the people to the water.                           And
            the Lord said to Gideon, Whosoever shall lap of the water
            with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him thou shalt set apart
            likewise every one who shall bow down on his knees to drink.
         6 And it came to pass that the number of them who lapped, by
            putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men .
            but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to
         7 drink water.            Then the Lord said to Gideon, By these three
            hundred men who have lapped I will save you, and deliver
            Madiam into thy hands.                  Let all those people therefore go, every
         8 man to his home.               So they took the people's provisions at their
            hands, and their trumpets ; and having dismissed all the rest
            of Israel, every man to his tent, he retained the three hundred
                 vol. I.                                  3 G
      Ch. VII.                  JUDGES.
       9    Now the camp of Madiam was below him in the vale.  And
         that night the Lord said to him, Arise, and go down through
      10 the camp, for I have delivered it into thy hand.But if thou
         art afraid to go down ; go thou, and thy servant Phara, to the
      11 edge of the camp, and hear what they will say, and afterwards
         thy hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp.So
         he and his servant Phara went down to a company of fifty, who
      12 were in the camp.   Now Madiam, and Amalek, and all the
         children of the east lay along in the valley, like grasshoppers,
         for multitude, and their camels were innumerable.They were
      13 like the sand on the sea shore for multitude.And when Gideon
         drew near, behold there was a man telling his comrade a
         dream.  And he said, Behold I have had a dream.  I thought
         I saw a cake of barley bread rolling about in the camp
         of Madiam, and it came to this tent, and smote it, and it
      14 fell. It indeed overturned it, and the tent fell. And his
         comrade answered, and said, Is not this the sword of Gideon,
         son of Joas the Israelite ?God hath delivered into his hand
      15 Madiam and all this camp. And when Gideon heard the dream,
         and the interpretation of it, he worshipped the Lord, and re-
         turned to the camp of Israel, and said, Arise, for the Lord hath
      16 delivered into our hand the camp of Madiam.  Then he divid-
         ed the three hundred men into three companies, and put a
         trumpet in every man's hand, and empty pitchers with lamps
      17 in the pitchers, and said to them, Attend to me and do as I
         do.  And whatever I do when I come to the edge of the camp,
      18 see that you do the same. When I sound the horn, I and all
         with me ; sound ye your horns, all around the camp, and say,
      19 For the Lord and for Gideon. So Gideon, and the three hun-
         dred men who were with him, came to the border of the camp,
         at the beginning of the middle watch, and having alarmed the
         guards, they sounded the horns, and shook the pitchers which
      20 were in their hands.   And when the three companies had
         sounded the horns, they broke the pitchers, and held the flam-
         beaus in their left hands, and their trumpets in their right, and
         shouted, A sword for the Lord and for Gideon, and stood
      21 every man in his place around the camp. And while the whole
         camp was running, and making signals, and fleeing, they
         sounded the three hundred horns; and the Lord set every
           VIII.                      JUDGES.
      Oh.
      22 man's sword against his fellow throughout the whole camp.
          And when the host had fled as far as Bethseed, Tagaratha-
      23 Abelmeoula near Tabath, the men of Israel assembled from
          jN ephthaleim, and from Aser, and from all Manasses, and pursu-
      24 ed Madiam.      And Gideon sent messengers through all Ephraim,
          saying, Haste down to meet Madiam, and take possession of
      25 the waters, even to Baithera, and the Jordan.          Upon which the
         men of Ephraim assembled, and, before the Madianites came up,
          got possession of the waters, even to Baithera, and the Jordan,
         and they took the princes of Madiam, Oreb and Zeb, and they
         slew Oreb at Sour Oreb, and Zeb they slew at Jakeph Zeph.
         And having pursued Madiam, they brought the heads of Oreb
      VIII.     and Zeb to Gideon, from the border of the Jordan.             And
         the man Ephraim said to Gideon, What is this that thou hast
         done to us in not calling upon us when thou wentest out to
       2 light Madiam ?      And they spoke sharply to him.          But he said
       o to them, What have I now done in comparison of you?                     Is
          not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abie-
          zer?   The Lord hath delivered into your hand the princes of
         Madiam, Oreb and Zeb.           Now what have I been enabled to
         do in comparison of you ?        And upon his saying this, their an-
       â€¢Iger against him abated.        And when Gideon came to the Jor-
         dan, and crossed it, he and the three hundred men who were
       5 with him, hungry, but still pursuing, he said to the men of
         Sokchoth, Give, I pray you, bread to feed the people who fol-
          low me, for they are fainty, and behold I am pursuing Zebee
       6 and Salmana, the kings of Madiam.             And the chiefs of Sok-
          choth said, Is the hand of Zebee and Salmana now in thy hand,
       7 that we should give thy army bread ?          Thereupon Gideon said,
         Eor this, when the Lord hath delivered Zebee and Salmana
         into my hand, I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wil-
       8 derness, even with those of Barkenim.          And he went up thence
          to Phanuel, and spoke to them in like manner ; and the men
          of Phanuel answered him as the men of Sokchoth had done.
       9 Whereupon Gideon said to the men of Phanuel, When I re-
      10 turn in peace, I will demolish that tower.        Now Zebee and Sal-
          mana were at Karkar, and their army with them, about fifteen
         thousand men, all who were left of the whole host of the fo-
          reign tribes, they who had fallen being a hundred and twenty
      Ch. VIII.                   JUDGES.
      11 thousand men who drew the sword.      So Gideon went up by
         the way of them who dwell in tents, eastward of Nabai and
         Jegebal, and smote the camp, though the camp thought thein-
      12 selves secure. And Zebee and Salmana fled, and he pursued them,
         and took the two kings of Madiam, Zebee and Salmana, and dis-
      13 comfited the whole host. And when Gideon, son of Joas, returned
      14 from the engagement, back from the engagement at Ares ; he
         caughta young manof the men of Sokchoth, and inquired of him,
         and he wrote down for him the names of the chiefs of Sokchoth,
      15 and of their elders, seventy seven men.     And when Gideon
         came to the chiefs of Sokchoth, he said, Behold Zebee and
         Salmana, with whom you upbraided me, saying, Is the hand of
         Zebee and Salmana now in thy hand, that we should give bread
      16 to the men with thee who are fainty ?  Then he took the elders
         of the city, and scourged them with the thorns of the wilder-
         ness, even with those of Barkenim.   And when he had scourg-
      17 ed the men of that city, in the midst of them, he demolished
      18 the tower of Phanuel, and slew the men of that city.   Then he
         said to Zebee and Salmana, What sort of men were they whom
         ye slew at Thabor?   And they said, As thou art so were they.
      19 They resembled the children of a king.     Whereupon Gideon
         said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother.     As the
         Lord liveth, if you had saved them alive, I would not have
      20 killed you.  Then he said to Jether his first born, Arise and
         slay them.  But the youth drew not his sword, for he was afraid,
      21 for he was yet very young.    Whereupon Zebee and Salmana
         said, Arise thou thyself, and fall upon us, for thou hast the
         strength of a man.   So Gideon arose, and slew Zebee and Sal-
         mana, and took the ornaments which were on the necks of
      22 their camels.  Then Israel said to Gideon, My lord, rule over
         us, both thou and thy son, and thy son's son, because thou
      23 hast saved us out of the hand of Madiam.    But Gideon said to
         them, I will not rule over you.    Nor shall my son rule over
      24 you.  The Lord will rule over you.  Then Gideon said to them.
         I have a favour to ask of you.    Give me every man the ear-
         rings of his spoils ; for the enemy wore gold ear-rings, be-
      25 cause they were Ismaelites.  And they said, We will give them
         cheerfully.  So he spread his mantle, and they threw thereon,
      26 every man, the ear-rings of his spoils ; and the weight of the
                                                                                                               ;
       Ch. IX.                                     JUDGES.
            gold ear-rings, which he had requested, was a thousand seven
            hundred shekels of gold, exclusive of the necklaces, and
            bracelets, and the garments, and purple robes, which were on
            the kings of Madiam, and exclusive of the chains which were
      27 about the neck of their camels.                         And of this Gideon made an
            ephod, and set it up in his city in Ephratha ; and all Israel
            went there a whoring after it, and it became a stumbling block
            to Gideon, and his house.
      28         Thus Madiam was subdued before the children of Israel,
            so that they never any more raised their head.                                And the land
      29 had rest forty years during the days of Gideon.                                  And Jerobaal
            son of Joas, went and dwelt at his house.
      30         Now Gideon had seventy sons who proceeded from his
      31 loins, for he had many wives.                         He had moreover a concubine,
            in Sychem, and she also bore him a son, aud called his name
      32 Abimelech.              And Gideon son of Joas died in his city, and was
            buried in the tomb of his father Joas, in Ephratha Abiesdri.
      33 And when Gideon was dead the children of Israel turned, and
            went a whoring after the Baalims, and made for themselves a
       34 covenant with Baal, that he should be their god.                                  The children
            of Israel neither remembered the Lord God who had delivered
            them out of the hands of all those who afflicted them round
            about ; nor did theyideal kindly with the house of Jerobaal, namely
            Gideon, according to all the good which he had done for Israel.
       IX.          For when Abinielech, son of Jerobaal, went to Sychem, to
            his mother's brethren, and spoke to them, and to all the rela-
            tions of the house of his mother's father, saying, Speak I pray
            you in the hearing of all the men of Sychem, Which is best for
            yonâ€”that seventy men, even all the sons of Jerobaal, should
            rule over youâ€”or that one man should rule over you?                                           Ke-
         3 member also that I am your bone and your flesh, his mother's
            brethren spoke all these words for him in the hearing of the
            men of Sychem, and their heart inclined to follow Abimelech
         4 for they said, He is our brother.                         So they gave him seventy
            weight of silver, out of the house of Baal-berith ; and Abime-
            lech hired for himself vain profligate men, who followed him ;
         5 and he went to his father's house at Ephratha, and slew his
            brothers, the sons of Jerobaal, seventy men, on one stone.                                     Jo-
            thain indeed, the youngest son of Jerobaal was left, for he bad

        6 hid himself.     Then all the Sychemites, and all the house of
          Bethrnaalo, assembled and went and proclaimed Abimelech
           king, near the oak grove, which was invented for the assem-
        7 bling at Sychem.      When the news of this was told Jotham, he
          went and stood on the top of mount Garizin, and raising his
           voice, he wept, and said to them, Hear me, ye Sychemites, that
        8 God may hear you.       The trees went forth to anoint a king over
        9 them, and they said to the olive, Reign thou over us.         But the
          olive said to them, Shall I leave my fatness with which men
       10 honour God, and go to wave over the trees ?           Then the trees
       11 said to the fig tree, Come thou and reign over us.         But the fig-
          tree said to them, Shall I leave my sweetness, and good fruit,
       J 2 and go to wave over the trees ?     Then the trees said to the vine,
       13 Come and reign over us.        But the vine said to them, Shall I
           leave my wine, which cheereth gods and men, and go to wave
       14 over the trees ?    Then all the trees said to the bramble, Come
       15 thou and reign over us.       Upon which the bramble said to the
           trees, If in truth you anoint me to reign over you, come and
           stand in my shade ; if not, let a fire go out from me, and con-
       16 sume the cedars of Lebanon.        Now therefore if you have acted
           with truth and uprightness in making Abimelech king ; and if
           you have dealt righteously with Jerobaal, and his house, or
       17 done to him according to the deserving of his handâ€”As my
           father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered
       18 you out of the hand of Madiam, and you have risen up against
           my father's house, and have slain his seventy sons on one stone,
           and made Abimelech, the son of his concubine, king over the
       19 men of Sychem, because he is your brotherâ€”if therefore you
           have this day acted with truth, and uprightness, in regard to
           Jerobaal, and his house, may you have joy in Abimelech, and
       20 he have joy in you : but if not ; may a fire come out from Abi-
           melech, and consume the Sychemites, and the house of Beth-
           maalo ; and may a fire come out from the Sychemites, and the
       21 house of Bethmaalo, and consume Abimelech.              Then Jotham
           fled, and left his country, and went to Baier, and dwelt there for
           fear of his brother Abimelech.
       22      Now when Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,
        23 God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the Sychemites,
           and the Sychemites dealt treacherously with the house of Abi-
                              JUDGES.
    Ch. IX.
    24 melech, that he might bring the injustice done to the seventy
        sons of Jerobaal, and lay their blood, on the head of their
        brother Abimelech, who slew them, and on the Sychemites be-
    25 cause they strengthened his hands to kill his brothers. And
       the Sychemites set men in ambush for him on the tops of the
       mountains, and they robbed all that came along by them that
    26 way : and king Abimelech had information of this.  But when
        Gaal son of Jobel came with his brethren, and joined the
       Sychemites, the men of Sychem put confidence in him, and
       went out into the fields, and gathered their vintage, and trod
    27 out their grapes, and uttered the usual shouts of joy, and car-
       ried offerings to the house of their god, and ate and drank,
    28 and cursed Abimelech.   And Gaal son of Jobel said, Who is
        Abimelech ?  And who is the son of Sychem, that we should
        serve him?  Is not this son of Jerobaal and Zebul his over-
       seerâ€”his slave, with all the men of Emmor, the property of
    29 father Sychem ?  Why then should we serve him ?     that this
        people were under my hand !   I would depose Abimelech, and
    30 say to him, Increase thy army, and come out.   When Zebul,
        the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal, son of Jobel, he
    81 was fired with indignation, and sent messengers secretly to
        Abimelech, saying, Behold Gaal, son of Jobel, with his bre-
        thren, are come to Sychem, and lo ! they have set the city
    32 against thee. Now therefore arise by night, thou, and the peo-
    33 pie with thee, and lie in wait in the fields ; so that in the morn-
        ing, soon as the sun is up, thou mayst rise betimes, and ap-
        proach the city, and behold when he and the people with him
        go out, and meet thee, thou shalt do to him as the occasion
    34 may direct.   Accordingly Abimelech arose by night, and all
        the people with him, and lay in wait against Sychem, in four
    35 companies.  And Gaal son of Jobel went out and stood at the
        entrance of the gate of the city, and Abimelech, and the people
    36 with him, arose from the ambush.  And when Gaal son of Jo-
        bel saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold there are people
        coming down from the tops of the mountains.  And Zebul said
        to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains like men.
    37 And Gaal spoke again, and said. Behold there are people com-
        ing clown, westward, from the middle ground, and there is ano-
    38 ther company coming by the way of Elon-maonenim.       Then
        Zebul said to him, Where is now thy mouth with which thou
           IX.                   JUDGES.
      Ch.
         saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him ?   Is not
         this the people whom thou didst despise ? Go out now, I pray
      39 thee, and fight them.  Whereupon Gaal went out before the
      40 men of Sychem, and drew up in array against Abimelech, and
         Abimelech pursued him, and he fled from before him, and there
      41 fell many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.Then Abi-
         melech went to Aremo, and Zebul expelled Gaal and his bre-
      42 thren, that they should not dwell in Sychem.    And the next
         morning the people went out to the fields. When this was told
      43 Abimelech, he took the people, and divided them into three
         companies, and lay in wait in the fields.  And when he had
         taken a view, and behold the people came out of the city, he
      44 rose upon them, and smote them ; and Abimelech, and the offi-
         cers who were with him, rushed forward and took post at the
         entrance of the gate of the city, and the two other companies
      45 fell upon all in the fields, and smote them.  And Abimelech
         fought against the city the whole day, and having taken the
         city, he slew the people in it, and demolished the city, and
      46 sowed it with salt. Now when all the men of the tower of Sy-
      47 chem heard this, they repaired to the fort Baithel-berith.And
         when it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of
         Sychem were assembled together, he went up to mount Sel-
      48 mon, with all the people who were with him.   And Abimelech
         took an ax in his hand, and cut a bough of a tree, and took it
         and put it on his shoulder, and said to the people who were
      49 with him, Haste and do as Iâ€”what you have seen me do.      So
         they cut every man a bough, and went after Abimelech, and
         piled them up against the fort, and set the fort on fire about
         them, so that all the men of the tower of Sychem died, about
      50 a thousand men and women.        Then Abimelech went from
      51 Baithel-berith, and encamped against Thebes, and took it.But
         there was a strong tower in the midst of the city, and all the
         men and the women of the city fled thither, and shut the gate
      52 after them, and went up to the top of the tower. And Abime-
         lech came to the tower, and when they opposed him, Abime-
      53 lech went near to the gate of the tower to set it on fire, and a
         woman threw a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head,
      54 and fractured his scull ; whereupon he cried hastily to the young
         man who carried his armour, and said to him, Draw my sword,
                                    JUDGES.
     Oh. X.
    55 and kill me, that they may not say, A woman killed him.              So
        his servant run him through, and he died.         And when the men
        of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they went every man
    i>6 to his place.    Thus God turned upon Abimelech the wicked-
        ness which he had committed against his father, in killing his
    57 seventy brothers.     God also turned upon the head of the men
        of Sychem all their wickedness, and upon them came the curse
        of Jotham son of Jerobaal.
    X.      And after Abimelech, there arose to defend Israel, Thola
        son of Phuah, the son of his father's brother, a man of Issachar,
      2 and he dwelt at Samir on mount Ephraim.            And when he had
        judged Israel twenty three years, he died, and was buried at
      3 Samir.    And after him arose Jair, the Galaadite, and he judged
      4 Israel twenty two years.     Now he had thirty two sons, who rode
        on thirty two ass-colts, and they had thirty two cities, which
        are called, Thefolds of Jair, to this day, in the land of Galaad.
      5 And Jair died, and was buried at Kamnon.           And the children
      6 of Israel proceeded again to do evil in the sight of the Lord,
        and served the Baals, and the Astartes, and the gods of Aram,
        and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of
        Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the Lord,
      7 and did not serve him.        Whereupon the anger of the Lord
        was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the
      8 hands of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of
        Ammon, and they afflicted, and oppressed the children of Is-
        rael, at that time eighteen years, even all the children of Israel
        who were on the border of the Jordan, in the land of the Amo-
     9 rites, in Galaad.     Moreover the children of Ammon crossed
        the Jordan to fight against Juda, and Benjamin, and against
        Ephraim, so that the Israelites were grievously oppressed.
    10 And when the children of Israel cried to the Lord, and said,
        We have sinned against thee, because we have forsaken God,
    11 and served Baals, the Lord said to the Israelites, Did I not de-
        liver you out of Egypt, and from the Amorites and the Ammon-
        ites, and the Philistines, and the Sidonians, and Amalek, aud
    12 Madiam, who afflicted you ?        When you cried to me, I saved
    13 you out of their hands.      But you have forsaken me, and served
    14 other gods, therefore I will deliver you no more.        Go and cry to
        the gods which you have chosen for yourselves, and let them
            vol. i.                     3 H
      Ch. XL                   JUDGES.
      15 deliver you in the time of your tribulation.And the children
         of Israel said to the Lord, We have sinned.Do thou thyself
         to us, whatever seemeth good in thine eyes, but deliver us this
      16 time. And they put away the strange gods from among them,
         and served the Lord alone. Whereupon his heart relented at
         the distress of Israel.
      17    Now the children of Ammon had gone up, and encamped
      18 in Galaad ; and the children of Israel assembled and encamped
         at the watch tower.And the people, the chiefs of Galaad, said
         to one another, Whoever will undertake to fight the chil-
         dren of Ammon, he shall be ruler over all the inhabitants of
         Galaad.
     XL      Now Jephthae, the Galaadite, was at the head of an army.
        He was the son of a harlot, who bore Jephthae to Galaad.
      2 Galaad's wife also bore him sons ; and when the wife's sons
        grew up, they thrust out Jephthae, and said to him, Thou shalt
        have no inheritance in the house of our father ; for thou art the
      3 son of a concubine. LTpon which Jephthae fled from the face
        of his brothers, and dwelt in the land of Tob.And there were
        gathered to Jephthae men of desperate fortunes, who went out
      4 with him.   Xow when the children of Ammon came out in
      5 array to fight against Israel, the elders of Galaad went to bring
        Jephthae from the land of Tob, and they said to him, Come and
      7 be our leader that we may fight the Ammonites ; whereupon
        Jephthae said to the elders of Galaad, Have you not hated me,
        and driven me from my father's house, and sent me away from
        you ?  Why then are you come to me now when you are in dis-
      8 tress ? And the elders of Galaad said to him, It is for this very
        reason, that we have now come to thee. Therefore thou must
        come with us, and fight the children of Ammon, and thou shalt
      9 be our chief over all the inhabitants of Galaad.Then Jejmthae
        said to the elders of Galaad, If you take me back to fight the
        children of Ammon, and the Lord deliver them up before me,
     10 I shall be your chief? And the elders of Galaad said to him,
        Let the Lord be witness between us, if we do not according
     11 to this thy word. Thereupon Jephthae went with the elders of
        Galaad, and the people made hiin head and leader over them.
     12 And when Jephthae had repeated all these his terms before the
        Lord, at Massepha, he sent messengers to the king of the Am-
                                                                                                                                        ;
          Ch. XI.                                              JUDGES.
                raonites, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art
          13 come up against me to fight in my land ?                                            And the king of the
                Ammonites said to Jephthae's messengersâ€”Because Israel
                took my land when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon
                to Jabok, and to the Jordan.                               Now therefore restore me those
          14 lands peaceably, and I will depart.                                      Thereupon Jephthae again
                sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, and said to
          15 him, Thus saith Jephthae, Israel did not take the land of Moab,
          16 nor the land of the children of Amnion.                                             For when they came
                out of Egypt, Israel marched through the wilderness to the sea
          17 of Siph, and came to Kades ; and Israel sent messengers to the
                king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, march through
          18 thy land ; but the king of Edom did not consent.                                                         They sent
                also to the king of Moab ; but the king of Moab did not con-
                sent.        So after halting at Kades, Israel marched through the
                wilderness, and went round the land of Edom, and the land of
                Moab, and came eastward of Moab, and encamped on the
                bank of the Arnon, but did not enter the borders of Moab
          19 for Arnon was the boundary of Moab.                                              Then Israel sent mes-
                sengers to Seon, king of the Amoritesâ€”the king of Esebon,
          20 and said to him, Let us we pray thee pass through thy land
                to our place ; but Seon would not trust Israel to pass through
                along his border, but assembled all his people, and encamped
          21 at Jasa, and came to an engagement with Israel.                                                   And the Lord
                God of Israel delivered into the hands of Israel, Seon and all
          22 his people, and they smote him.                                       So Israel took possession of
                all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited the country from
          23 Arnon to Jabok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.                                                              Now
                therefore hath the Lord God of Israel removed the Amorites
          24 from before his people, and art thou to possess them ?                                                          If thy
                god Chamos were to put thee in possession of any places,
                wouldst thou not possess them ?                                  And shall not we succeed all
                those whom the Lord our God hath removed from before us ?
          25 Besides, art thou in any respect better than Balak, son of Sep-
          26 phor, king of Moab ?                            Did he ever contend with Israel, or go
                to war with them about this, all the while they lived in Ese-
                bon, and the borders thereof, and in the land of Aroer, and the
                borders thereof, and in all the cities along the Jordan, for three
                 hundred years?                   Why didst thou not in all this time recover
      Ch. XI.                   JUDGES.
     27 them.   Now therefore I call God to witness, that I have not
         sinned against thee, and that thou dealest wrongfully in going
         to war with me.  Let the Lord, who is Judge, judge this day
      28 between Israel and the Ammonites.  And when the king of the
         Ammonites hearkened not to the message which Jephthae
     29 sent him, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthae, and he
         marched through Galaad, and Manasses, and         passed the
         watch tower of Galaad, into the border of the children of Am-
         nion.
     30     And Jephthae vowed a vow to the Lord, and said, If thou
         deliver the children of Ammon into my hand, it shall be, that
     31 whosoever cometh from the door of my house to meet me,
         when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall be
         for the Lord.  Him will I dedicate as a whole burnt offering.
     32 And when Jephthae passed on to come to battle with the chil-
         dren of Ammon, the Lord delivered them into his hand, and
     33 he smote them from Aroer all the way to Arnon, through the
         number of twenty cities, and even to Ebelcharmin, with a pro-
     34 digious slaughter.   And when the children of Ammon were
         subdued before the children of Israel, and Jephthae came to
         Massepha, to his house, behold his daughter came out to meet
     35 him, with timbrels and choirs.   Now she was his only child.
         Besides her, he had neither son nor daughter.  And when he
         saw her he rent his clothes, and said, Alas ! Alas ! my daugh-
         ter ! Thou hast indeed troubled me ; and thou thyself mayst
         be in trouble with me, for I have opened my mouth to the
     36 Lord against thee, and I cannot go back.      Upon which she
         said to him, Hast thou, my father, opened thy mouth to the
         Lord ?  Do to me according to what hath proceeded out of thy
         mouth, since the Lord hath executed vengeance for thee on
      37 thine enemiesâ€”on the children of Ammon.     Then she said to
         her father, Grant me ; my father, I pray thee, this favour.Let
         me alone two months, and I will go up and down on the moun-
         tains, and bewail my virginityâ€”I call God to witness, with only
      38 my female attendants. And he said, Go. So he sent her away two
         months, and she went with her female attendants, and bewailed
      39 hervirgin state onthe mountains. And at the end of two months
         she returned to her father and he performed with her his vow,
      40 which he had vowed ; so she knew not a man.    And it was a
             XIII.            JUDGES.
    Ch. XII.
       custom in Israel, from year to year, for the daughters of Israel
       to go and bewail the daughter of Jephthae, the Galaadite, four
       days in the year.
    XII.    Now the Ephraimites assembled, and went northward,
       and said to Jephthae, Why didst thou go to fight the Am-
       monites, and not call on us to go with thee ?We will burn
       thy house over thee with fire. And Jephthae said to them,
       When I and my people, and the children of Ammon, were at
       hard conflict, I called on you ; but you did not save me out of
     3 their hands. So when I saw that thou wast not a deliverer, I
       put my life in my hand, and went against the Ammonites, and
       the Lord delivered them into my hand.   Why then are you
     4 come up this day to fight against me ? Then Jephthae re-as-
       sembled all the men of Galaad, and came to an engagement
       with Ephraim.  And the men of Galaad smote Ephraim.    Be-
       cause they of Ephraim who were saved, said, You Galaadites
     5 belong partly to Ephraim, and partly to Manasses, therefore
       the  Galaadites seized the passages of  the  Jordan before
       Ephraim ; and when those of Ephraim who escaped, said, Let
     6 us cross over ; the men of Galaad said to them, Art thou an
       Ephraimite ?  And when any said, No, then they said to him,
       say Stachys. And if he did not pronounce it distinctly, they took
       him, and slew him at the passages of the Jordan.So there fell
       of Ephraim, at that time, forty two thousand men.
     7    And Jephthae judged Israel six years.Then Jephthae the
     8 Galaadite died, and was buried in his own city, Galaad.And
     9 after him, Abaissan of Bethlehem, judged Israel.And he had
       thirty sons and thirty daughters.His daughters he sent abroad,
       and he brought from abroad thirty daughters for his sons, and
    10 he judged Israel seven years. And Abaissan died, and was
    11 buried in Bethlehem.  And after him Ailom, the Zabulonite,
    12 judged Israel ten years. And Ailom the Zabulonite died, and was
    13 buried in Ailom, in the land of Zabulon.And after him Abdon,
    14 son of Ellel, the Pharathonite, judged Israel.And he had forty
       sons, and thirty grand sons, who rode on seventy colts ; and
    15 he judged Israel eight years.Then Abdon, son of Ellel the
       Pharathonite, died, and was buried at Pharathon, in the land
       of Ephraim, on mount Amelek.
    XIII.    And the children of Israel again proceeded to do evil
       Ch. XIII.                  JUDGES.
          in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord delivered them into the
        2 hand of the Philistines, forty years.Now there was a man of
          Saraa, a community of the Danites, whose name was Manoe;
        3 and his wife was barren, and never had a child. And an angel
          of the Lord appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold,
        4 thou art barren and hast never had a child.   But thou shalt
          conceive a son.  Now therefore be careful not to drink wine,
          nor any fermented liquor, nor eat any thing which is unclean.
        5 For behold thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and on
          his head a razor shall not come ; for the child shall be a Na-
          zarite to God from the womb.   And he shall begin to save Is-
        6 rael out of the hand of the Philistines.And the woman went,
          and told her husband, saying, There came to me a man of
          God, and his visage was like that of an angel of God, very
          awful, so that I did not ask him whence he was, nor did he
          tell me his name.  But he said to me, Behold thou art with
        7 child, and shalt bear a son.Now therefore thou must not drink
          wine nor any fermented liquor, nor eat any thing unclean ;
          for the child shall be consecrated to God, from the womb to
       8 the day of his death.  Whereupon Manoe prayed to the Lord,
          and said,    Lord Adonaie ! grant me that the man of God,
          whom thou didst send, may come to us again, and instruct us
        9 what we shall do to the child which is to be born.  And God
          hearkened to the voice of Manoe, and the angel of God came
          again to the woman.    Now she was sitting in the field, and
      10 Manoe her husband was not with her.     So the woman hasted,
          and ran and told her husband, and said to him, The man hath
      11 appeared to me, who came to me before.     Upon which Manoe
          arose, and went with his wife, and when he came to the man,
          he said to him, Art thou the man who spoke to my wife ?  And
      12 the angel said, I am.   Then Manoe said, Now the thing will
          come to pass.   How is the child to be educated, and what
      13 is he to do?   And the angel of the Lord said to Manoe, He
          must abstain from all the things which I mentioned to this
      14 woman.    He must eat nothing which proceedeth from the vine,
          nor drink wine, nor any fermented liquor, nor eat any thing
      15 which is unclean.  He must observe all that I have commanded
          her. Then Manoe said to the angel of the Lord, Let us de-
      16 tain thee here till we set before thee a kid of the goats.And
     Ch. XIV.                        JUDGES.
         the angel of the Lord said to Manoe, Though thou detain me
         I cannot eat of thy victuals ; but if thou wouldst offer a whole
     17 burnt offering, offer it to the Lord.       Because Manoe did not
     18 know that he was an angel of the Lord, therefore Manoe said
         to him, What is thy name, that when thy word cometh to pass
         we may honour thee ?      And the angel of the Lord said to Ma-
     19 noe, Why askest thou my name?              It is indeed Wonderful.
         Then Manoe took the kid of the goats, with the sacrifice of
         Hour, and carried them up upon the rock for the Lord.             And
         he went apart to offer the sacrifice, while Manoe and his wife
     20 were looking on.     And when the flame ascended above the altar,
         up towards heaven, the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame.
     21 When Manoe and his wife saw this, they fell flat with their
     22 face to the ground.     And as the angel of the Lord no more ap-
         peared to Manoe and his wife, Manoe then knew that he was
         an angel of the Lord ; whereupon he said to his wife, We shall
     23 surely die, for we have seen God.        But his wife said to him,
         Had it been the will of the Lord to cause us to die, he would
         not have received at our hand a whole burnt offering, and a sa-
         crifice ; nor would he have shewed us all these things ; nor would
         he, as on this occasion, have caused us to hear these things.
     24      So the woman bore a son, and called his name Sampson ;
     25 and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him ; and the Spirit
         of the Lord began to go out with him, at the camp of Dan,
         between Saraa and Esthaol.
     XIV.       And Sampson went down to Thamnatha, and saw at
      2 Thamnatha a woman of the daughters of the Philistines, and
         he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have
         seen a woman at Thamnatha, of the daughters of the Philis-
      3 tines.   Now therefore get her for me for a wife.         And his fa-
         ther and his mother said to him, Are there not daughters of thy
         brethren, or a woman among my whole tribe, that thou shouldst
         go to take a wife from among the uncircumcisecl Philistines?
         ButSampson said to his father, Get this woman for me ; for she is
      4 right in my eyes.     His father and his mother did not know that
         it was of the Lord, that he was seeking to take vengeance on
      5 the Philistines.    Now at that time the Philistines had dominion
         over Israel.   Then Sampson went down, with his father and
         his mother to Thamnatha, and when he came to the vineyard
                                                                                                                             :
           Cb. XIV.                                         JUDGES.
             6 of Thamiiatka, behold, a young roaring lion met bim ; and the
                 Spirit of tbe Lord came upon bim, and be crushed bim as one
                 would a kid ; though he bad nothing in his hands.                                          But he did
             7 not tell his father or his mother what he had done.                                               So they
                 went down, and spoke to the woman, and the matter was sett-
             8 led to Sampson's satisfaction.                          And when he returned, the year
                after, to take his wife, he turned aside to see the carcase of
                the lion, and behold there was a swarm of bees, and honey in
             9 the lion's mouth.                   So he took out some of the combs in his
                hand, and went on eating; and when he came to his father and
                his mother, he gave them, and they ate thereof.                                           But he did
                not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the lion's
          10 mouth.             And when his father went down to the woman, Samp-
                son made an entertainment there seven days ; for so young men
          11 usually do.                Now when they saw him, they made choice of
          12 thirty men to be with him.                                And Sampson said to them, I
                will propound to you a riddle ; if you explain it during the
                seven days of the entertainment, or find out the meaning of
                it, I will give you thirty Sindons, and thirty suits of apparel
          13 but if you cannot tell me, you shall give me thirty Sindons
                and thirty changes of apparel.                            And they said, Propound thy
          14 riddle that we may hear it.                         Then he said to them, What eatable
                came from the eater ; and, from the fierce, what that is sweet ?
          15 And when in the course of three days they could not explain
               the riddle, they on the fourth day said to Sampson's wife, Ask
               we pray thee thy husband, and get him to explain the riddle to
         16 thee, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire.                                               Have
               you invited us to do us an injury?                                  So Sampson's wife wept
               before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and hast not
               loved me ; for thou hast not told me the riddle which thou hast
               propounded to the children of my people.                                     And Sampson said
               to her, If I have not told it to my father and my mother, should
         17 I tell thee?               But as she continued to weep before him, during
               the seven days, while the feast lasted, he at length on the se-
               venth clay told her, because she importuned him ; and she told
         18 the children of her people.                         So the men of the city said to him
               on the seventh day, before the sun was set, What is sweeter
               than honey, and what fiercer than a lion ?                                   Upon which Samp-
               son said to them, If you had not ploughed with my heifer, you
      Ch. XV.                                          JUDGES.
       11Â»   would not have known my riddle.                            Then the Spirit of the Lord
            came upon                                                     T
                                  him, and he went down to Ascalon, and slew of
            them thirty men, and took their garments, and gave the suits
             to them who had expounded the riddle.                                       And Sampson was
       20 rilled with wrath, and went up to his father's house, and Samp-
            son's wife was married to one of those friends of his, with
            whom he had contracted friendship.
       XV.            The next year, however, in the days of the wheat harvest,
            Sampson visited his wife with a kid of the goats, and said, Let
            me go in, to my wife, into the chamber ; but her father would
        2 not suffer him to go in.                      And her father said, I thought that thou
            didst utterly hate her, therefore I gave her to one of thy friends.
        3 But is not her younger sister better than she ?                                          Let this one,
            I pray thee, be thine, instead of her.                             Thereupon Sampson said
            to them, Now, at least for once, I must be justified by the
         4 Philistines in doing them an injury.                                Then Sampson went and
            caught three hundred foxes, and he took torches ; and when
            he had turned tail to tail, he put a torch between every two
         5 tails, and tied them, and set fire to the torches, and let them go
             through the standing corn of the Philistines.                                   And they burned
             both what was on the threshing floors, and the standing corn,
         G and also the vineyards, and the olive trees.                                       Whereupon the
            Philistines said, Who hath done this?                                    And when they were
            told that it was Sampson, the son in law of Thamni, because
             he had taken his wife, and given her to one of his friends, the
            Philistines went up and burned her, and her father's house,
         7 with fire.          And Sampson said to them, As you have served her,
         8 so I will take vengeance on you, and then 1 will be at rest.                                              So
             he smote them in combat with a great slaughter, and went
         9 down and dwelt in a hollow of the rock Etam.                                          Then the Phi-
             listines      went up, and encamped in Juda, and spread them-
       10 selves through Lechi.                       And the chief of Juda said, Why are
             you come up against us?                           And the Philistines said, We are
             come up to bind Sampson, and to do to him as he hath done
       11 to us.          Upon this three thousand men of Juda went down to
             the hollow of the rock Etam, and said to Sampson, Dost thou
             not know that the Philistines have dominion over us?                                                Why
             then hast thou done this to us ?                            And Sampson said, As they
       12 did to me, so have I done to them.                                    Then they said to him,
                   vol. t.                                       3 I
                                                                                                                            ;
         Ch. XVI.                                          JUDGES.
               We are come down to bind thee, and deliver thee into the
               hands of the Philistines.                       And Sampson said to them, Swear
         13 to me.            Perhaps yon yourselves will fall upon me.                                     And they
               said to him, No ; we will only bind thee fast, and deliver thee in-
               to their hands ; but we will not put thee to death. So they bound
               him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
         14 And when they came to Jaw hone, the Philistines shouted, and
               ran to meet him.                And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him ;
               and the cords which were on his arms became like tow, which
               is   burned with fire ; and the bands dropped from his hands,
               and he found the jaw bone of an ass lying there ; so he stretch-
               ed forth his hand, and took it up, and with it smote a thousand
         16 men.           And Sampson said, With the jaw of an ass I have utterly
               routed them ; for with the jaw of an ass I have slain a thousand
          17 men.          And when he had done speaking, he threw the jaw out of
         18 his hand, and called that place, Slaughter of the jaw.                                             And be-
               ing very thirsty he wept before the Lord and said, Thou hast
               vouchsafed this great deliverance to the hand of thy servant
               but now I must die of thirst, and fall into the hands of the un-
         19 circumcised.                 Whereupon God caused that pool at Jaw to
               break forth, and water flowed out of it, and he drank, and his
               spirit returned, and he revived.                            For this cause the name of
               that fountain which is at Jaw is now called, The fountain of
               the invoked.
         20            Now when he had judged Israel in the days of the Philis-
         XVI.             tines twenty years, Sampson went to Gaza, and saw there
           2 a womanâ€”a harlot, and went in to her.                                    And when the Gazites
               were told that Sampson was come there, they surrounded him,
               and lay in wait for him the whole night, at the gate of the city.
               They indeed kept quiet all the night, saying, When the dawn
           3 appeareth we shall kill him.                         But when Sampson had lain till
               midnight, he arose in the middle of the night, and took the
               doors of the city gate with the two posts, and lifted them up
               with the bar, and laid them on his shoulders, and went up to the
               top of the mountain which looked towards Chebron, and de-
               posited them there.
           4         And after this he loved a woman at Alsorach, whose name
           5 was Dalida ; and the chiefs of the Philistines went up to her
               and said to her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength
    Ch. XVI.                       JUDGES.
        lieth, and how we may prevail over him, and bind him so as
        to humble him ; and we will give thee, every one of us eleven
      6 hundred pieces of silver.    Upon this Dalida said to Sampson,
        Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and with
      7 what thou couldst be bound so as to be humbled.        And Samp-
        son said to her, Were they to bind me with seven thongs, wet,
        but not rotten, I should lose my strength, and be as other men.
      8 So the chiefs of the Philistines brought her seven thongs, wet,
      9 but not rotten, and she bound him with them.         Now she had
        men lying in wait in her chamber.      Then she said to him, The
        Philistines are upon thee, Sampson.     Upon which he broke the
        thongs, as one would break a thread of tow, when it is touched
    10 with fire.   So his strength was not known.       Then Dalida said
        to Sampson, Behold, thou hast deceived me and told me lies.
     11 Now therefore tell me with what thou canst be bound.           And
        he said to her, Were they to bind me with new ropes which
        have never been used, I should lose my strength, and be like
     12 other men.    So Dalida took new ropes, and bound him with
        them, and the men in ambush came out of the chamber and
        she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Sampson !          Where-
     13 upon he broke them from his arms like a thread.       Then Dalida
        said to Sampson, Behold, thou hast deceived me and told me
        lies.  Tell me, I pray thee, with what thou canst be bound.
        And he said to her, If thou wert to weave these seven locks
        of my head with the woof, and fasten them into the wall with
     14 that pin, I should be as weak as other men.       So when he went
        to sleep, Dalida took the seven locks of his head, and wove
        them with the woof, and fastened them with the pin to the wall,
         and said, The Philistines are upon thee Sampson !          Where-
         upon he roused from his sleep, and pulled the pin of the web
     15 out of the wall.    Then Dalida said to Sampson, How canst
         thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me ?       These
         three times thou hast deceived me, and hast not told me where-
     10 in thy great strength lieth.   And as she continued to aftiict him
         daily with her speeches, and press him, and tired him even to
         death, he at length told her all his heart, and said to her ; There
         hath never come a razor on my head, because I am consecrat-
     17 ed to God from my mother's womb.           If therefore I were sha-
         ven, my strength would depart from me, and I would become
     Cb. XVI.                     JUDGES.
     18 weak, and be like all otber men.     When Dalida saw that be
         bad told ber all bis heart, sbe sent for tbe cbiefs of tbe Philis-
         tines, and said, Come up tbis once more, for be batb told me
         all bis beart.So tbe cbiefs of tbe Pbilistines went up to ber,
     19 and carried tbe money in their bands.    And when Dalida bad
         lulled Sampson to sleep on ber knees, sbe sent for a man, and
         be sbaved off tbe seven locks of bis bead, and began to bum-
     20 ble bim ; for bis strength was gone from him.     And when Da-
         lida said, Tbe Philistines are upon thee Sampson !   He awoke
         from his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times hereto-
         fore, and rouse myself. He indeed did not know that the Lord
     21 had departed from him.     Then the Philistines seized him and
         put out his eyes, and carried him down to Gaza, and bound
         him with fetters of brass, and he was kept grinding in the pri-
         son house.
     22     Now when tbe hairs of bis head began to grow as when he
         was shaven, the chiefs of tbe Philistines assembled to offer a
      23 great sacrifice to their god Dagon, and to rejoice.  And they
         said ; God hath delivered Sampson, our great enemy into our
      24 hand.   And when the people saw him, they sung praises to
         their god, saying, Our god hath delivered our enemy into our
         handsâ€”him who wasted our land, and multiplied tbe number
      25 of our slain. Now when their heart was elated with joy, they
         said, Call Sampson from the prison, and let bim make sport
         for us ; so they called Sampson from the prison, and be made
         sport for them ; and when they bad beaten him with rods, they
      26 set him between tbe pillars.  Then Sampson said to tbe young-
         man who had hold of bis band, Let go, that I may feel tbe pil-
      27 lars on which the house restetb, and lean upon them.       Now
         the house was full of men and women ; and all the chiefs of
         the Pbilistines were there ; and on the top of the house there
         were about three thousand men and women looking at Samp-
      28 son's sports. Then Sampson wept before tbe Lord, and said,
           Adonaie, Lord, remember me, I beseech thee, and strength-
         en me yet this once more,      my God, that I may take ven-
      29 geance on the Philistines for my two eyes.      Then Sampson
         took bold of tbe two pillars, on which the bouse rested, and
         by which it was supported.    And having taken hold of one
     30 with bis right band, and of the other with his left, be said, Let
         me die with the Philistines, and strained with all bis might,
        XVII.                     JUDGES.
    Ch.
       and the house fell upon the chiefs and on all the people in it.
       So that those whom Sampson slew at his death were more
    31 than those whom he had slain during his life.         And his bre-
       thren, and the house of his father, went down, and took him, and
       came up and buried him between Saraa and Esthaol in the tomb
       of his father Manoe.   Now he had judged Israel twenty years.
           The Idolatry of the house of Micah and of the Danites.
    XVII.       There was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was
       Micah; and he said to his mother, With regard to the eleven
       hundred pieces of silver which thou hadst taken for thyself,
       and for which thou didst lay me under a curse, and speak in
       myhearing, behold the money is in my possession.         I took it.
     3 And his mother said, Blessed of the Lord is my son.            And
        when he gave his mother the eleven hundred pieces of silver,
       his mother said, I indeed had dedicated this money to the
       Lord, out of my hand, for my son to make a graven and a
     4 molten image.    Now therefore I will give it to thee.    So when
       he gave his mother the money, she took two hundred pieces
        of silver, and gave them to a silver smith, and of it he made
        a graven and a molten image, and it was in the house of Mi-
     5 cah.   So the house of Micah was to him the house of a god.
        And he made an ephod and theraphin, and consecrated one of
     6 his sons, and he became his priest.      Now in those days there
        was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in
     7 his own eyes.    And there was a young man of Bethlehem, a
        community of Juda, but he was a Levite and a sojourner there.
     8 And this man went from Bethlehem, the city of Juda, to so-
        journ wherever he could find a place, and came to mount
        Ephraim to the house of Micah, with a view to proceed on in
     9 his journey.   And Micah said to him, Whence comest thou ? and
        he in reply, said, I am a Levite of Bethlehem Juda, and I am
    10 going to sojourn wherever I can find a place.           Whereupon
        Micah said to him, Abide with me, and be to me a father and
        a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver a year, and a
    11 suit of clothes, and thy victuals.     So the Levite went in and
        began his abode witli the man ; and he treated the youth as
    12 one of his sons.   And when Micah had consecrated the Levite,
        and lie became his priest, and was in Micah's house, Micah
        said, Now 1 know that the Lord will do me good, because I
        have got a Levite for a priest.
       Ch. XVIII.                      JUDGES.
       XVIII.        In those days there was no king in Israel ; and in those
           days the tribe of Dan was seeking to take possession of a lot of
           inheritance for themselves ; for even till that day they had not got
           possession of the inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.
        2 So the children of Dan sent from their communities five men
           of valour, from Saraa, and from Esthaol, to view the land and
           examine it thoroughly, and said to them, Go and examine the
           land thoroughly.     And they went to Mount Ephraim, to the
        3 house of Micah.      And when they lodged there, at the house of
           Micah, they perceived the voice of the young Levite, and turn-
           ed aside there and said to him, Who brought thee here? and
        4 what art thou doing at this place ? what business hast thou here ?
           And he said to them, Thus and thus hath Micah done to me,
        5 and hired me, and I am become his priest.          Then they said to
           him, Inquire, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether
           the journey in which we are engaged will be prosperous. And the
        6 priest said to them, Go in peace.       This journey of yours which
        7 you are going is before the Lord.         So the five men proceeded
           on and came to Laisa, and saw the people there dwelling se-
           curely.   Their manner of living was tranquil like that of the
           Sidonians.   There was none to reproveâ€”none in the land to
           put them to shame for any thing.        Possessing wealth they were
           spending it luxuriously ; and they were at a great distance from
        8 the Sidonians, and had no intercourse with any man.             So the
           five men came to their brethren at Saraa, and Esthaol, and said
        9 to them, Why sit ye here ?       Moreover they said, Arise and let
           us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold
           it is very good, but still you continue quiet.       You should not
       10 delay any longer to go and take possession of that land.           And
           when you go, you will come upon a j)eople living in security,
           though it is a large country ; for God hath delivered it into your
           hands.   It is a place where there is no want of any thing on
       11 earth.    Then there went up thence, of the communities of
           Dan, from Saraa and Esthaol, six hundred men well equipt
       12 with all necessaries of war.       And in going up they encamp-
           ed at Kariathiarim in Juda, for which cause that place is
           called The Gamp of Ban to this day.         Behold it is behind Ka-
       13 riathiarim.    And from that place they passed through mount
       14 Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.                And the five
   Ch. XVIII.                  JUDGES.
       men who had gone to spy the land of Laisa, addressing
       their brethren, said, Yon know that at this house there is an
       ephod ,and a theraphin, and a graven and a molten image ;
    15 now consider therefore what you are to do.   Upon this they
       turned aside, and went to the house of the young Levite, to the
   16 house of Micah, and saluted him.  While the six hundred Da-
       nites, who were equipt with implements of war, stood at the
       gate of the city, the five men, who had gone to spy the land,
   18 went up and entered the house of Micah, while the priest was
       standing there, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and
   19 the theraphin, and the molten image.  And when the priest said
       to them, What are you doing ? they said to him, Hold thy
       peace, Put thy hand on thy mouth and come with us, and be
       to us a father and a priest.Is it better for thee to be the priest
       of the house of one man, than to be the priest of a tribe, and
      of the house of a community of Israel ? And the priest's heart
   20 was delighted.  So he took the ephod, and the theraphin, and
      the graven, and the molten image, and went into the midst of
   21 the people.  And they turned and went away, and sent the chil-
   22 dren, and the cattle, and the heavy baggage before them. And
      when they were at a considerable distance from the house of
      Micah, behold Micah and the men, the families adjacent to
      Micah's house, uttered the shout of war and overtook the Dan-
   23 ites. Upon which the sons of Dan turned about and said to
      Micah, What is the matter with thee that thou hast raised the
   24 shout of war ?  And Micah said, Because you have taken my
      graven image, which I made, and the priest ; and have gone
      away.   AVhat more could have happened to me ?   Why then do
   25 you say to me, Why dost thou shout ?   And the sons ofDan said
      to him, Let not thy voice be heard among us.     Should warm
      spirited men come to an engagement with us they will endan-
   26 ger thy life, and the life of thy household. Then the sons of
      Dan proceeded on in their march.   And when Micah saw that
   27 they were too strong for him, he returned to his house.So the
      sons of Dan took what Micah had made, and the priest who
      was with him, and went to Laisa, to a people living at ease,
      and in a state of security, and smote them with the edge of the
   28 sword, and burned the city with fire.There was none to deliver
      them, for thev were far from the Sidonians, and had no inter-
                                                                                                                   ;

                course with any man.                 It is situate in the valley of the house of
          29 Kaab. And they rebuilt the city, and dwelt therein, and called the
                name of the city Ban alter the name of their father Dan who
                was born to Israel.               Now the name of that city formerly was
          30 Oulamais.            And the children of Dan set up for themselves the
                graven image, and Jonathan, a Gersonite, son of Manasses, he
                and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites, even to
          31 the day of the capture of the Ark.                               They indeed set up for
                themselves the graven image which Micah made, all the time
                the house of God was at Selom.
                                  The war with the tribe of Benjamin.
          XIX.          In those days when there was no king in Israel, there was a
                certain Levite who dwelt on the side of mount Ephraim, and
            2 he took him a concubine from Bethlehem Juda, and she went
            3 away from him to her father's house at Bethlehem Juda.                                          And
               when she had been there four months, her husband arose and
                went after her, with an intent to speak affectionately to her,
                and bring her back to him.                      And he had a young man with
                him, and a couple of asses.                    And when she introduced him to
                her father's house, and the young woman's father saw him, he
            4 was rejoiced to meet him.                      And his father in law, the young
               woman's father, detained him, and he abode with him three
            5 days, and they eat, and drank, and lodged there.                                    And on the
               fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, and he got up
               to depart, the father of the young woman said to his son in
               law, Comfort thy heart with a morsel of bread, and after that
           6 you shall go.              So they two sat down, and eat and drank to-
               gether, and the father of the young woman said to the man,
               Come I pray thee, stay all night and let thy heart be merry.
            7 And when the man arose to depart, his father in law pressed
            8 him ; so he sat down, and staid there that night.                                         And he
               arose early in the morning of the fifth day with a view to depart
               but the father of the young woman said, Comfort thy heart, I
            9 pray thee ; and then travel on till the close of the day.                                      And
               when they two had eaten, and the man arose to depart, with his
               concubine and his servant, his father in lawâ€”the young wo-
               man's father said to him, Behold the day is spent till near af-
               ternoon, lodge here to-night, and let thy heart be merry, and set
               out on your journey early in the morning, and thou wilt reach

    10 thy home.   But the man would not consent to stay all night,
       but arose and departed, and came over against Jebus that is Je-
    ll rusalem.  Now he had with him a couple of asses, saddled, for
       himself and his concubine. And when they came to Jebus the
       day was far spent, so the servant said to his master, Come, I
       pray thee, and let us turn in to this city of the Jebusites, and
    12 lodge there ; But his master said, We will not turn aside to a
       strange city, in which there is none of the children of Israel, but
    13 go on to Gabaa. Then he said to his servant, Come let us draw
       near to one of those places, that we may lodge either in Gabaa,
    14 or in Kama.  So they passed on, and proceeded in their jour-
       ney, and the sun set upon them when they were near Gabaa,
    15 which is in Benjamin.  Whereupon they turned aside thither,
       to go and lodge in Gabaa, and they went in, and sat down in
       the street of the city ; but there was not a man who invited them
    16 to lodge at his house.And behold there came an old man from
       his work, out of the field, late in the evening.Xow the man
       was from mount Ephraim, and sojourned at Gabaa, but the
    17 men of the place were Benjaminites. And when he raised his
       eyes, and saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city, the
       old man said, Whither art thou going, and whence comest
    18 thou?  And he said to him, We are on our way from Bethle-
       hem of Juda to the side of mount Ephraim. I am of that place.
       I went to Bethlehem Juda, and am on my way home, but there
   19 is not a man who inviteth me to his house.I have indeed straw
       and provender for our asses, and bread and wine for myself
       and the handmaid, and the young man with thy servants.
   20 There is no want of any thing.  Thereupon the old man said,
      Peace be to thee. But let all thy wants be upon me.But thou
      must not lodge in the street.So he took him to his house, and
      provided a place for the asses. And when they had washed
   22 their feet, they ate and drank. But while they were cheering
      their hearts, behold the men of the cityâ€”sons of transgressors,
      surrounded the house, and knocked at the door, and spake to
      the man, the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring
      out the man who came to thy house that we may know him.
   23 Upon this the man, the master of the house, went out to them
      and said, Do not, my brethren ; do not, I pray you, the man an
      injury after his entering my house.You must not commit such
         vol. I.                  3 K

      24 folly. Behold here is my daughter, a virgin, and his concubine ;
         I will bring them out, and you may humble them and do to
         them what seemeth good in your eyes, but to the man you
      25 must not do such an act of folly.But the men would not heark-
         en to him.  Then the man took his concubine, and brought her
         out to them, and they knew her, and abused her the whole
         night till the morning.  And soon as the day began to dawn
      26 they let her go. And the woman went at the dawn of day and
         threw herself down at the door of the house where her husband
      27 was, until it should be light.And when her husband arose in
         the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out
         with a design to proceed on in his journey, behold the woman,
         his concubine, was lying at the doors of the house with her
      28 hands on the threshold.  And he said to her, Arise and let us
         depart.  But she made no answer ; for she was dead.So he took
         her up, upon the ass, and went to his place, and took a knife,
      29 and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her into twelve
      30 pieces, and sent them through all the borders ofIsrael.Where-
         upon every one who saw them said, There never was such a
         thing done or seen from the day the children of Israel came out
         of Egypt to this day.  Appoint for yourselves a counsel over
      XX.      her and speak.  So all the children of Israel set out, and
         the congregation assembled as one man from Dan to Bersabee,
         and from the land of Galaad, before the Lord at Massepha.
       2 And when all the tribes of Israel were drawn up before the
         Lord in the congregation of the people of God, there were four
       3 hundred thousand footmen who drew the sword.        Now the
         children of Benjamin heard that the Israelites were gone up to
          Massepha.  Then the children of Israel who had come together
       4 said, Speak.  Where was this wickedness done.     Whereupon
          the man, the Levite, the husband of the woman who was slain,
          answered and said, I came to Gabaa of Benjamin, I and my
       5 concubine, to lodge.  And the men of Gabaa rose upon me,
          and beset me and the house by night.    Me they would have
       6 killed, and my concubine they forced so that she died.  Upon
          which I took my concubine, and divided her in pieces and sent
       7 them through all the borders ofthe inheritance of the children of
          Israel. Since they have occasioned a ferment and destruction in
          Israel, behold you are all Israelites ; Advise and consult here for
        Ch. XX.                                                JUDGES.
          8 yourselves.                Then all the people arose as one man, and said, We
           9 will not, any ofus go to his habitation, nor shall any of us return to
               his house            and this is what shall be done to G-abaa ; we will go up
                                 ;
         10 against it by lot. But let us take ten men for the hundreds through
               all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred for the thousands and a
              thousand for the ten thousands to collect provisions, and bring
              themto G-abaa ofBenjamin, that we may do to it according to the
        11 abominable act which it hath committed in Israel.                                                        And when
        12 all Israel was united against that city, as one man, the tribes of
              Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What
        13 wickedness is this which is done among you ? Now therefore de-
               liver up those men, those sons of transgressors in Gabaa, that
               we may put them to death, and purge away evil from Israel. But
               the children of Benjamin would not hearken to their brethren
        14 the children of Israel.                         Nay the children of Benjamin assembled
               fromtheir cities to Gabaa, to go out to battle against the children
        15 of Israel.               And the children of Benjamin, who came from their
               cities, were at that time reviewed, twenty three thousand men
               who drew the sword, exclusive of the inhabitants of Gabaa,
        16 who were also reviewed.                                 Out of all the people seven hun-
               dred were selected, who used both hands alike.                                                        All these
               were men who could sling stones to a hair breadth, and not
         17 miss.           Now the men of Israel had been reviewed, exclusive of
               Benjamin, four hundred thousand men, who drew the sword.
         18 All these were men of array.                                  And they arose, and went up to
               Baithel, and inquired of God.                               And the children of Israel said,
               Who shall go up as our commander in chief to battle against the
               children of Benjamin ?                         And the Lord said Juda shall go up as
         19 commanderin chief.                          And all the children of Israel arose in the
         20 morning, and encamped against Gabaa ; and all Israel went
               out to battle against Benjamin, and drew up for them before
         21 Gabaa.              And the children of Benjamin sallied from Gabaa, and
               destroyed of Israel that day on the field of battle twenty two
         22 thousand men.                     But the men of Israel took courage, and proceed-
               ed again to set the battle in array in the same place where they
         23 had drawn up the first day.                                    The sons of Israel had indeed
               gone up, and wept before the Lord till evening, and inquired
               of the Lord saying, Shall we again proceed to draw near to
               battle against the children of Benjamin our brethren 9                                                   And the
      Ch. XX.                    JUDGES.
      24 Lord said, Go up against them.   So the children of Israel ad-
      25 vanced against the children of Benjamin the second day.  And
         the children of Benjamin came out from Gabaa to meet them
         on the second day, and destroyed of Israel again on the field
         of battle, eighteen thousand men.    All these were men who
      26 drew the sword.   Upon this all the children of Israel, even the
         whole people went up and came to Baithel, and wept, and sat
         there before the Lord, and fasted the whole day till evening,
         and offered whole burnt offerings and sacrifices before the
      27 Lord.  For in those days the ark of the covenant of the Lord
         their God was there, and Phineas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron,
      28 stood before it in those days.And the children of Israel inquir-
         ed of the Lord saying, Shall we proceed again to go out to bat-
         tle against the children ofBenjamin our brethren ? And the Lord
      29 said, Go up.  To-morrow I will deliver them into your hands.
         Then the children of Israel set men in ambush all around Ga-
      30 baa.  And the children of Israel went up against the children
         of Benjamin, the third day, and drew up in array before Gabaa
      31 as they had done once and again.   And the children of Benja-
         min sallied out to meet the people, and were drawn clean out
         of the city, and began to smite some of the people dead, as in
         the first and second engagement in the high ways, which lead
         up, one to Baithel, and the other to Gabaa, through the fields,
      32 about thirty men of Israel. And the children of Benjamin said,
         They fall before us, as heretofore.Now the sons of Israel had
         said, Let us flee, and draw them clean out of the city into the
      33 high ways.   And when they had done so, and every man arose
         from his place, then they drew up in array at Baal-thamar, and
      34 the ambush of Israel came up from their place, from Maraa-
         gabo, and there came over against Gabaa ten thousand men,
         chosen out of all Israel ; and the battle was fierce, for they did
      35 not know that evil was coming upon them.       And the Lord
         smote Benjamin before the children of Israel.   And the chil-
         dren of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty five thou-
      36 sand one hundred men.      All these drew the sworcl.   When
          the children of Benjamin saw that they were smittenâ€”now
         the Israelites had given way to Benjamin because they trusted
      37 to the ambush which they had laid for Gabaa ; but when they
         retreated, the ambush was put in motion, and rushed forward
                                     JUDGES.
     Ch. XXI.
        against Gabaa, and poured into it, and smote the city with the
    38 edge of the sword.       The children of Israel indeed had settled a
        signal of battle with the ambush, and that they should raise a coun-
    39 ter signal of smoke from the city.         So when the sons of Israel
        saw that the men in ambush had taken Gabaa, they halted, in
        order of battle.   Now Benjamin had begun to smite dead of the
        men of Israel about thirty men, for they said, They fall again
    40 before us, as in the former engagement.          But when the counter
        sign ascended over the city, higher and higher, like a pillar of
        smoke, Benjamin looked back, and behold, the destruction of
    41 the city ascended up to heaven.          So when Israel faced about,
    42 the men of Benjamin were struck with consternation, for they
        saw that evil was coming upon them, and they looked about
        before the children of Israel, towards the way of the wilder-
        ness, and fled.    But the battle overtook them.        And they sur-
    43 rounded and destroyed them who came from the cities.                They
        cut down Benjamin and pursued them closely from Nua to
    44 over against Gabaa, towards the rising of the sun, and there
        fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men.            All these were men
    45 of valour.     Now the rest of them had looked about, and fled
        towards the wilderness to the rock of Kemmon ; but of them
        the children of Israel gleaned up five thousand men.           And the
        children of Israel went down after them to Gedan, and smote
    46 of them two thousand men.          So that all who fell of Benjamin
        were twenty ^.Ye thousand men who that day drew the sword.
    47 All these were men of valour.          And the remainder, being six
        hundred men, turned and fled to the wilderness, to the rock of
     48 Remmon, and abode at Rock Remmon four months.                       And
         the children of Israel turned back upon the Benjaminites, and
         smote them with the edge of the sword, beginning at the city
         Methla, including cattle and every thing throughout all the
         cities.  And the cities which they came to, they burned with
         fire.
     XXI.       Now the children of Israel had sworn at Massepha, say-
         ing, Not a man of us shall give his daughter to a Benjaminite
      2 to wife.   So when the people came to Baithel they sat there till
         evening before God, then raising their voice, they wept bitterly
      3 and said, Why         Lord God of Israel hath this happened that
      4 there should be this day one tribe cut off from Israel?          And on
      Ch. XXT.                     JUDGES.
          the day following the people arose early in the morning, and
          built there an altar, and offered whole burnt offerings and sacri-
        5 flees. Then the children of Israel said, Who is there among
          all the tribes of Israel who came not up before the Lord at the
          general assembly?    For they had denounced the great curse
          against those who came not up before the Lord to Massepha,
        6 saying, Let him assuredly be put to death.    Now the children
          of Israel had felt compassion for Benjamin their brother, and
        7 said, There is now one tribe cut off from Israel, What shall we
          do for wives for the few who are left, seeing we have sworn
          by the Lord, that we will not give them any of our daughters
        8 for wives ?  So when they said, Who is there among the tribes
          of Israel who came not up before the Lord to Massepha ? and
          behold not a man had come to the camp from Jabis Galaad to
        9 the general assembly, and the people were reviewed, and there
       10 was not a man of the inhabitants of Jabis Galaad ; the congre-
          gation sent thither twelve thousand men from among the young
          warriors, and gave them a charge saying, Go and smite the in-
       11 habitants of Jabis Galaad with the edge of the sword : And this
          you shall do, You shall devote to destruction every male, and
          every woman who hath cohabited with man : but the virgins
       12 you shall preserve alive. Andhavingdoneso they found among
          the inhabitants four hundred young virgins who had not coha-
          bited with man, and brought them to the camp of Selom which
       13 is in the land of Chanaan.  Then all the congregation sent, and
          spoke to the children of Benjamin at Kock Kemmon, and in-
       14 vited them to peace.   And when Benjamin returned to the chil-
          dren of Israel at that time, the Israelites gave them the women
          whom they had saved alive from among the daughters of Jabis
       15 Galaad.   So they were pleased, and the people relented for Ben-
          jamin, because the Lord had made a breach among the tribes
       16 of Israel. Then the elders of the congregation said, What shall
          we do for wives for the rest ?  For all the women of Benjamin
       17 are destroyed : (Now they had determined that the inheritance
          of the Benjaminites should belong to them who had escaped,
       18 that a tribe might not be blotted out from Israel :) for we can-
          not give them any of our daughters for wives ; for we have
           sworn among the children of Israel, saying, Cursed be the man
       19 who giveth a wife to a Benjaminite.     Then they said, Behold
    Ch. XXI.                       JUDGES.
        there is a festival of the Lord at Selom, which is kept yearly,
        on the north of Baithel, towards the rising of the sun, on the
        high way which goeth up from Baithel to Sychem, and on the
    20 south of Lebona.      So they gave a charge to the Benjaminites
    21 saying, Go and lie in wait among the vineyards, and watch,
        and behold when the daughters of the inhabitants of Selom go
        out to dance in choirs, start out from the vineyards, and seize
        for yourselves every man a wife from among the daughters of
    22 Selom, and go to the land of Benjamin.          And when their fa-
        thers or their brothers come to us, to enter a complaint before
        us, we will say to them, Grant them as a favour to us, because
    23 we did not take every man a woman at the battle.          Seeing you
        have not given them, you have, as it were, accidentally trans-
        gressed.   And the children of Benjamin did so.         And having
        taken wives according to their number from among the choirs
        whom they surprised, they went, and returned to their iuhe-
    24 ritance, and rebuilt their cities and dwelt therein.    And the chil-
        dren of Israel went at that time every man to his tribe, and to
        his kindred, and went out thence every man to his possession.
    25 And in those days, there being mo king in Israel, every man
        did what was right in his own eyes.
                                     KUTH.
    I.     Now when the Judges ruled, there was a famine in the land,
        and a man went from Bethlehem Juda to sojourn in the coun-
      2 try of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.           The man's
        name was Elimelech, and his wife's name was Noemin, and the
        namesofhis twosons, Maalon and Chelaion.        They were Ephrath-
      3 ites of Bethlehem Juda.      They went to the country of Moab,
        and while they were there, Elimelech, the husband of Noemin,
      4 died, and she was left with her two sons.       And they took for
        themselves wives of the daughters of Moab, the name of the
      5 one was Orpha, and the name of the other Kuth.            And when
        they had dwelt there about ten years, both Maalon and Che-
        laion died, so that the woman was bereaved of her husband,
      6 and her two sons.     Whereupon she arose with her two daugh-
         ters in law, and set out on her return from the country of Mo-
         ab ; for she had heard, in the country of Moab, that the Lord
                                                                           â€”;;
            I.                        RUTH.
       Ch.
        7 had visited his people in giving them bread.       So she set out
          from the place where she was with her two daughters in law.
        8 And when they had travelled some part of the way on their
          return to the land of Juda, Noemin said to her two daughters
          in law, Go, I pray you, return each to her mother's house.
        9 May the Lord deal kindly with you, as you have done with
          the dead, and with me.      The Lord grant, that you may find
       10 rest, each in the house of her husband.      So she kissed them,
          and they wept aloud, and said to her, We will go back with
       11 thee to thy people.   But Noemin said, Return, I pray you, my
          daughters ! for why should you go with me ?        Have I yet any
       12 more sons in my womb to be husbands for you ? Return, I
          pray you, my daughters ! For I am too old to have a husband
          for should I say, I am in condition to marry, and should I bear
      13 sons, would you wait for them till they grow up; or should
          you be restrained by them from having husbands? No, my
          daughters.   Indeed it grieveth me much for your sakes, that the
          hand of the Lord hath gone forth against me.
      14      And when they had raised their voice, and wept again,
          Orpha kissed her mother in law, and returned to her people ;
      15 but Ruth followed her.      Then Noemin said to Ruth ; Behold
          thy sister in law is gone back to her people, and to her gods,
      16 return thou also, I pray thee, after thy sister in law.     Where-
          upon Ruth said, Force me not to leave thee, nor to return
          from following thee ; for whither soever thou goest, I will go
          and wherever thou lodgest, I will lodge.      Thy people shall be
          my people ; and thy God, my God ; and wherever thou diest, I
      17 will die, and there will I be buried.   The Lord do so to me and
      18 more also, if any thing but death shall part me and thee.      And
         when Noemin saw that she was steadfastly determined to go
      19 with her, she refrained from speaking to her any more.           So
          they both proceeded on till they came to Bethlehem.           And
          when they arrived at Bethlehem, all the city was moved about
      20 them, and they said, Is this Noemin ? But she said to them,
          Call me not, I pray you, Noemin.        Call me, Bitter: for the
      21 Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.        I went out full
          but the Lord hath brought me back empty.        Why therefore do
          you call me Noemin, seeing the Lord hath brought me low,
          and the Almighty hath afflicted me ?
    Ch. II.                       EUTH.
    22     Thus Noemin returned, with Kuth the Moabitess', her
        daughter in law ; and having returned from the country of
        Moab, they came to Bethlehem, at the beginning of the bar-
    II.    ley harvest.  Now Noemin had a kinsman of her husband's ;
        a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his
     2 name was Boaz.      And Kuth the Moabitess said to Noemin,
        Let me go, I pray thee, into the field, and glean among the
        stubble after him in whose eyes I shall find favour. And she said
     3 to her, Go, my daughter.    So she went, and coming into a field,
        gleaned after the reapers.   Now she happened to light upon
        the part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who was of the
     4 kindred of Elimelech.     And behold Boaz came from Bethle-
        hem, and said to the reapers, The Lord be with you !        And
     5 they said to him, The Lord bless thee.       Then Boaz said to
        his servant, who was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is
     6 that?   And the servant who was over the reapers said in re-
        ply, It is the Moabitess girl, who came with Noemin from the
     7 country of Moab.    She said, Let me, I pray thee, glean, and
        gather among the sheaves after the reapers.   So she came, and
        hath been on her feet from early in the morning, and is con-
        tinuing on till evening.   She hath not rested a moment in the
     8 field.  Then Boaz said to Kuth, Hearest thou not, my daugh-
        ter ? Thou must not go to glean in any other field, nor must
      9 thou go hence, but abide here fast by my maids, let thy eyes
        be on the field where they reap and go after them.     Behold I
        have given a charge to my servants not to touch thee, and
        when thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of what the
     10 servants have drawn.    Upon which she fell on her face, and
        made an obeisance to the ground, and said to him, How have
        I found favour in thy sight, that thou shouldst take notice of
     11 me, seeing I am a stranger ?   And Boaz in reply said to her, I
        have been fully informed of all that thou hast done to thy mo-
        ther in law after the death of thy husband ; and how thou hast
        left thy father, and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, to
     12 come to a people whom thou knewest not heretofore.          The
        Lord recompense thy work, and may a full reward be given
        thee by the Lord God of Israel, to whom thou art come, to
     13 put thy trust under his wings.   And she said, Let me find fa-
        vour in thy sight, my Lord, for thou hast comforted me.    Now
            VOL. i.                  3 L
      Ch. III.                        KUTH.
         because thou hast spoken affectionately to thy servant, behold
      14 let me therefore be like one of thy maid servants.       Then Boaz
         said to her, It is now meal time, draw near, and eat of the bread,
         and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.       So Kuth sat down by the
         side of the reapers.    And Boaz helped her to a large piece of
         barley bread, so that she eat, and was satisfied, and had some
      15 left.  And when she arose to glean, Boaz gave a charge to his
          servants, saying, Let her glean among the sheaves, and put
      16 her not to the blush.     And when you carry out, carry out for
          her.  Leave also for her some out of the bundles, and let her
      17 eat, and glean, and rebuke her not.      So she gleaned in the field
          tillevening, and beat out what she had gathered, and it was
          about an epha of barley.     And she took it up, and went to the
      18 city.   And when her mother in law saw what she had gathered,
          and Kuth had taken out, and given her some of the bread that
      19 was left after she had been satisfied, her mother in law said to
          her, Where hast thou gleaned to day ?        And where hast thou
          been at work ?    Blessed be he who hath taken notice of thee.
          And when Kuth told her mother in law where she had been at
      20 work, and said, The man's name is Boaz, with whom I work-
          ed to day.   Noemin said to her daughter in law, Blessed is he
          of the Lord, because he hath not dropped his kindness to the
          living, nor to the dead.    Then Noemin said to her, The man is
      21 near of kin to us.      He is one of our nearest relations.      And
          Kuth said to her mother in law, Indeed he also said to me,
          Thou must keep close by my maids till they finish my whole
      22 harvest.    And Noemin said to her daughter in law Kuth, it is
          good my daughter that thou hast gone out with his maids,
       23 therefore let them not meet thee in another field.          So Kuth
          kept fast by the maids of Boaz, to glean till they finished the
       III.     barley and wheat harvest.     Then she abode at home with
          her mother in law.      And Noemin her mother in law said to
           her, My daughter, shall I not seek a rest for thee, that it may
        2 be well with thee ?     Now is not Boaz our relation, with whose
           girls thou hast been ?    Behold he is winnowing barley in the
        3 threshing floor.    This very night therefore thou shalt wash,
           and anoint thyself, and put on thy raiment, and go up to the
           threshing floor.  But make not thyself known to the man till
        4 he hath done eating and drinking.          And when he goeth to
       1
      Ch. IV.                         RUTH.
          rest, mark the place where he lieth down, and go and uncover
          his feet, and lie down, and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
       5 And Ruth said to her, All that thou hast ordered me I will do.
       6 So she went up to the threshing floor, and did all that her mo
       7 ther in law commanded her.         And when Boaz had eaten, and
         drunk, and his heart was cheered, he went and lay down at
         the side of a heap of corn.       Then she went in softly and un-
       8 covered his feet.    And in the middle of the night the man was
         astonished, and troubled, for lo ! a woman was lying at his
       9 feet.  And he said, Who art thou ?        And she said, I am Ruth
         thy handmaid ; therefore spread thy skirt over thy handmaid,
      10 for thou art near a kinsman.       And Boaz said, Blessed art thou
         of the Lord God, my daughter ; for thou hast shewn more
         kindness in this last act than in the former, in not going after
      1  young men either poor or rich.      Now therefore, my daughter, be
         not afraid, I will do for thee all thou hast said ; for all the tribe
      12 of my people know that thou art a virtuous woman.            Now in-
         deed it is true that I am a near relation ; but there is a rela-
      13 tion nearer of kin than I.     Tarry this night, and it shall be, in
         the morning, that if he perform to thee the part of a kinsman,
         well : let him do so.    But if he decline to perform to thee the
         part of a kinsman, I myself will do the kinsman's part for thee,
      14 as the Lord liveth.    Go to sleep till the morning.    So she lay at
         his feet till the morning, and arose before one could know
         another.   And Boaz said, Let it not be known that a woman
      15 came to the threshing floor.      Then he said to her, Bring the
         sash which is girt about thee.      So she held it, and he measured
         six measures of barley, and laid it on her, and went to the city.
      16 And Ruth went to her mother in law.         And her mother in law
      17 said to her, My daughter ! And when Ruth had told her all
         that the man had done to her ; and said to her, He gave me al-
      18 so these six measures of barley ; for said he to me, Thou must
         not go empty to thy mother in law ; she said, Sit still my daugh-
         ter till thou know the issue of this matter ; for the man will not
         rest till the affair is now brought to a conclusion.
      IY.     And Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there.            And
         behold when the kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken was pas-
         sing by, Boaz said to him, Turn aside and sit down here thou
       2 hidden man.      So he turned aside, and sat down.        Then Boaz
                                                                                                                             :;
                                                             KUTH.
          Ch. IV.
                took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit down here.
            3 And when they had taken their seats, Boaz said to the kins-
                man, With respect to that portion of the field which belonged
                to our brother Elimelech, and which is given to JSToemin, who
                is returned from the country of Moab, I have promised to open
            4 thine ear, saying, Purchase it in the presence of these men who
                are sitting here, even in the presence of the elders of my peo-
                ple.      If thou wilt do the kinsman's part, do it ; but if thou wilt
                not perform the office of a kinsman, tell me, that I may know
                for there is none besides thee to perform the office of a kins-
                man, except myself, who am next after thee.                                         And he said, I
            5 will do the kinsman's part.                           Then Boaz said, On the clay thou
                purchasest the field of Noemin, thou must purchase it with
                Euth, the ]\Ioabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name
            6 of the dead on his inheritance.                               Thereupon the relation said,
                I cannot take upon me the office of a kinsman, lest I mar my
                own inheritance.               Take thou upon thyself that office of a kins-
                man which is my right ; for I cannot perform it.                                           Now it was
                the custom heretofore in Israel, in regard to the transfer of the
                right of consanguinity, in order to give it validity, that the
                man loosed his sandal, and gave it to his neighbour, who took
                upon him his right of consanguinity, and this was the evidence
            8 in Israel.           So when the relation said to Boaz, Purchase thou
                for thyself, what by the law of consanguinity it was my right
            9 to purchase, he loosed his sandal, and gave it to him.                                               There-
                upon Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are
                this day witnesses that I have purchased all that belonged to
                Elimelech, and all that belonged to Chelaion and Maalon, at
          10 the hand of Xoemin ; and that I have purchased Euth, the
                Moabitess, the wife of Maalon, to be a wife to myself, to raise
                up the name of the deceased on his inheritance ; that the name
                of the deceased may not be blotted out from among his bre-
                thren, and from the tribe of his people.                                 You are this day wit-
          11 nesses.            And all the people who were in the gate said, We
                are witnesses.            Then the elders said, The Lord make this thy
                wife who is coming to thy house, like Eachel and like Leia,
                who both built up the house of Israel, and laid the foundation
                of power in Ephratha, that there may be a name in Bethlehem
          12 And may thy house be like the house of Phares, whom Tha-
     Ch. IV.                        RUTH.
        mar bore to Juda, from the seed which the Lord will give thee
        from this young woman.      So Boaz took Ruth, and she became
        his wife, and he went in unto her, and the Lord gave her con-
     14 ception, and she bore a son.      Whereupon the women said to
        Noernin, Blessed be the Lord who hath not left thee this day
        without a kinsman to make thy name famous in Israel.             He
        shall be to thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old
        age.   For thy daughter in law, who loved thee, hath brought
     16 forth a son.   She is better to thee than seven sons.     And Noe-
        min took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became its
        nurse, and the neighbours gave it a name, saying, A son is
        born to Noemin, and called its name Obed.        He was the father
         of Jessai, the father of David.
     18     Xow this is the genealogy of Phares.      Phares begot Esrom,
         and Esrom begot Aram ; and Aram begot Aminadab ; and
        Aminadab, Naasson ; and Xaasson, Salmon ; and Salmon, Boaz ;
        and Boaz, Obed ; and Obed, Jessai ; and Jessai, David.
                         I. KINGS, OR I. SAMUEL.
     I.      There was a man of Armathaim-Sipha, of mount Ephraim,
        whose name was Elkana, son of Jeremeel, son of Eliu, son of
      2 Thoke, at Nasib-Ephraim.      And he had two wives.       The name
        of the one was Anna, and the name of the other Phennana.
      3 And Phennana had children ; but Anna had not a child.           And
        this man went up, year after year, out of his cityâ€”from Ar-
        mathaim, to worship, and sacrifice to the Lord God of Sabba-
        oth, at Selom; for Eli and his two sons, Ophni and Phineas,
      4 the priests of the Lord, were there.       And his custom was, on
        the day when Elkana had offered sacrifices, he gave portions
      5 to his wife Phennana, and her children, and to Anna he gave
        one portion, because she had not a child.       Nevertheless, Elka-
        na loved Anna more than the other, though the Lord had shut
      6 up her womb.       But because the Lord had not given her a
         child, such was her affliction and anxiety on the account of
         this, that she became disconsolate, because the Lord had shut
      7 up her womb, so as not to give her a child.          Thus he acted,
         year after year, when he went up to the house of the Lord.
         And when she was become disconsolate, and was weeping,
             I.                  I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
        Ch.
         8 and did not eat, Elkana her husband said to her, Anna ! and she
            said to him, Here, my lord. And he said to her, What is the mat-
            ter with thee, that thou weepest ?        And why dost thou not eat ?
            And why is thy heart grieved ?         Am not I better to thee than
         9 ten sons?      Thereupon Anna rose up, after they had eaten at
            Selom, and stood before the Lord.             Now Eli the priest was
            sitting on the seat at4the door posts of the temple of the Lord.
       10 And she being in bitterness of soul, prayed to the Lord, and
       11 wept sore.      And she vowed a vow to the Lord, saying,                Ado-
            nai, Lord, Eloe Sabbaoth ! If thou wilt look on the affliction of
            thy handmaid, and remember me, and give thy handmaid a
            man child, I will dedicate him before thee, as a gift to the day
            of his death; and he shall not drink wine, nor fermented li-
        12 quor, nor shall a razor come on his head.              And while she was
            continuing her prayer before the Lord, Eli the priest observed
        13 her mouth.        When she spoke in her heart, her lips moved,
            but her voice was not heard, so Eli thought that she was
        14 drunk.     Thereupon Eli's servant said to her, How long wilt
            thou be drunk ?       Take away thy wine, and depart from the pre-
        15 sence of the Lord,          xlnd Anna answered, and said, No, my
            lord.   I am a woman in deep affliction.          I have not drunk wine
            nor strong drink ; but am pouring out my soul before the Lord.
        16 Count not thy handmaid a daughter of wickedness, because,
            out of the abundance of my deep meditation, I have continued
        17 till now.     Then Eli in reply said to her, Go in peace.               May
            the God of Israel grant thee thy petition, which thou hast
        18 asked of him.        And she said, Thy servant hath found favour
            in thy sight.       Then the woman went away, and when she
            came to her lodging, she ate and drank with her husband, and
        19 her countenance was no more dejected.              And they arose early
            in the morning, and worshipped the Lord, and set out on their
            journey.     And when Elkana came to his house at Armathaim,
            he knew his wife Anna ; and the Lord remembered her, and
        20 she conceived, and at the appointed time bore a son, and call-
            ed his name Samuel, because, said she, I asked him of the
        21 Lord God of Sabbaoth.           And when the man Elkana went up,
            with his household, to offer at Selom his annual sacrifice, and
            his vows, and all the tythes of his land, Anna did not go up
        22 with him ; for she said to her husband, Not till the boy can go
                                                                           ;             ;      â€”
      Ch. II.                           I.   KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
            up after I have weaned him, that he may appear before the
      23 Lord, and abide there continually.                                  And Elkana her husband
            said to her, Do what seemeth good in thine eyes.                                     Stay till thou
           hast weaned him.                 And may the Lord establish what hath pro-
      24 ceeded from thy mouth.                            So the woman staid at home, and
            suckled the child.                 And when she had weaned him, she went
           up with her husband to Selom, with a bull of three years old,
           and bread, and an epha of fine flour, and a nebal of wine, and
           came to the house of the Lord at Selom, and the boy with
      25 them.           And when they had presented him before the Lord,
           and his father had slain the victim, which he offered yearly to
            the Lord, he presented the boy, and slew the bull, and Anna,
           the mother of the child, presented him before Eli, and said,
      26 Attend to me, my lord !                          As thy soul liveth, I am the woman
           who stood in thy presence with thee when I prayed to the
      27 Lord.            For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath granted me
           the petition which I asked of him ; therefore I dedicate him to
      28 the Lord, all the days of his life, as a loan to the Lord.                                            Then
           she said,
      II.         My heart was strengthened by the Lord ;
                 By my God, my horn was exalted
                 Over my enemies my mouth was enlarged
                 I was made glad by thy salvation.
        2            Because there is none holy like the Lord,
                 And none is righteous like our God,
                  There is none holy besides thee.
        3            Boast not, nor speak haughtily,
                 Let not arrogance proceed from your mouth.
                     Because the Lord is a God of all knowledge
                 A God who prepareth his own designs ;
        4         The bow of the mighty he hath made weak.
                 And the weak have girded themselves with strength :
        5        They who were full of bread have been brought low ;
                  And they who were hungry have reached land.
                  For she who was barren hath born seven children ;
                  And she who abounded in children hath been made weak.
        6             The Lord killeth, and giveth life ;
                  He bringeth down to the grave, and raiseth up.
        7         The Lord impoverished, and maketh rich ;
                                                                                 â€”; ;;    ;
                 II.                       I.   KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
          Oh.
                     He hunibleth, and he exaltetli on high.
            8        He lifteth up the needy from the ground ;
                     And raiseth the beggar from a dunghill
                     To seat them among a people's princes
                     And he causeth them to possess a throne of glory.
            9        He granteth the petitioner his prayer,
                     And hath blessed the years of the righteous
                     Because a man is not mighty in strength,
          10         The Lord will make his adversary weak.
                                Holy is the Lord.
                     Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom,
                     Nor the mighty man boast of his power
                    Nor let the rich man boast of his riches :
                    But let him who boasteth, boast of this
                     That the Lord understandeth, and knoweth,
                     And that he executeth judgment and justice in the land.
                        The Lord ascended up to heaven and thundered ;
                    He will judge the highest on earth :
                     To our kings he giveth power,
                    And he will exalt the horn of his anointed.
         11         So she left the child there before the Lord, and returned
               to Armathaim ; and the child ministered in the presence of
               the Lord before Eli the spriest.
          12        Now the sons of Eli the priest were wicked men.                                         They
               did not know the Lord ; nor what was the priest's due from
          13 the peopleâ€”from all who offered a sacrifice ; but the servant of
          14 the priest would come when the flesh was boiling ; and having
               a three pronged flesh fork in his hand, would strike it into the
               great cauldron, or into the brass kettle, or into the pot ; and all
               that came up with the flesh fork the priest took for himself.
               In this manner they did to all the Israelites who came to sacri-
          15 rice to the Lord at Selom.                        And before the suet was burned,
               the priest's servant would come, and say to the man who was
               sacrificing, Give me flesh to roast for the priest, for I will not
          16 take boiled flesh from thee out of the kettle.                               And if the man
               who was sacrificing said, Let the suet first be burned accord-
               ing to the ritual, then take for thyself any piece thy soul de-
               sireth ; he would say, No ; thou shalt give it me now.                                    And if
          17 not; I will take it by force.                       So that the sin of these young
     Ch. II.                I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
         men was very great before the Lord; because they set at
     18 naught the sacrifice of the Lord.        But Samuel ministered be-
     19 fore the Lord, being a child girded with a linen ephod.           And
         his mother made for him a little doublet, and brought it up for
         him every year, when she came up with her husband, to offer
     20 their annual sacrifice.     Now Eli had blessed Elkana, and his
         wife saying, The Lord grant thee seed from this woman in re-
     21 turn for the loan which thou hast lent to the Lord.               And
         when the man returned to his place the Lord visited Anna,
         and she bore three sons more, and two daughters.         But the lad
         Samuel grew up before the Lord.
     22      Now Eli was very old ; and when he heard what his sons
     23 did to the children of Israel, he said to them, Why do you
         act in the manner I hear from the mouth of all the people of
     24 the Lord ?     Do not so my sons ; for the reports which I hear
     25 are not good, that the people cannot serve God.           If one man
         sin against another, intercession can be made for him to the
         Lord ; but if he sin against the Lord, who can intercede for
         him ? Butthey hearkened not to the voice of their father, where-
     26 fore the Lord determined to destroy them.          But the child Sa-
         muel proceeded on, and was in favour with the Lord, and with
     27 men.     And there came a man of God to Eli and said, Thus
         saith the Lord, I revealed myself clearly to the house of thy
         father, when they were servants to the house of Pharao, in the
     28 land of Egypt.     And I chose the house of thy father out of all
         the sceptres of Israel, to serve me in the priest's office, to go
         up to my altar, and to burn incense, and wear an ephod ; and
         I gave the house of thy father all the burnt offerings of the
     29 children of Israel for meat.      Why then hast thou looked with
         an impudent eye on my incense offerings, and on my sacrifice
         of flour, and honoured thy sons above me, by indulging them
         with the dedicated part of every sacrifice of Israel, in prefer-
      30 ence to me?      For this cause, thus saith the Lord the God of
         Israel, I said, Thy house, and the house of thy father, shall go
         out before me for ever ; but now the Lord saith, Far be this from
      31 me; for I will honour them only who honour me.               And he
         who despiseth me shall be despised.       Behold the days are com-
         ing when I will root out thy seed, and the seed of thy father's
         house ; so that thou shalt not have an old man in thy house
             vol. i.                     3 M
                                                                                                                                          !
           Ch. III.                               I.   KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
           33 for ever.               A chief man indeed for thee I will not cut off from
                  my altar, that his eyes may fail and his soul melt; but all
           34 the rest of thy house shall fall by the sword of men.                                                       And this
                  which shall come upon thy two sons, shall be a sign to thee.
                  Ophni and Phineas shall both be put to death on the same day.
           35 And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do all
                 that is in my heart and in my mind ; and I will build for him
                  a faithful house, and he shall go out before my anointed for
           36 ever.            And it shall be, that he who is left in thy house, will
                  come to bow down before him, for a piece of silver, saying,
                  Put me into one of the priestly offices that I may eat bread.
           III.            Now when the child Samuel was ministering to the Lord
                  before Eli the priest (in those days the word of the Lord was
             2 preciousâ€”there was no distinct vision) it came to pass at that
                 time, when Eli was sleeping in his place, his eyes having then
             3 begun to be heavy, so that he could not see, and before the lamp
                  of God was replenished, and Samuel was sleeping at the temple,
                  where the ark of God was, the Lord called, Samuel ! Samuel
             4 Whereupon he said, Here I am, and ran to Eli, and said, Here I
             5 am, for thou didst call me.                            And he said, I did not call thee.                             Ee-
             6 turn, and go to sleep. So he returned and went to sleep. And the
                  Lord again called Samuel ! Samuel !                                    Whereupon he went to Eli,
                  a second time, and said, Here I am ; for thou didst call me.                                                     And
             7 he said I did not call thee, Keturn, and go to sleep.                                                 Thus before
                  Samuel knew God, or the word of the Lord was revealed to him,
             8 the Lord proceeded to call Samuel the third time ; whereupon
                  Samuel arose, and went to Eli, and said, Here I am, for thou
             9 didst call me.                    Then Eli conjectured that the Lord had called
                 him; therefore he said, Keturn my son, and go to sleep, and
                  if he call thee thou shalt say, Speak, for thy servant heareth.
           10 So Samuel went, and lay down in his place, and the Lord
                  came, and stood over against him, and called him as before.
           11 And Samuel said, Speak for thy servant heareth.                                                   Then the Lord
                  said to Samuel, Behold I am about to execute my words in Is-
                  rael, at which both the ears of every one who heareth them shall
           12 tingle.             In that day I will bring upon Eli all that I have spoken
           13 against his house, I will begin and completely finish.                                                          I have
                  indeed told him that I will take vengeance on his house for
                  ever, for the iniquities of his sons.                                      Because his sons spoke
                                                                                                                          ;
         Ch. IV.                           I.   KINGSâ€”T. SAMUEL.
        14 evil of God, and be did not chastise them, therefore I have
              sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall
        15 not be expiated with incense or sacrifices for ever.                                             And Sa-
              muel lay till the morning, and arose early in the morning, and
              opened the doors of the house of the Lord, but was afraid to
        16 tell the vision.                 Then Eli said to Samuel, Samuel, my son !
        17 And he said, Here I am.                              And he said, What was the word
              spoken to thee ?               Hide it not from me, I pray thee.                            God do so
              to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me, of all
        18 that was spoken to thee in thy hearing.                                   Then Samuel told him
              all the words.            He did not hide any thing from him.                                   Where-
              upon Eli said, He is the Lord.                              He will do what is good in
              his sight.
        19          And Samuel grew up, and the Lord was with him, so that
        20 not one of his words fell to the ground.                                     And all Israel, from.
              Dan to Bersabee, knew that Samuel was a faithful prophet of
        21 the Lord.             And the Lord continued to manifest himself at Se-
              lom ; for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel, and it was con-
              fidently believed that Samuel would be the prophet of the
              Lord to all Israel, from one end of the land to the other.
        IV.           Now Eli was very old, and his sons continued their cour-
              ses.     And their way was evil in the sight of the Lord.                                             And
              in those days the Philistines assembled for war against Israel
              and Israel went out to meet them for battle, and encamped at
          2 Abenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek.                                                And the
              Philistines drew up in array for battle against Israel, and the
              battle was unfavourable ; for Israel gave way before the Philis-
              tines, and there were smitten in the engagement, on the field
          3 of battle, four thousand men.                             And when the people came to
              the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why hath the Lord caused
              us this day to shrink before the Philistines ?                                  Let us fetch the
              ark of our God from Selom, and let it go forth from the midst
          4 of us, and it will save us out of the hands of our enemies.                                                So
              the people sent to Selom, and brought thence the ark of the Lord
              who is enthroned on the cherubim.                               And both the sons of Eli,
          5 Ophni and Phineas, went with the ark.                                     And when the ark of
              the Lord came to the camp, all Israel shouted with a great
          6 shout, and the earth resounded.                           Upon hearing the noise of the
              shouting, the Philistines said, What great shouting is this in
                                                                                                                            ;

           7 the camp of the Hebrews ?                              And when they understood that
               the ark of the Lord was come to the camp, the Philistines were
               struck with terror, and said, The gods are come to them into
               the camp.          Alas for us ?           Deliver us,            Lord, this day ! for such a
           8 thing hath never been done heretofore.                                  Alas for us !           Who can
               deliver us out of the hands of these strong gods ?                                           These are
               the gods who continued smiting Egypt with every plague : and
           9 in the wildernessâ€”Be strong and quit yourselves like men,
              Philistines, that you may not become slaves to the Hebrews, as
         10 they have been to us.                          Quit yourselves like men, and fight
              them.         So they fought them, and Israel gave way, and fled
              every man to his tent.                      And there was a very great slaughter
         11 and there fell of Israel thirty thousand warriors.                                     And the ark of
               God was taken, and Ophni and Phineas, the two sons of Eli,
         12 were both slain.                 And there ran a Jeminite from the battle, and
               came to Selom the same day, with his clothes rent and dust
         13 on his head.                And when he came, lo !                        Eli was sitting on his
               seat, by the gate, watching the way; for his heart trembled
         14 for the ark of God.                    And when the man went into the city, and
               told the news, the city raised a cry.                                 And upon hearing the
               sound of the cry, Eli said, What noise of crying is this ?                                           Then
         15 the man came in haste, and told Eli.                                        Now Eli was ninety
               years of age, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see.
               And just as Eli said to the men who stood round him, What
         16 noise of crying is this ?                        The man came in haste to Eli, and
               said to him, I am he who came the from army, and fled to-day
         17 from the engagement.                          Whereupon Eli said, What was the is-
               sue, my son?                And the young man in reply, said, Israel fled
               before the face of the Philistines, and there was a great slaugh-
               ter among the people, and both thy sons are dead, and the ark
         18 of God is taken.                     Soon as he mentioned the ark of God, Eli
               fell backward from his seat by the gate, and his back was
               broken, and he died ; for he was an old man and heavy.                                                Now
         19 he had judged Israel twenty years.                                 And when his daughter in
               law, the wife of Phineas, who was with child, heard the news,
               that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and
               her husband were dead, she burst into tears and travailed, for
         20 her pains came upon her.                            And when she was at the point of
               death, the women who attended her, said, Fear not, for thou
                                                                                                                                                     :
          Ch. V.                                     I.   KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
          21 hast brought forth a son ; but she made them no answer
                 her heart regarded it not ; but she called her son Ouaibarcha-
                 both, for the ark of God, and for her father in law, and for her
          22 husband.                    And they said, The glory departed from Israel,
                 when the ark of the Lord was taken.
          V.              Now when the Philistines had taken the ark of God, they
            2 carried it from Abenezer to Azotus.                                                 And the Philistines took
                 the Ark of the Lord, and carried it into the temple of Dagon,
            3 and set it beside Dagon.                                     But when the Azotians arose in the
                 morning, and went into the temple of Dagon, they looked, and
                 lo ! Dagon had falleu on its face before the ark of God.                                                                There-
                 upon they raised up Dagon, and set him in his place.                                                                 But the
                 hand of the Lord was heavy on the Azotians ; and he afflicted
                 them, and smote them in the hinder parts, throughout Azotus
            I and its territories.                          And when they arose early next morning,
                 behold Dagon was fallen prostrate before the ark of the cove-
                 nant of the Lord ; and the head of Dagon, and both his hands,
                 had been hurled away in front of the Amapheth, and the palms
                 of both his hands had fallen on the threshold, so that nothing
            .3   but the trunk of Dagon was left.                                         For this cause the priests of
                 Dagon, and every one who goeth into the temple of Dagon, do
                 not, even at this day, tread on the threshold of the temple of
                 Dagon, at Azotus, but step over it.
            6           Still the hand of the Lord was heavy upon Azotus, and
                 pressed them down.                           Leaks broke out in their vessels, and their
                 country swarmed with mice, aud in the city there was a great
             7 confusion of mortality.                               And when the men of Azotus saw that
                 this was the case, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall
                 not abide with us, for his hand is grievous upon us, and our
             8 god Dagon.                      So they seut, and convened to them the lords of
                  the Philistines, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the
                  God of Israel ?                     Whereupon the Gethites said, Let the ark of
             9 the God come to us.                                So the ark of the God of Israel went to
                  Geth.           And when it went there, the hand of the Lord was upon
                  that city, with very great destruction, and smote the men of
                  that city, both small and great.                                     He smote them in their hinder
           10 parts, and the Gethites made stools for themselves.                                                                Then they
                  sent the ark of God to Ascalon.                                             But when the ark of God
                  came to Ascalon, the Ascalonites cried out saying, Why have
                              I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
      Ch. VI.
          you brought the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and
      11 our people ?      So they sent and assembled the lords of the Phi-
          listines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and
      12 let it abide in its own place, and not kill us and our people.         For
          a very deadly disorder broke out in the city, as soon as the ark
          of the God of Israel entered there; and they who were alive,
          and had not yet died, were smitten in their hinder parts.            And
          the cry of the city ascended up to heaven.
      VI.      When the ark had been in the country of the Philistines
          seven months, and the land poured forth swarms of mice, the
        2 Philistines then called for their priests, and their diviners, and
          their sorcerers, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the
        3 Lord?     Tell us how we shall send it to its place.         Whereupon
          they said, If you send away the ark of the covenant of the Lord
          God of Israel, you must not send it away empty, but make
          some atonement for the injury done it, and then you shall be
       4 healed, and he will be appeased with you : otherwise his hand
          will not be removed from you.           And they said, What atone-
          ment shall we make to it ?         To which they replied, According
          to the number of the lords of the Philistines, five golden
        5 stools, for this is correspondent to the plague among you, both
          among your chiefs and people ; and golden mice, as a sem-
          blance of those mice of yours, which destroy the land.               And
          you shall give glory to the Lord, that he may remove his hand
        6 from you, and from your gods, and from your land.              Now why
          do you continue obstinate, as Egypt and Pharao did ?                  Did
          they not when he had insulted them, send the people away,
        7 and they departed ?       Now therefore, take and provide a new
          cart, and two heifers lately calved, without their young, and
          yoke the heifers to the cart, and bring home their calves from
        8 them.    Then take the ark, and put it in the cart, with the jew-
          els of gold which you shall give for an atonement, and lay them
          on a bed, Bersechthan, by its side, and send it away.                And
        9 when you have driven it off, you shall quit it, and look.            If it
          taketh the road to its own borders, leading by Baithsamus,
          then hath he done us this great evil ; but if not, we shall then
          know that his hand hath not touched us, but that this is a ca-
      10 sualty which hath befallen us. Accordingly the Philistines did so.
          They took two heifers which had lately calved, and yoked them
     Cb. VII.               I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
      11 to the cart, and shut up their calves at home; and laid the ark
         of the Lord in the cart, with the bed Ergab, and the golden
     12 mice.    And the cows took the straight road to the high way
         leading to Baithsamus, and proceeded on in one track, and
         though fatigued, they turned not aside to the right, nor to the
         left.  And the lords of the Philistines followed it to the bor-
         ders of Baithsamus.
     13      Now the people of Baithsamus were reaping their wheat
         harvest in the valley ; and when they raised their eyes, and saw
     14 the ark of the Lord, they rejoiced at meeting it.        So when the
         cart came into the field of Osea of Baithsamus, they set up
         there a great stone near it.   Then cutting to pieces the wood of
         the cart, they offered the cows as a whole burnt offering to the
     15 Lord.    Then the Levites took up the ark of the Lord, and the
         bed Ergab with it, and the jewels of gold which were by it,
     16 and laid them on the great stone.      And the men of Baithsamus
         offered whole burnt offerings, and sacrifices, that day to the
         Lord.   And when the five lords of the Philistines saw this,
     17 they returned to Ascalon the same day.          Now these were the
         golden stools which the Philistines gave for an atonement to
         the Lordâ€”one for Azotus, one for Gaza, one for Ascalon,
     18 one for Gath, and one for Akkaron.           And the golden mice
         were according to the number of all the cities which belonged
         to the five lords of the Philistines, from the fenced city to the
         village of the Pherezites, and to the great stone, on which they
         had laid the ark of the Lord, and which is in the field of Osea,
         the Baithsamite.
     19      But among the men of Baithsamus, the sons of Jechonias
         did not receive it with joyâ€”because they looked into the ark
         of the Lord, therefore he smote among them seventy men, in-
         cluding fifty of the men's chiliad.        Thereupon the people
         mourned, because the Lord had inflicted a very great blow on
     20 that community ; and the men of Baithsamus said, Who will
         be able to pass by before the Lord, the holy God ?          And, To
     21 whom shall the ark of the Lord go up from us.        Then they sent
         messengers to the inhabitants of Kariathiarim, saying, The
         Philistines have sent back the ark of the Lord, Come down
     VII.      and take it up to you.    Thereupon the men of Kariathia-
         rim went, and carried up the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
       Ch. VII.              I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
           and brought it to the house of Aininadab, who dwelt on the
           hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the co-
        2 venant of the Lord.    And from the day the ark was at Kariathia-
          rim, days were multiplied, and twenty years elapsed.            And
        3 when all the house of Israel looked back after the Lord,
          Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If with your
          whole heart you turn to the Lord, put away the strange gods
          from among you, and the bowers, and prepare your hearts for
          the Lord, and serve him alone, and he will deliver you out of
        4 the hand of the Philistines.     And when the children of Israel
          had put away the Baals, and the bowers of Astaroth, and serv-
        5 ed the Lord alone, Samuel said, Assemble all Israel to Mas-
        6 sepha, and I will pray to the Lord for you.      So they assembled
          at Massepha, and drew water, and poured it out before the
          Lord, on the ground, and fasted that day, and said, We have
          sinned before the Lord.      And Samuel judged the children of
          Israel at Massepha.
        7     Now when the Philistines heard that all the children of Is-
          rael were assembled at Massepha, the lords of the Philistines
          came up against Israel.     Upon hearing this the children of Is-
          rael were terrified because of the Philistines, and said to Sa-
        8 muel, Cease not to cry to the Lord thy God for us, that he
        9 may save us out of the hand of the Philistines.          Thereupon
           Samuel took a sucking lamb, and, with all the people, offered
           it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord.    And Samuel cried to
       10 the Lord for Israel ; and the Lord heard him.        Now while Sa-
          muel was offering the whole burnt offering, the Philistines
           advanced to battle against Israel ; and the Lord thundered that
           day with a great voice against the Philistines, and they were
       11 discomfited, and fled before Israel.   And the men of Israel went
           out from Massepha, and pursued the Philistines, and smote
       12 them to below Baithcor.       Then Samuel took a stone, and set
           it up between Massepha and the old town, and called its name
           Abenezer, (the stone of the helper ;) for he said, Even at this
       13 place the Lord helped us.      And the Lord humbled the Philis-
           tines so that they came no more into the borders of Israel.
           And the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the
       14 days of Samuel ; So that the cities which the Philistines had
           taken from the Israelites were restored.     They delivered them
       Oh. VIII.              I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
          up to Israel, from Ascalon to Azob.         So Israel recovered their
          border out of the hauds of the Philistiues.       And there was peace
      15 between Israel and the Amorites.           And Samuel judged Israel
      16 all the days of his life, and went yearly, in rotation, to Baithel,
          and Galgala, and Massepha, and judged Israel in all those holy
      17 places.    And his return was to Armathaim; for his house was
          there.   And there he judged Israel, and there he built an altar
          to the Lord.
      VIII.       Now when Samuel grew old he appointed his sons
       2 judges over Israel.     And these were the names of his sons.         His
          first born was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abia.
       3 They were judges in Bersabee.           But his sons did not walk in
       4 his way.     They turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and
       5 perverted justice.     Whereupon all the chief men of Israel as-
          sembled, and came to Armathaim, to Samuel, and said to him,
          Behold thou art grown old, and thy sons do not walk in thy
          way.   Now therefore appoint a king over us to judge us like
       6 the other nations.      And the thing was evil in the sight of Sa-
       7 muel, that they should say, Give us a king to judge us.              And
          Samuel prayed to the Lord.          And the Lord said to Samuel,
          Hearken to the voice of this people as they have spoken to thee.
          For they have not rejected thee; but they have rejected me,
       8 that I should not reign over them.          According to all that they
          have done to me, from the day I brought them out of Egypt
          even to this dayâ€”as they have forsaken me, and served strange
       9 gods, so they do also to thee.        Now therefore hearken to their
          voice.   Nevertheless testify to them, and tell them the preroga-
      10 tive of the king who shall reign over them.           Upon this Samuel
      11 told the people who asked of him a king, all the words of the
          Lord, and said, This will be the prerogative of the king who
          shall reign over you.    He will take your sons, and appoint them
      12 for his chariots, and for his horsemen, and some to run before
          his chariots, and others to be made for him captains of hun-
          dreds, and captains of thousands, and some to reap his harvest,
          and gather his vintage, and to make his implements of war, and
      13 arms for his chariots.     And he will take your daughters for con-
      14 fectioners, and cooks, and bakers.       And he will take your fields,
          and your vineyards, and your olive orchards, and give them to
      15 his slaves.    And he will take the tenth of your crops, and vine-
               vol. i.                      3 N
                               KINGS-I. SAMUEL.
       Ch. IX.              I.
       16 yards, and give it to his officers and vassals.   He will take also
          your men servants, and your maid servants, and the best of
          your herds, and your asses, even the tenth of them, for his own
       17 works.   He will also take a tenth of your flocks ; and you shall
       18 be his slaves.   And in that day you will cry aloud, because of
          your king whom you have chosen for yourselves : but the Lord
          will not hearken to you in those days, because you have chosen
       19 a king for yourselves.     But the people would not hearken to
       20 Samuel, but said to him, None but a king shall be over us.       We
           will be like all the nations, and our king shall judge us, and
       21 go out before us, and fight our battles.        And when Samuel
           heard all the words of the people, and rehearsed them in the
       22 hearing of the Lord, the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken to their
           voice, and appoint a king over them.     Then Samuel said to the
           men of Israel, Depart every man to his city.
       IX.      Now there was a man of the children of Benjamin whose
           name was Kis, son of Abiel, son of Jared, son of Bachir, son
        2 of Aphek, son of Jemenaius, the head of the family.          He was
           a man in authority ; and he had a son whose name was Saul,
           a man of great stature, and comely appearance.           There was
           not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he.
           From the shoulders and upwards he was taller than any in
        3 the land.    And the asses of Kis, Saul's father, being lost, Kis
           said to his son Saul, Take with thee one of the servants, and
        4 arise, and go seek the asses.          So when they had passed
           through mount Ephraim, they passed through the land of Sel-
           cha, but found them not.     Then they passed through the land
           of Segalin, but they were not there, then they passed through
         5 the land of Jamin but did not find them.          And when they
           came to Siph, Saul said to the servant who was with him,
           Come, let us return, lest my father, forgetting the asses, be
         6 concerned for us.    Thereupon the servant said to him, Behold,
           I pray thee, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man in
           high repute.   Whatever he saith will surely come to pass.     Now
           therefore let us go, that he may tell us which way we should
         7 go.   And Saul said to the servant who was with him, But be-
           hold, if we go what can we carry to the man of God ?            For
           the bread in our vessels is spent, and we have nothing else with
         8 us to carry to the man of God.      In reply to which the servant
      Ch. IX.               I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
         again said to Saul, Behold I have in my hand a quarter of a shekel
         of silver, thou shalt give that to the man of God, that he may tell
       9 us our way.    Now heretofore in Israel, when any one went to
         consult God, he spoke thus, Gome let us go to the Seer; for
      10 the people in former times called the prophet, Seer.            Then
         Saul said to his servant, It is well, Come, let us go.       So they
      11 went to the city, Avhere the man of God was.           And as they
         were going up the ascent to the city, they met the women
         coming out to draw water, and said to them, Is the Seer here ?
      12 And the women in reply said to them, He is.        Behold he is be-
         fore you.   He has just come to the city to-day, because there
      13 is, to-day, a sacrifice for the people in the Bama.     So when you
         enter the city you will find him there, before he goeth up to
         the Bama to eat.     For the people will not eat till he come ; for
          he blesseth the sacrifice, and after that the guests eat.       Now
      14 therefore go up, for to-day you will find him.         So they went
          up to the city, and as they were entering into the middle of
          the city, behold Samuel came out over against them with
      15 an intent to go up to the Bama.         Now the Lord had made a
          revelation to Samuel, the day before Saul came to him, saying,
      16 About this time to-morrow I will send thee a man out of the
          land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be ruler over
          my people Israel ; and he shall save my people out of the hand
          of the Philistines ; for I have looked upon the affliction of this
      17 people ; for their cry hath come up to me.        And when Samuel
          saw Saul, the Lord said to him, Behold the man, whom I men-
      18 tioned to thee !    That man shall rule over my people.      So when
          Saul drew near to Samuel, in the midst of the city, and said
          to him, Tell me, I pray thee, which is the house of the Seer,
          Samuel in reply said to Saul, I am he.      Go up before me to the
          Bama, and dine with me to-day.         And in the morning I will
      20 dismiss thee, and tell thee all that is in thy heart.    But with re-
          spect to thy asses which were lost three days ago, give thyself
          no concern about them, for they are found.       Now for whom are
          the best things of Israel ?   Are they not for thee and thy father's
      21 house ?    Whereupon Saul answered and said, Am not I a Je-
          minite, a small sceptre of a community of Israel, and that com-
          munity the smallest of the whole sceptre of Benjamin ?          Why
      22 therefore hast thou spoken to me in this manner?        Then Samuel
       Ch. X.               I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
          took Saul, and his servant, and conducted them to the place of
          entertainment, and seated them at the head of those who were
       23 invited, who were about seventy men.      And Samuel said to the
          cook, Bring me the portion which I gave thee, and which I
       24 ordered thee to lay by.    Now the cook had boiled the shoulder,
          and when he set it before Saul, Samuel said to Saul, Behold
          what was reserved, Set it before thee and eat.       Because for a
          testimony it was laid by for thee, in preference to the rest, help
      25 thyself to it.   So Saul dined, and went down that day with Sa-
          muel from the Bama to the city, and a bed being spread for
      26 him on the house top, he went to sleep.       And Samuel went up
          to him early in the morning, and called Saul on the house top
          and said, Arise, and I will dismiss thee.     Thereupon he arose
          and went out, he and Samuel, till they were out of the city.
      27 And as they were going down to the border of the city, Sa-
          muel said to Saul, Order thy servant to go on before us ; but
      X.      stand thou still, and hear the word of God.       Then Samuel
          took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him,
          and said to him, Hath not the Lord anointed thee to be ruler
          ever his people Israel ?  Thou therefore shalt rule over the peo-
          ple of the Lord, and save them out of the hand of their enemies.
          And this shall be to thee the sign that the Lord hath anointed
       2 thee to be ruler over his heritageâ€”Soon as thou shalt depart
          from me to-day, thou wilt meet two men at Kachel's tomb, on
          mount Benjamin, coming in haste, and they will say to thee,
          The asses which you went to seek, are found ; and behold thy
          father hath left off caring for the asses, and is anxiously con-
       3 cerned for you, saying, What shall I do for my son ?      And when
          thou shalt go thence, and from that place come to the Oaks of
          Thabor, thou wilt there meet three men going up to God to
          Baithel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three bas-
       4 kets of bread, and the other carrying a flagon of wine.         And
          they will salute thee courteously, and give thee two of the best
       5 loaves, which thou shalt receive at their hand.      And after that
          thou shalt go to the mount of God, where there is a garrison
          of the Philistines under Nasib the Philistine ; And when you
         there enter the city, thou wilt meet a choir of prophets coming
          down from the Bama, with nablas, and tympanums, and pipes,
       6 and kinaras before them, and they will be prophesying ; and the
                                                                                                                                     ;
                X.                            I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
        Oh.
              Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy
          7 with theni, and be changed into another man.                                                Now when these
              signs are come to thee ; do thou as the occasion may require
          8 for God is with thee.                          But when thou shalt go down to Galgal,
              bshold I will go down to thee, to offer a burnt offering and peace
              offerings.           Thou shalt wait seven days till I come to thee.                                            And
          9 I will let thee know what thou art to do.                                                Accordingly, soon
              as he turned his back to depart from Samuel, God gave him
        10 another heart; and all the signs came to pass that day.                                                            And
              when he went thence to the mount, behold a choir of prophets
              met him, and a Spirit of God came upon him, and he pro-
        11 phesied in the midst of them.                                     Now they were all acquainted
              with him heretofore, and when they saw him among the pro-
              phets, the people said one to another, What is this which hath
              happened to the son of Kis ?                             Is Saul also among the prophets ?
        12 And some of them in reply, said, Who is his father ?                                                           There-
              fore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets ?
        13 And when he had done prophesying, and came to the mount,
              his uncle said to him and his servant, Where have you been
        14 travelling ?                And they said, To seek the asses.                                    And when we
              saw that they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.
        15 Whereupon his uncle said to Saul, Tell me, I pray thee, what
        16 did Samuel say to thee ?                               And Saul said to his uncle, He told
              me that the asses were found.                                But the matter relating to the
              kingdom he did not tell him.
        17             Then Samuel summoned all the people before the Lord,
       18 to Massepha, and said to the children of Israel, Thus hath the
              Lord the God of Israel spoken, saying, I brought the children
              of Israel up out of Egypt, and delivered them out of the
              hand of Pharao, king of Egypt, and out of the hand of all the
        19 kingdoms which oppressed you.                                      But you have this day reject-
              ed God, who is himself your Saviour from all your troubles,
              and your afflictions ; and have said Nay, but thou shalt set a
              king over us.                   Now therefore present yourselves before the
       20 Lord by your tribes and by your communities.                                                    So Samuel pre-
              sented all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin was
       21 chosen by lot.                      Then he presented the tribe of Benjamin by
              communities, and the community of Mattari was chosen by
              lot.      Then they presented the community of Mattari by indi-
       Ch. XL                 I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
       22 viduals, and Saul son of Kis, was chosen by lot.             And when
           they sought for him, he could not be found.           Whereupon Sa-
           muel again inquired of the Lord, whether he would come thi-
       23 ther.    And the Lord said, Behold he is hid among the bag-
           gage.   So one ran and took him thence, and set him in the
           midst of the people, and he was taller than the people by the
       24 shoulders and upwards.         And Samuel said to all the people,
           Have you seen him whom the Lord hath chosen for himself,
           that there is none like him among you all ?         And when all the
       25 people acknowledged him and said, God save the king; then
           Samuel told the people the prerogative of the king, and wrote
           it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord.       Then Samuel dis-
           missed all the people, and they went away, every man to his
       26 place.    And Saul went to his house at Gabaa, and there went
           with Saul a band of men, whose hearts the Lord had touched.
       27 But turbulent men said, How can this man save us ?            And they
           despised him, and did not bring him gifts.
       XL        About a month after this Nahas, the Ammanite, came up
           and encamped against Jabis Galaad, and all the men of Jabis
           Galaad said to Nahas, the Ammanite, Make a covenant with us,
         2 and we will serve thee.     Thereupon Nahas the Ammanite said to
           them, On this condition I will make a covenant with you, that I
           may put out all your right eyes, and make you a reproach to Is-
         3 rael.  And the men ofJabis said to him, Grant us seven days that
            we maysend messengers to all the borders of Israel ; and if there
         4 be none to deliver us, we will come out to thee.        Now when the
            messengers came to Gabaa, to Saul, and delivered this mes-
            sage in the hearing of the people, all the people raised their
         5 voice, and wept.      And behold Saul came, at noon, out of the
            field.  And Saul said, Why are the people weeping?                And
         6 when they told him the words of the men of Jabis, a Spirit of
            the Lord came upon him, and his anger was greatly inflamed
            against them, and taking two heifers, he cut them in pieces,
         7 and sent them to all the borders of Israel, by the hands of mes-
            sengers, saying, So shall be done to every man's cattle who
            goeth not out after Saul and after Samuel.        And a dread of the
            Lord came on all the people of Israel, and they came out as one
         8 man.     And when he had reviewed them at Bezek, in the Bama,
            the men of Israel, six hundred thousand, and the men of Juda,
                                                                                                               ;
      Oh. XII.                        I.   KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
        9 seventy thousand, he said to the messengers who came, Thus
            shall you say to the men of Jabis, To-morrow, by the time the
      10 sun is warm, you shall have help.                              So when the messengers
            came to the city, and told the men of Jabis, they were rejoiced.
            And the men of Jabis said to Nahas the Ammanite, To-mor-
            row we will come out to you, that you may do to us what is
       11 good in your sight.                   Now, on the morrow, Saul divided the
            people into three armies, and they entered the camp in the
            morning watch, and smote the Ammanites till the day grew
       12 warm ; and when they who were left, were dispersed, so that
            not two of them were found together, the people said to Sa-
            muel, Who is he who said, Saul shall not reign over us ?                                      De-
       13 liver up those men, that we may put them to death.                                        Where-
            upon Saul said, Not a man shall this day be put to death ; for
       14 to day the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel.                                      Then Sa-
            muel spoke to the people, saying, Let us go up to Galgal, and
       15 there renew the kingdom.                      So all the people went to Galgal
            and Samuel anointed Saul to be king, before the Lord, at Gal-
            gal, and there they offered sacrifices, and peace offerings before
            the Lord, and Samuel and all the people rejoiced with exceed-
            ing great joy.
       XII.          Then Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have hearken-
            ed to your voice, according to all that you said to me, and have
            made a king over you; and now behold the king goeth out
         2 before you.           As for me, I am grown old, therefore I will stay
            at home.          And as for my sons, behold they are among you.
            With regard to myself, behold I have gone out before you
        3 from my youth even to this day.                         Here I am.          Bring your com-
            plaints against me before the Lord, and before his anointed.
            Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken ? or
            whom among you have I oppressed? or whom have I ag-
            grieved ? or from whose hand have I taken a bribe, even to a
            shoe latchet ?           Witness against me, and I will make you res-
         4 titution.        Thereupon they said to Samuel, Thou hast not in-
            jured us ; nor tyrannised over us ; nor afflicted us ; nor taken
         5 any thing from the hand of any man.                            Then Samuel said to the
            people, The Lord is a witness among you, and his anointed is
            this day a witness, that you have found nothing in my hand.
         6 And they said, He is a witness.                          Then Samuel spoke to the
            XII.            I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
       Ch.
           people saying, The Lord who made Moses, and Aaron, and
        7 who brought our fathers up out of Egypt, is witness.          Now
           therefore stand up, that I may cite you to judgment before
           the Lord, and proclaim to you all the righteousness of the
        8 Lord in his dealings with you and your fathers.       When Jacob
           went down with his children to Egypt, and the Egyptians
           humbled them, your fathers cried to the Lord, and the Lord
           sent Moses and Aaron; and they brought your fathers out of
        9 Egypt.    But when he settled them in this place, they forgot
           the Lord their God, therefore he delivered them into the hands
           of Sisara, the captain general of Jabis, king of Asor, and into
           the hands of the foreign tribes, and into the hands of the king
       10 of Moab, and with these fought against them.       And when they
           cried to the Lord, and said, We have sinned, because we have
           forsaken the Lord, and served the Baals, and the groves ; but
           now deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, and we will
       11 serve thee; he sent Jerubaal, and Barak, and Jephthae, and,
           Samuel, and delivered us out of the hands of our enemies
       12 round about, and you dwelt securely.      But when you saw that
           Nahas, the king of the Ammanites, had come out against you,
       13 you said, None but a king shall reign over us.       Still however
           the Lord our God is our king, even now, (when, Lo ! the king
           whom you have chosen ; and behold the Lord hath set a king
       14 over you;) provided you fear the Lord, and serve him, and
           hearken to his voice, and dispute not the command of the Lord,
           and both you, and the king who reigneth over you, continue
       15 walking after the Lord.    But if you will not hearken to the voice
           of the Lord ; or if you dispute the command of the Lord, the
       16 hand of the Lord will be against you and your king.            Now
           therefore stand up and see this great thing which the Lord will
       17 do in your sight.    Is it not now wheat harvest ?    I will invoke
           the Lord, and he will send thunder and rain, that you may
           know, and see that the evil is great which you have done in
       18 the sight of the Lord, in asking for yourselves a king.       Then
           Samuel invoked the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain
           that very day, and all the people greatly feared the Lord and
       19 Samuel.    And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for thy ser-
           vants to the Lord thy God, that we may not die, because we
           have added evil to all our sins, in asking for ourselves a king.
                                                                                                                      ;
    Ch. XIII.                         I.   KINGSâ€”T. SAMUEL.
    20 Whereupon Samuel said to the people, Fear not.                                                 You have
          done all this evil ; yet turn not away from following the Lord ;
    21 but serve the Lord with your whole heart, and do not trans-
          gress by following those imaginary beings which can effect
    22 nothing, and which cannot deliver, for they are nothing ; for
         the Lord will not cast off his people for his great name's sake :
    23 for the Lord hath in mercy taken you for his people.                                               And as
          for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceas-
    24 ing to pray for you.                      I will indeed serve the Lord, and point
          out the good and straight way : in addition to this, fear ye the
          Lord, and serve him with truth, and with your whole heart
          for you have seen what great things he hath done with you.
    25 But if you proceed on in wickedness, both you and your king
          shall be devoted to destruction.
    XIII.             Then Saul chose for himself three thousand men from
          among the men of Israel, two thousand of whom were with
          Saul at Machmas and mount Baithel, and one thousand with
          Jonathan, at Gabaa, in Benjamin.                              And the rest of the people
      3 he dismissed every man to his tent.                                  And Jonathan smote Na-
          sib, the Philistine, who was in the fortress, and the Philistines
          heard of it, and Saul sounded a trumpet through all the land,
      4 saying, The servants have revolted.                             And when all Israel heard
          the news that Saul had smitten Nasib the Philistine ; though
          Israel had been put to shame by the Philistines, yet all the
      5 children of Israel went up after Saul to Galgala.                                                And the
          Philistines assembled for battle against Israel ; and there came
          up against Israel, thirty thousand charioteers, and six thousand
           cavalry, and people like the sand on the sea shore for multi-
          tude, and they encamped at Machmas, over against Baitho-
       6 ron, southward.                 And when Israel saw that they were strict-
           ly enjoined not to offer sacrifices, the people hid themselves
           in caves, and in dens, and among rocks, and in pits, and wells,
          and some crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad, and Ga-
       7 laad.        As for Saul, he was still at Galgal ; but all the people
       8 who followed him were in the utmost dread. And when he had
           waited seven days according to appointment, as Samuel said,
           and Samuel did not come to Galgal, and his people were dis-
       9 persed from him, Saul said, Bring your offerings, that I
           may offer a whole burnt offering and peace offerings.                                              So he
                 vol. I.                                     3 o
        Ch. XIII.             I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
        10 offered the whole burnt offering. And just as he had finished
            carrying up the whole burnt offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul
        11 went out to meet him, that he might give the blessing.        And
            Samuel said, What hast thou done?         Whereupon Saul said,
            Because I saw that the people were dispersed from me, and
           that thou wast not come, in the appointed days, and that the
        12 Philistines were assembled at Machmas, I said, Now will the
           Philistines come down upon me to Galgal, and I have not made
           my supplication to the Lord, therefore I forced myself, and
        13 offered the whole burnt offering.      And Samuel said to Saul,
           It is of no avail to thee, because thou hast not kept my com-
           mand which the Lord commanded thee.            Till now the Lord
           had prepared thy kingdom over Israel for ever : but now thy
        14 kingdom will not be continued to thee.     But the Lord will seek
           for himself a man after his own heart ; and the Lord will ap-
           point him to be ruler over his people, because thou hast not
        15 kept all that the Lord commanded thee.         Then Samuel arose,
           and departed from Galgal, and the remnant of the people went
           up after Saul, to overtake the men of war.        And when they
           were come from Galgal to Gabaa of Benjamin, Saul reviewed
        16 the people who were with him, about six hundred men.            So
           Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were with
           them, halted at Gabaa of Benjamin, and wept.
        17     Now while the Philistines lay encamped at Machmas, there
           went out spoilers from the field of the Philistines, in three
        18 bands.   One band took the way of Gophera, to the land of So-
           gel ; another took the way to Baithoron, and another took the
       19 way of Gabaa, which leadeth by Gai to Sabim.           (Now there
           was not a blacksmith to be found in all the land of Israel ; for
       20 the Philistines said, The Hebrews must not make a sword or
           a spear ; so that all the Israelites went down to the land of the
           Philistines, every one to get a scythe, or a tool made ; and
       21 every one to get his ax, or his sickle.   And when a vine dresser
           wanted to prune his vineyard, his tools cost him three shekels
           for a saw; and his ax and his pruning hook cost the same.
        22 So that in the days of the battle of Machmas there was not a
           sword, or a spear found in the hand of all the people who were
           with Saul and Jonathan.       They were to be found with Saul
           only, and Jonathan his son.)
         XIV.                I. KINGSâ€”T. SAMUEL.
     Ch.
     23     Now from the main body of the Philistines, there was an
    XIV.        advanced party on the side of Machmas.             And one day
        Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to his servant who carried his
        arms, Come, let us go over to Messab of the Philistines, that
      2 is on yonder side : but he did not tell his father.           Now Saul
        had posted himself on the top of the hill, in the pomegranate
      3 grove, at Magdon, and there were with him about six hundred
        men; and Achia, son of Achitob, the brother of Jochabed, son
        of Phineas, son of Eli, was the priest of God at Selom, wear-
        ing the ephod.      And the people did not know that Jonathan
     4 was gone.      Now in the middle of the passage where Jonathan
        sought to cross over to the army of the Philistines, there was a
        point of a rock on this side, and the point of a rock on that, the
        name of the one was Bases, and the name of the other Senna.
      5 There was one way on the north for going to Machmas, and
      6 another way on the south, for going to Gabaa.                And when
        Jonathan said to his servant who carried his arms, Come let us
        go over to Messab of these uncircumcised Philistines, it may
        be, the Lord may do something for us, for there is no restraint
        to the Lord to save by many or by few ; his armour bearer said
      7 to him, Do whatever thy heart is inclined to ; behold I am
      8 with thee.     As thy heart is, so is mine.       Then Jonathan said,
        Behold we are going to cross over to these men, therefore we
      9 must shew ourselves before them.         If they say to us, Stand off
        there till we tell you, then we must stand where we are, and
    10 not go up to them : but if they say to us, Come up to us, then
        let us go up, for the Lord hath delivered them into our hands.
    11 This shall be a sign to us.       So they both went to Messab of the
        Philistines ;  and the Philistines said, Behold the Hebrews are
    12 coming out of the holes where they hid themselves.               And the
        men of Messab, addressing Jonathan, and his armour bearer,
        said, Come up to us, and we will let you know something.
        Upon which Jonathan said to his armour bearer, Come up after
        me; for the Lord hath delivered them into the hands of Is-
    13 rael.   So Jonathan clambered up upon his hands and feet, and
        his armour bearer with him ; and they turned back at the sight
        of Jonathan, and he smote them; and his armour bearer be-
    14 hind him, supplied him.        Now the first slaughter which Jona-
        than, with his armour bearer made, was about twenty men,
             Ch. XIY.                               I.    KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
                    with darts, and sling stones, and pebbles picked up from the
             15 ground.               And there was a consternation in the camp, and in
                    the field;           and all the people who were in Messab, and they
                   who were spoiling, were struck with horror, and would not do
                    any thing ; for the earth trembled, and the consternation was
             16 from the Lord.                       And the watchmen of Saul, atGabaa of Ben-
                   jamin, looked, and behold the camp was in confusion from
             17 one side to the other.                               Whereupon Saul said to the people
                    who were with him, Examine I pray you, and see who is
                    gone from us.                    And when they examined, behold Jonathan
             18 and his armour bearer were not to be found.                                                    Then Saul said
                    to Achia, Bring the ephod.                                 For he at that time wore the
              19 ephod before Israel.                         But while Saul was speaking to the priest,
                    the noise in the camp of the Philistines continued, and grew
                    louder and louder ; whereupon Saul said to the priest, Bring
             20 together thy hands.                            And Saul went up, and all the people
                    with him, and came to the battle, and behold every man's
                    sword was against his fellow, and the confusion was very
             21 great.             And the slaves, who had heretofore been with the Phi-
                    listines, who had come up to the camp, even they turned, and
              22 joined the Israelites, who were with Saul and Jonathan.                                                              And
                    all the Israelites, who had hid themselves in mount Ephraim,
                    when they heard that the Philistines were fleeing, collected to-
              23 gether, and went after them to battle.                                          So the Lord saved Isra-
                    el that day ;             and the battle passed through the Bamoth, and all
                    the people with Saul were about ten thousand men ; and the
              24 battle spread to every city on mount Ephraim.                                                       But Saul was
                     guilty of a great imprudence that day ; for he uttered an im-
                     precation to the people, saying, Cursed be the man who eat-
                     eth bread till evening, that I may take vengeance on mine ene-
                     my ; so that none of the people tasted bread, though all the
              25 country was dining.                              Nay, though the forest Jaal abounded
                     with honey, on the face of the ground, and the people entered
              26 that apiary                     yet behold they went on talking, and behold
                                            ;
                     there was not one who put his hand to his mouth ; for the
              27 people feared the oath of the Lord.                                        But Jonathan did not hear
                     when his father                     adjured the people, therefore he stretched
                     forth the end of the sceptre in his hand, and stuck it into a ho-
                     ney ;comb, and when he put his hand to his mouth, his eyes
     Oh. XIY.               I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
     28 brightened up.      And one of the people addressing him said,
         Thy father solemnly adjured the people saying, Cursed be the
         man who eateth bread this day, so the people are become faint.
     29 And when Jonathan knew this he said, My father hath trou-
         bled the land.    See how my eyes have sparkled, because I tast-
     30 ed a little of this honey.    Consequently, had the people this day
         eaten freely of the spoils of the enemy, the slaughter among
         the Philistines would now have been much greater.
     31      They had now smitten on that day those of the Philistines
         at Machmas, and as the people were very fainty, they turned
     32 upon the spoils ; and when they took sheep, or cattle, or calves,
         they slew them on the ground, and eat them with the blood.
     33 And when it was told Saul, saying, The people have sinned
         against the Lord by eating with the blood, Saul said, Ye of
     34 Gethaim, roll for me here a great stone.          Then Saul said, Dis-
         perse yourselves among the people, and order them to bring
         here every man his ox, and every one his sheep, and kill it on
         this stone, and do not sin against the Lord by eating with the
         blood.   So the people brought every one, what he had at hand
     35 and they slaughtered them there. And Saul built an altar there
         to the Lord.    This was the first altar which Saul built to the
     36 Lord.    Then Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines this
         night, and make devastation among them till the morning light,
         and not leave a man among them.            And they said, Do what is
         good in thy sight.     But the priest said, Let us draw near hither
     37 to God.      Whereupon Saul consulted God, Shall I go down
         after the Philistines ?   Wilt thou deliver them into the hands of
     38 Israel ?    But he answered him not that day.           Then Saul said,
         Present here all the chiefs of Israel, and know and see by whom
      39 this sin hath been done this day ; for as the Lord liveth who
         hath saved Israel, if the answer be given against Jonathan my
         son, he shall surely be put to death.      But there was not one of
      40 the people who answered.        Then he said to all the men of Is-
          rael, You shall be one lot, and I and my son Jonathan shall be
          the other lot.   And the people said to Saul, Do what seemeth
      41 good in thy sight.     Then Saul said,       Lord the God of Israel,
          why hast thou not answered thy servant this day ?          If the fault
          be in me, or in Jonathan my son,          Lord God of Israel make
          us manifest.    And when he said these words, Give I beseech
                                                                                                                    ;

                thee to thy people Israel, Give I beseech thee Sanctity, the lot
           42 fell on Jonathan and Saul ; and the people escaped.                                    Then Saul
                said, Cast the lot between me, and Jonathan my son, and against
                whomsoever the Lord shall decide by lot, let him be put to
                death.        But the people said to Saul, This is not confirmed.
                But Saul prevailed over the people, so they cast the lot between
           43 him and his son Jonathan ; and the lot fell on Jonathan. There-
                upon Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me ; what hast thou done ?
                And when Jonathan told him, and said, I just tasted a little
                honey with the end of the sceptre which was in my hand, and
           44 behold I must die ; Saul said to him, God do so to me, and
           45 more also, but thou shalt surely die this day.                                   Upon this the
                people said to Saul, Shall he this day be put to death who hath
                wrought this great salvation in Israel ?                       xls the Lord liveth there
                shall not a hair of his head fall to the ground.                           Because the peo-
                ple of God had that day performed exploits, therefore the peo-
                ple prayed for Jonathan that day, and he did not die. Then
           47 Saul went up from following the Philistines ; and the Philistines
                went to their place.
                     Now Saul cast losts for the administration of government.
                Every work over Israel was determined by lot.                                  And he made
                war on all his enemies round about, on Moab, and on the chil-
                dren of Ammon, and the children of Edom, and on Baithaior,
                and on the king of Suba, and on the Philistines, and whither-
          48 soever he turned he was saved.                           He formed also an army and
                smote Amelek, and delivered Israel out of the hand of those
          49 who had trampled on them.                            Now the sons of Saul were Jona-
                than, and Jessiou, and Melchisa, and these were the names of
                his two daughters.                The name of his first born was Merob, and
          50 the name of his second Melchol.                              And the name of his wife
           51 was Achinoam.                She was the daughter of Achimaas.                            And the
                name of his captain general was Abenner.                               He was the son of
                Ner, Saul's uncle ; for Kis the father of Saul, and Ner the fa-
                ther of Abenner, were sons of Jamin, son of Abiel.
           52        Now there was a fierce war with the Philistines all the days
                of Saul.        And when Saul had assembled to him every man of
           XV.           valour, and every man whom he saw expert in war, Samuel
                said to Saul, the Lord sent me to anoint thee king over Israel
            2 now therefore hearken to the voice of the Lord. Thus saith the
                                                                                                               ;
       Ch. XV.                          I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
            Lord of Sabbaoth, Now will I take vengeance on Amelek, for
             the things which he did to Israel when he opposed them in the
         3 way, as they were coming up out of Egypt.                                      Now therefore
             go, and smite Amelek, and Jerim, and all that belong to him.
             Thou shalt not spare one of him but utterly destroy him.                                    Hav-
             ing devoted him and all belonging to him to destruction, thou
             shalt spare none, but shalt slay man and woman, infant and
         4 suckling, herds and flocks, camels and asses.                                Thereupon Saul
            assembled the people, and reviewedtthem at Galgal, four hun-
            dred thousand men of array, particularly of Juda thirty thou-
         5 sand men of array.               And when Saul came to the cities of Ame-
         6 lek, he laid an ambush in the valley.                        And Saul said to the Kin-
            ites, Away, remove from among the Amelekites.                                     I must not
            join you with them, for you dealt kindly with the Israelites
            when they were coming up out of Egypt.                                And when the Kin-
            ites had removed from among the Amelekites, Saul smote
         7 Amelek from Evilat to Sur in front of Egypt ; and took Agag
         8 the king of Amelek alive.                     When he had slain all the people
            and Jerim with the edge of the sword, Saul and all the people
            saved Agag alive, and spared the best of the flocks, and the
         9 herds, and provisions, and vineyards, and all that was good
            and would not destroy them, but destroyed only what was of
       10 no estimation or of little value.                       Wherefore a word of the Lord
       11 came to Samuel saying, Have I had comfort for making Saul
            king?        For he hath turned away from following me, and hath
            not observed my orders.                    Thereupon Samuel was grieved, and
       12 cried to the Lord that whole night.                              And Samuel arose early,
            and went to meet Israel in the morning.                           Now it had been told
            Saul, that Samuel had gone to Karmel and erected a hand for
            himself.        But he turned his chariot, and went down to Galgal
            to Saul, and behold he was offering up as a whole burnt offer-
            ing to the Lord the prime of the spoils which he had brought
       13 out of Amelek.               And when Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to
            him, Blessed art thou of the Lord.                           I have performed all that
       14 the Lord hath spoken.                       Whereupon Samuel said, But what
             bleating of flocks is this in my ears ? and what is this lowing of
       15 cattle which I hear? And Saul said, I have brought out of Ame-
             lek such as the people spared, the best of the flocks, and the
            herds, that they may be sacrificed to the Lord thy God; but
            XV.              I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
       Ch.
       16 the rest I have utterly destroyed.       And Samuel said, Permit
           me to tell thee what the lord said to me last night.        And he
       17 said to him, Speak.    Then Samuel said to Saul, Wast thou not
           in his sight a little leader of a family of a tribe of Israel ? yet
       IS the Lord anointed thee to be king over Israel ; and the Lord
           sent thee on a journey, and said to thee, Go and destroy utterly.
           Thou shalt slay those who have sinned against me; namely
           Amelek; and thou shalt fight against them until thou hast to-
       19 tally destroyed them.      Whythen didst thou not hearken to the
          voice of the Lord, but rush upon the spoil, and do evil in the
       20 sight of the Lord ?    And Saul said to Samuel, Because I heark-
          ened to the voice of the people.    But I have gone the way which
          the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag king of Amelek,
          and utterly destroyed Amelek, and the people have taken of
       21 the spoils, flocks and herds, as first fruits of the destruction,
       22 to sacrifice them before the Lord our God, at Galgal.           And
          Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in whole burnt
          offerings, and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord?
          Behold obedience is better than good sacrifice ; and to heark-
       23 en, is better than the fat of rams.     Because divination is a sin,
          the consulting Theraphin bringeth sorrow and distress : because
          thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, therefore the Lord
       24 hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.          Then Saul
          said to Samuel, I have sinned ; for I have transgressed the
          word of the Lord, and thy orders, because I feared the people
       25 and hearkened to their voice.       Now therefore bear away my
          sin, I beseech thee, and return with me that I may worship
       26 the Lord thy God.      And Samuel said to Saul, I cannot return
           with thee.   Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord,
          therefore the Lord will reject thee from being king over Israel.
       27 And when Samuel turned his face to go away, Saul took hold
       28 of the skirt of his mantle, and rent it.    Thereupon Samuel said
           to him, The Lord hath rent thy regal government from Israel,
           this day, out of thy hand, and will give it to a neighbour of thine,
       29 who is better than thou, and Israel shall be rent in twain.       He
           will not change, nor alter his mind, for he is not a man, that he
       30 should change his mind.      Then Saul said, I have sinned ; but
           honour me, I beseech thee, in the presence of the elders of Is-
           rael, and before my people, and return up with me, that I may
                                                                                                                                                                           ;
           Ch. XVI.                                         I.     KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
           31 worship the Lord thy God.                                                  So Samuel returned up after Saul,
                   and when he had worshipped the Lord, Samuel said, Bring be-
           32 fore me Agag the king of Amelek.                                                                     And when Agag came
                   before him, trembling, Agag said, Ah ! how bitter is death !
           .">:5   Whereupon Samuel said to Agag, As thy sword hath made
                   women childless, so shall thy mother be made childless among
                   women.                 So Samuel slew Agag before the Lord at Galgal.
           34 Then Samuel went to Armathaim, and Saul went up to his
           35 house to Gabaa, and Samuel came no more to see Saul to the
                   day of his death.
                              Because Samuel mourned for Saul, and the Lord repented
           XVI.                   that he had made Saul king over Israel, therefore the
                   Lord said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul ?
                   As for me, I have rejected him from being king over Israel.
                   Fill thy horn with oil, and come, let me send thee to Jessai to
              2 Bethlehem ; for I have seen among his sons a king for me. And
                    Samuel said, How can I go ?                                                Saul will hear and will kill me.
                   And the Lord said, Take with thee a heifer from the kine,
              3 and thou shalt say, I come to sacrifice to the Lord ; and thou
                   shalt invite Jessai to the sacrifice, and I will let thee know
                   what thou shalt do, and thou shalt anoint him whom I point out
              4 to thee.                    So Samuel did all that the Lord spoke to him.                                                                         Now
                   when he came to Bethlehem, the elders of the city were sur-
              5 prised at meeting him, and said, Seer! Is thy coming peace-
                   able ?             And he said, It is peaceable.                                             I come to sacrifice to the
              6*    Lord.             Sanctify yourselves, and rejoice with me to-day.                                                                            And
                   when he was hallowing Jessai and his sons and inviting them
                   to the sacrifice, he beheld Eliab as they were coming in and
              7 said, Is not the Lord's anointed before him ?                                                                              But the Lord
                    said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, nor the height
                    of his stature, for I have rejected him : for God looketh not
                    superficially as man looketh ; for man looketh at the outward
              8 appearance, but God will look to the heart.                                                                      Then Jessai called
                    Aminadab, and he passed by before Samuel.                                                                              And when lie
              9 said God hath not chosen him, Jessai brought forward Sama
            10 but he said, Neither hath the Lord made choice of him.                                                                                             And
                    when Jessai had brought his seven sons before Samuel, Samuel
            11 said, The Lord hath not made a choice among these.                                                                                                Then
                    Samuel said to Jessai, Are these all thy children ?                                                                        And he said,
                             vol. I.                                                    3 P
        Ch. XVII.              I.KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
            There is still one more, the youngest.        Behold he is tend-
        12 ing the flock.    And Samuel said to Jessai, Send for him ; for
            we cannot sit down till he come.        So he sent for him.     Now
            he was of a ruddy complexion, with beautiful eyes, and comely
            in appearance to the Lord, and the Lord said to Samuel, Arise
        13 and anoint David, for he is good.        So Samuel took the horn
            of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers.        And a
            Spirit of the Lord came upon David, from that day forward.
        14 Then Samuel arose and went to Armathaim.             And the Spirit
            of the Lord departed from Saul ; and an evil spirit from the
        15 Lord tormented him.       Whereupon the servants of Saul said to
            him, Behold now an evil spirit from the Lord tormenteth thee.
        16 Pray let thy servants before thee give orders, and seek for
            our lord a man who is skilled in playing on a kynara.     Andwhen
            the evil spirit is upon thee, let him play on his kynara, and it
        17 will be good for thee and give thee ease.      And Saul said to his
            servants, Look out, I pray you, for a man who playeth well,
        18 and bring him to me.       Then one of his servants answered and
            said, Behold I have seen a son of Jessai the Bethlemite.       He is
            skilled in music, and is a man of understanding and a warrior,
            graceful in speech, and of a comely appearance, and the Lord is
        19 with him.     Thereupon Saul sent messengers to Jessai saying,
        20 Send to me thy son David who is with the flock.             So Jessai
            took a gomer of bread, and a skin of wine, and a kid of the
            goats, and sent them to Saul by the hand of his son David.
        21 And when David came to Saul, and stood before him, he loved
        22 him greatly, and made him his armour bearer.          And Saul sent
            to Jessai, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me ; for
        23 he hath found favour in my sight.      And whenever the evil spirit
            came upon Saul, David took his kynara, and played with his
            hand, and it composed Saul and gave him relief ; and the evil
            spirit departed from him.
        XVII.       Now the Philistines had assembled their armies for bat-
            tle, and having formed a junction at Sokchoth of Judea, they
          2 encamped between Sokchoth and Azeka-ephermen.                Where-
            upon Saul and the men of Israel assembled and encamped in
            the valley, and drew up in array for battle, over against the
          3 Philistines.  And while the Philistines stood on a mountain on
            the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side,
                                                                                                                        ;
       Ch. XVII.                          I.   KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
             with a vale between them, there came forth a mighty man
        4 from the line of the Philistines.                          His name was Goliath, of Geth.
         5 His height was four cubits and a span.                                  And he had a helmet
             on his head, and was clad with a breast plate of chain work
             and the weight of his breast plate was five thousand shekels.
         6 It was of brass and steel : and the greaves on his legs were of
         7 brass ; and he had a target of brass between his shoulders.                                            And
             the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam : and his javelin
         8 was six hundred shekels of iron.                             And his armour bearer walk-
             ed before him.              And he stood, and cried with a loud voice, to
            the line of Israel, and said to them, Why come ye out to array
             yourselves for battle against us ?                          Am not I a Philistine ; and
             you Hebrews the servants of Saul ?                               Chuse out for yourselves
         9 a man, and let him come down to me.                                And if he be able to fight
             with me, and kill me, we will be your slaves ; but if I prevail,
       10 and kill him, you shall be our slaves, and serve us.                                           Then the
            Philistine said, Behold I have now this day defied the army of
             Israel.       Give me a man that we may fight at single combat.
       11 When Saul, and all Israel, heard these words of the Philistine,
       32 they were dismayed, and greatly terrified.                                      Whereupon David
            said to Saul, Let not, I pray thee, the heart of my lord be dis-
       33 couraged, thy servant will go and fight this Philistine.                                                And
             Saul said to David, Thou canst not go against the Philistine
            to fight with him ; for thou art but a youth, and he is a warrior
       34 from his youth.                  And David said to Saul, Thy servant tended
             his father's flock.              And when there came a lion, or a bear, and
       35 took a sheep from the flock, I went out after him, and smote
             him, and rescued it out of his mouth.                             And if he rose up against
             me, I seized him by the throat, and smote, and killed him.
       36 Thy servant hath slain a lion and a bear ; and this uncircum-
             cised Philistine shall be like one of them.                                Shall I not 2:0 and
             smite him, and remove, this day, a reproach from Israel ?                                             For
             who is this uncircumcised, that he should defy the army of
       37 the living God ?                   The Lord who delivered me out of the paw
             of the lion, and out of the paw of the bearâ€”he will deliver me
             out of the hand of this uncircumcised Philistine.                                         Then Saul
       38 said to David, Go ; and the Lord be with thee.                                                And when
             Saul had clad David with a coat of mail, and put a helmet of
             brass on his head, and girded his sword on David over the
        Ch. XVII.             I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
        39 coat of mail, he essayed to walk about ouce or twice.           Then
            David said to Saul, I cannot go with these ; for I have not been
        40 accustomed to them.       So they took them off him.        Then he
            took his staff in his hand, and having chosen for himself five
            smooth stones, out of the brook, he put them in the shep-
            herd's scrip, which he kept for a purse, and with a sling in
        42 his hand, he went out to meet the manâ€”the Philistine.          When
            Goliath saw David, He despised him exceedingly ; for he was
            a mere youth, and was of a ruddy complexion with beautiful
        43 eyes.   And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that thou
            shoulclst come out against me with a stick, and with stones ?
        44 And David said, Nay, but worse than a dog.          Upon which the
           Philistine cursed David by his gods.      And when the Philistine
           said to David, Come hither to me, and I will give thy flesh to
        45 the birds of the air, and the beasts of the earth, David said to
           the Philistine, Thou comest against me with a sword, and a
           spear, and a shield, but I am coming to thee with the name of
           the Lord God of Sabbaoth, of the army of Israel, which thou
        46 hast, this day, defied.   And the Lord will deliver thee this day
           into my hand, and I will kill thee, and cut off thy head, and
           give thy carcass, and the carcasses of the army of the Philis-
           tines this day, to the birds of the air, and to the wild beasts of
        47 the earth ; that all the earth may know that there is a God in
           Israel; and that all this assembly may know that the Lord
           saveth not with a sword or a spear.    For the battle is the Lord's,
        48 and the Lord will deliver you into our hands.        Then the Phi-
        49 listine arose and went to meet David.      And David put his hand
           in the scrip, and took out a stone, and slinged it, and smote
           the Philistine on the forehead, and the stone pierced through
           the helmet, into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the
        51 ground.    And David ran, and stood upon him, and took his
        52 sword, and killed him, and cut off his head.         And when the
           Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled ; and
           the men of Israel, and Juda, arose, and shouted, and pursued
           them to the entrance of Geth, and to the gate of Ascalon.       And
           the wounded of the Philistines fell on the road to the gates, all
        53 the way to Geth, and even to Akkaron.        And when the men of
           Israel returned from pursuing the Philistines, they trampled
        54 down their camps.     And David took the head of the Philistine,
           and carried it to Jerusalem ; but his arms he laid up in his tent.
     Ch. XVIII. XIX.         I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
     XVIII.    6 Now when the choirs of women came out from all
        the cities of Israel to meet David, dancing to tympanums, and
      7 singing songs of triumph, accompanied with cymbals, and the
        women in responsive strains, said,
            Saul hath slain his thousands ;
            And David his ten thousands,
      8 the thing appeared evil in the eyes of Saul, because of this
        expression ; and he said, The ten thousands they have ascribed
     12 to David ; and to me they have ascribed thousands.            And
        Saul became afraid of David, and removed him from about
    13 his person, and made him a captain over a thousand, and he
    14 went out and came in before the people.       And David behaved
    15 wisely in all his ways, and the Lord was with him.       And when
        Saul saw with what great wisdom he conducted himself, he
     16 was afraid of him ; but all Israel and Juda loved David, be-
    20 cause he went out and came in before the people.         And Mel-
    21 chol, the daughter of Saul, fell in love with David.    When this
        was told Saul, it was well pleasing in his sight, and Saul said,
        I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him.       Now
    22 the hand of the Philistines was against Saul, therefore Saul
        gave orders to his servants, saying, Speak privately to David,
        and say, Behold the king is well pleased with thee ; and all his
        servants love thee, therefore thou must be the king's son in law.
    23 But when the servants of Saul rehearsed these words in the
        hearing of David, David said, Is it a light matter in your
        eyes to be son in law to a king ?     As for me, I am a man of
    24 humble condition, and not entitled to honour.           And when
        Saul's servants told him the words which David had spoken,
    25 Saul said, Thus shall you say to David, The king desireth no
        other dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be
        avenged of the king's enemies.      Now Saul thought to throw
    26 him into the hands of the Philistines.       When Saul's servants
        told David these words, the condition on which he was to be the
    27 king's son in law, pleased David.    Therefore he arose and went
        with his men, and smote among the Philistines a hundred men,
        and brought their foreskins, and contracted to be the king's
        son in law, and he gave him his daughter Melchol to wife.
     28     But when Saul saw that the Lord was with David, and that
    XIX. all Israel loved him, he still continued to fear David ; there-
        Ch. XIX.               I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
           fore Saul spoke to his son Jonathan, and all his servants, to kill
         2 David.    Now Jonathan, the son of Saul, loved David exceed-
           ingly ; therefore Jonathan told David, and said, Saul seeketh
         3 to kill thee, therefore be on thy guard till to-morrow morning,
           and hide thyself, and keep close, and I will go out, and stand
           near my father in the field where thou art, and speak to my fa-
           ther about thee, and see what may be the matter, and tell thee.
         4 So Jonathan spoke to his father in commendation of David,
           and said to him, Let not the king sin against thy servaut Da-
           vid ; for he hath not sinned against thee ; and his services are
         5 very good.    For he hath put his life in his hands, and smitten
           the Philistines, and the Lord hath wrought a great deliverance,
           and all Israel have seen and rejoiced.       Why then wilt thou sin
           against innocent blood by putting David to death without
         6 cause?    And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan, and
           swore, saying, As the Lord liveth, he shall not be put to death.
         7 Thereupon Jonathan called David, and told him all these
           words.    And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in
         8 his presence as heretofore : and as the war continued against
           Saul, David took courage and fought against the Philistines,
           and smote them with a very great slaughter, and they fled before
         9 him.    But the evil spirit from God came upon Saul when he
           was sitting in his house, with his spear in his hand, and while
           David's hands were engaged in playing, Saul sought to strike
        10 the spear into David ; but David darted from before him, and
        11 he struck the spear into the wall.        As David had withdrawn,
           and escaped, Saul sent messengers that night to David's house,
           to watch him, with an intent to put him to death in the morn-
           ing.    But Melchol, David's wife, told him, and said, Unless
           thou save thy life this night, to-morrow thou wilt be put to
        12 death.   Then Melchol let David out through a window, and
        13 he departed, and fled, and escaped.          And Melchol took the
           cenotaphs, and laid them on the bed, and placed a goat skin
        14 pillow for his head, and covered them with a mantle.          So when
           Saul sent messengers to take David, they said he was sick.
        15 Then Saul sent them for David, saying, Bring him to me on
        16 the bed, that I may put him to death.        And when the messen-
           gers came, behold ! There were the cenotaphs on the bed, and
        IT a goat skin pillow for his head.      Whereupon Saul said to Mel-
          XX.               I.  KINGS-I. SAMUEL.
     Oh.
         chol, Why hast thou thus deceived me, and sent away my
         enemy, so that he hath escaped?           And Melchol said to Saul,
     18 He said, Let me go, else I will put thee to death.             So David
         fled, and escaped, and went to Samuel, to Armathaim, and told
         him all that Saul had done to him.           And Samuel went with
     19 David, and they made their abode at Xavath in Rama.                  And
     20 when it was told Saul, saying, Behold David is at Xavath, in
         Rama, Saul sent messengers to take David.             But when they
         saw the assembly of the prophets, with Samuel, standing at
         the head of them, a Spirit of God came upon the messengers
     21 of Saul, and they prophesied.          When this was told Saul, he
         sent other messengers, and they also prophesied.             And when
         Saul sent a third set of messengers, and they also prophesied,
     22 he was exceedingly enraged, and went himself to Armathaim.
         And when he came to the well of Alo, which is at Sephi, he
         inquired, and said, Where are Samuel and David ?             And they
     23 said, Behold at Xavath, in Rama.          Thereupon he went thence
         to Xavath, in Rama, and a Spirit of God came upon him also,
         and he went on prophesying till he came to Xavath, in Rama.
     24 And having stripped off his upper garments, he prophesied
         before them, and lay uncovered that whole day, and the whole
         night.   For this cause they said, Is Saul also among the pro-
         phets ?
     XX.       And David fled from Xavath in Rama, and came to Jo-
         nathan, and said, What have I done ?         And what is my offence ?
         And wherein have I sinned in the sight of thy father, that he
      2 seeketh my life ? And Jonathan said to him, God forbid ! Thou
         must not die.    Behold my father can do nothing, great or small,
         without telling me.       Why then should he conceal from me
      3 such a thing as this ?      It is not so.  And David in reply to Jo-
         nathan, said, Thy father knoweth well, that I have found fa-
         vour in thy sight, therefore he said, Jonathan must not know
         this.   He will not consent.      But as the Lord liveth, and thy
         soul liveth, it is as I said.   There is but a step between me and
       4 death.    Then Jonathan said to David, What doth thy soul
       5 desire ?   And, What shall I do for thee ?         And David said to
         Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon.             As for me, I
         will not sit down to eat.     Thou shalt let me go, and I will hide
       6 myself in the field till evening.     And if thy father look and in-
              XX.                I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
         Ch.
             quire for me, thou shalt say, David earnestly intreated me,
             that he might run to Bethlehem, his city, because there is an
           7 annual sacrifice there, for the whole community.            If he say,
             Very well; there is peace for thy servant.          But if he answer
             thee sharply, be assured that this mischief is fully determined
           8 on by him.     Now thou must deal mercifully with thy servant,
             because thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the
             Lord with thee.     If indeed there be iniquity in thy servant, put
             me to death thyself.     Why shouldst thou in that case bring me
          9 to thy father ?    And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee.        For if
             I know certainly that this mischief is fully determined on by
             my father, to come upon thee, provided it be not against thy
         10 cities, I will tell thee.    Then David said to Jonathan, Who
         11 shall tell me, if thy father hath answered roughly?         Whereupon
             Jonathan said to David, Come and stay in the field.           So they
         12 both went out to the field.      Then Jonathan said to David, The
             Lord God of Israel knoweth, that I will, as occasion ofTereth,
             during the three days, sound my father, and whether good or
             ill be determined in respect to David, I will send thee word
         13 into this field.   God do so to Jonathan, and more also, if I do
             not disclose the evils against thee, and send thee away that
             thou mayst go in peace.      And the Lord be with thee as he hath
         14 been with my father, provided that while I am alive, thou deal
         15 kindly with me, and, when I die, thou withdraw not thy kind-
             ness from my house forever ; and with this further proviso,
             that when the Lord removeth the enemies of David, every one
             from the face of the earth, the family of Jonathan be not sought
             for by the house of David, may the Lord search out the ene-
         17 mies of David.      And Jonathan reyjeated again his oath to Da-
         18 vid, for he loved the soul of one who loved him.           Then Jona-
             than said, To-morrow is new moon, therefore thou shalt hide
             thyself, that thy seat may be vacant ; and when thou hast done
         19 so for three days, thou shalt watch an opportunity, and come
             to this place, where thou mayst conceal thyself on that busy
         20 day, and thou shalt sit near that Ergab.         And I will come on
             the third day, and throw darts, taking aim at this Amattari.
         21 And behold I will send a servant and say, Go, find me the dart.
             If I say to the servant, Here, the dart is from thee, even here,
             pick it up.   Come thou to me, for there is peace for thee.       And
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;
           Ch. XX.                                                           I.       KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
           22 the matter is over, as the Lord liveth.                                                                                                  But if I say to the lad,
                      Here, the dart is from thee Titere.                                                                                Go thou away, for the Lord
           23 hath sent thee away.                                                             Now touching the matter of which I and
                      thou have spoken, behold the Lord is wituess between me and
            24 thee forever.                                          So David hid himself in the field, and when the
           25 new moon came, the king came to the table to dine.                                                                                                                                                        And
                       when he had seated himself as heretofore, on the seat by the
                       wall, he faced Jonathan, and Abenner sat by Saul's side, but
            26 David's seat was vacant.                                                                      And on that day Saul said nothing,
                       for he thought it was accidentalâ€”that being unclean he had
            27 not purified himself.                                                              But on the morrow, the second day of
                      the moon, when David's seat was vacant, Saul said to his son
                      Jonathan, Why hath not the son of Jessai come to table yes-
            28 terday and to-day ?                                                          And Jonathan answered Saul and said to
            29 him, David earnestly entreated me, that he might go to his
                       city Bethlehem, and said, Let me go, I entreat thee, for we
                       have a sacrifice of our community in the city, and my bre-
                       thren have sent for me.                                                          Now therefore if I have found favour
                       in thy sight, let me, I pray thee, go down and see my brethren.
            30 For this cause he hath not come to the king's table.                                                                                                                                  Upon this
                       Saul was greatly enraged at Jonathan, and said to him, Thou
                        son of the perverse and rebellious !                                                                                          For do I not know that
                       thou art an accomplice of the son of Jessai, to thy own shame,
            31 and the confusion of thy mother ?                                                                                                 For as long as the son of
                        Jessai liveth, thy kingdom will not be established.                                                                                                                        Now there-
                       fore send and seize that young man, for he shall surely die.
             32 And when Jonathan in reply said to Saul, Why must he die ?
             33 What hath he done ?                                                               Saul lifted up his spear against Jonathan,
                        to put him to death. So Jonathan knew that his father was fully
             34 bent on this mischief, to slay David, and started up from the
                        table in great wrath, and did not eat bread the second day
                        of the moon : for he was grieved for David, because his father
             35 was determinedly set against him.                                                                                               And when it was morning
                        Jonathan went out to the field, as he had fixed by appoint-
             36 ment with David, and a little boy with him.                                                                                                                         And he said to
                        the lad, Kun, find for me the dart which I threw.                                                                                                                        And as the
                        boy was running, he threw a dart, and it passed the other
             37 and when the boy came to the place where the dart lay which
                         Jonathan had thrown, Jonathan cried with a loud voice after
                                    vol. i.                                                                               :'>    <  >
                                                                                                                                   v

                  the boy, and said, There : the dart is from thee, even There.
            38 Then Jonathan cried with a loud voice after the boy, saying,
                  Haste with all speed.                   Tarry not.           So when Jonathan's servant
            39 had picked np the darts, and brought them to his master (Now
                  the boy knew nothing, Jonathan and David only understood
            40 the matter) Jonathan gave his weapons to the servant, and said
            41 to him, Go, return to the city.                                  And when the servant was
                  gone, David arose from the Argab, and fell on his face, and
                  made obeisance to him three times.                               And when they had kiss-
            42 ed each other, and wept over each other a great while, Jona-
                  than said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have both
                  sworn by the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord be a wit-
                  ness between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed,
                  forever.        Then David arose and departed, and Jonathan re-
                  turned to the city.
            XXI.             Now when David came to Nomba, to Abimelech the
                  priest, Abimelech was astonished at meeting him, and said to
              2 him, Why art thou alone, and nobody with thee ?                                              Thereupon
                  David said to the priest, The king hath given me to-day a bu-
                  siness in charge, and said to me, Let none know the business
                  on which I send thee, and with which I have charged thee
                  therefore I appointed my servants to meet me at the place call-
              3 ed Faith of God Phellani Maemoni.                                    Now therefore hast thou
              4 fives loaves at hand ?                   Give me what thou hast ready.                           And the
                  priest in reply said to David, I haye no common bread at hand.
                  Because there is none but the holy bread ; if thy servants have
              5 but kept themselves from women they may eat it.                                                 And Da-
                  vid in answer to the priest, said to him, Of a truth we have
                  kept ourselves from women these three days.                                        When I set out
                 on the journey, all the servants were purified (though the jour-
                  ney was on secular affairs) because they were to be holy
              6 this       day, on account of my provision for it.                                           So Abime-
                  lech the priest gave him the presence loaves, because he
                  had no other, but only those loaves which were taken from the
                  presence of the Lord, that fresh bread might be put in their
              7 place on the day he took them.                            Now there was there that day,
                  near the Neessaran before the Lord, one of Saul's servants.
              8 His name was Doek, the Syrian, who tended Saul's asses.
                  Then David said to Abimelech, See if there be at hand a spear
          XXII.             I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
     Ch.
         or a sword, for I did not bring my sword, nor my arms with
      9 me, because the king's business required haste.                 And the
         priest said, Behold here is the sword of Goliath, the Philistine,
         whom thou didst slay in the valley of Ela.           It is wrapped up
         in a garment.     If thou wilt take that, take it ; for there is no
     10 other besides that here.        And David said, There is none like
         it, give it me.   And when he had given it to him, David arose,
     11 and fled that day from the presence of Saul.          xVnd when David
         came to Angchus, king of Geth, the servants of Angchus said
         to him, Is not this David the king of the land ?            Was it not
         of him the choirs of women sung their responsive song say-
         ing, Saul hath slain his thousandsâ€”And David his ten thou-
     12 sands.    And David treasured up these words in his mind, and
     13 was greatly afraid of Angchus king of Geth, therefore he
         changed his countenance before him, and personated a cha-
         racter on that day, and beat as on a tympanum on the city
         gates, and scrabbled with his hands, and fell against the doors
     14 of the gate, and let his spittle run down on his beard.            There-
         upon Angchus said to his servants, Behold, you see the man
     15 is epileptic !    Why have you brought him to me ?              Am I in
         want of epileptics, that you should bring him to be taken with
         a fit before me ?   He shall not enter my house.
     XXII.       Then David departed thence, and having escaped, lie
      2 went to the cave Odollam.          And when his brethren, and the
         house of his father heard it, they went down to liim there.
         And every one who was in distress, and every one in debt,
        and every one aggrieved in mind, collected to him, and he
      3 was their leader.     So there were with him about four hundred
        men.    And from that place David went to Massephath of Moab,
        and said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother,
         I pray thee, be with thee, till I know what God will do for me.
      4 So he conciliated the favour of the king of Moab, and they
         dwelt with him all the time that David was at that fortress.
      5    And Gad the prophet said to David, Abide not in this for-
         tress ; depart and go to the land of Judea.          Thereupon David
         set out, and came and took up his abode in the city Sarick.
      6 When Saul heard that David and his men who were with him
         shewed themseh~es, (Xow Saul had seated himself on the emi-
         nence below the cultivated ground at Kama, with his spear in
       Ch. XXII.              I. KINGSâ€”T. SAMUEL.
        7 liis hand, and all bis servants stood around him) Saul said to his
           servants who attended him, Hearken, I pray you, ye sons of
           Benjamin ! Can the son of Jessai really give every one of you
           fields, and vineyards, and make you all captains of hundreds,
        8 and captains of thousands, that you all conspire against me ; and
           there is not one who informed me when my son made a league
           with the son of Jessai ; nor one of you who is sorry for me, or
           informeth me that my son hath stirred up my vassal against me
        9 to be my enemy, as is now the case ?        Then Doek the Syrian,
           who had the care of Saul's asses, answered and said, I saw the
           son of Jessai coming to Nornba, to Abimelech the son of Achi-
       10 tob, the priest ; and he inquired of God for him, and gave him
       11 victuals.   He gave him also the sword of Goliath.        Upon this
           the king sent for Abimelech, son of Achitob, and all his father's
       12 sons, the priests at Xomba ; and when they all came to the king,
           Saul said, Hear now thou son of Achitob !       And he said, Here
       13 I am.    Speak, my lord.      Then Saul said to him, Why hast
           thou conspired against me, thou and the son of Jessai, that thou
           shouldst give him bread, and a sword, and consult God for him
       14 to make him my enemy, as is now the case ?          And Abimelech
           answered the king and said, Who among all thy servants was
           like David, in high trust, and the king's son in law, and thy
       15 prime minister, and highly honoured in thy house ?       Have I now
           begun to consult God for him ?     Xo.   Let not the king bring a
           charge against his servant, and against all my father's house.
           For thy servant knew nothing of all these things, less or more.
       16 Then Saul the king said, Thou shalt surely be put to death,
       17 both thou Abimelech, and all the house of thy father.       And the
           king said to the light infantry who stood before him, Go near
           and put to death the priests of the Lord, because their hand was
           with David ; and because they knew that he was fleeing, and
           did not inform me.    And when the servants of the king refused
        18 to lift their hands against the priests of the Lord, the king said
           to Doek, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.           Thereupon
           Doek, the Syrian, turned and slew the priests of the Lord that
        19 clay, three hundred and five men, all wearing an ephod.        Then
           he smote Xomba the city of the priests, with the edge of the
           sword, both men and women, infant and suckling, with the
        20 cattle, and the asses, and the sheep.      But one son of Abime-
     Ch. XXIII.               I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
        lech, son of Achitob, escaped.    His name was AL>iathar, and he
        fled to David.   And when Abiathar told David that Sanl had
        slain all the priests of the Lord, David said to Abiathar, I
        might have known that dayâ€”that Doek the Syrianâ€”that he
        would tell Saulâ€”I am answerable for the lives of thy father's
    23 household.     Stay with me.    Fear not.   For wherever I provide
        a place for my own safety, I will provide also for thy safety ;
        for thou hast been preserved to be with me.
     XXIII.       Now when it was told David, saying, Behold the Phi-
        listines are making war on Keila : They are ravaging, and de-
      2 stroying the threshing floors, David inquired of the Lord say-
        ing, Shall I go and smite the Philistines ?      And the Lord said,
        Go, and thou shalt make a slaughter among the Philistines and
      3 save Keila.    But David's men said to him, Behold we are in
        terror here in Judea ; and how must it be if we go to Keila ?
      4 Shall we go to be a prey to the Philistines ?       Then David in-
        quired again of the Lord, and the Lord answered him, and said
        to him, Arise and go down to Keila ; for I will deliver the Phi-
      5 listines into thy hands.   So David went with his men to Keila,
        and fought the Philistines and they fled before him, and he took
        their cattle, and made a great slaughter among them.        So David
      6 saved the inhabitants of Keila.      Now as Abiathar, son of Abi-
        melech, had fled to David, he went down with him to Keila,
      7 having the ephocl in his hand.      And when Saul was told that
        David was come to Keila, Saul said, God hath sold him into
        my hands ; for he is shut up by coming into a city with gates
      8 and bars.    So Saul gave orders to all the people to go down for
      9 battle, to Keila, to take David and his men.      And David knew
         it ;for Saul did not conceal his mischievous intention respect-
         ing him.    Therefore David said to Abiathar the priest, Bring
     10 here the ephod of the^ Lord.        And David said,        Lord God
         of Israel, thy servant hath heard that Saul seeketh to come
     11 against Keila to destroy the city on my account.          Will it be
         shut up ?   Or will Saul come down now as thy servant hath
     13 heard ?       Lord God of Israel tell thy servant.     And the Lord
         said, It will be shut up.   Thereupon David arose, and his men
         with him, about three hundred, and departed out of Keila, and
         went wherever they could go.        And when Saul was told that
     14 David had escaped Jrom Keila, he forbore going.             So David
       Ch. XXIII.                 I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
           halted at Maserem, in the wilderness, at the straits, and fixed
           himself in the wilderness on mount Ziph, in that parched land.
           Though Saul continually sought David, yet the Lord did not
        15 deliver him into his hands.     Even when David saw that Saul
           was coming to seek him, when he was on the desert moun-
        16 tain in Kaina Ziph, Jonathan son of Saul arose, and went to
           David at Kaina, and strengthened his confidence in the Lord,
        17 and said to him, Fear not ; for the hand of my father Saul cannot
           find thee ; so that thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be
           second to thee, and Saul my father knoweth that this will be
        18 the case.  So they two made a covenant before the Lord, and
           David abode at Kaina, and Jonathan returned to his house.
       19 Then the Ziphites went up from the wilderness to Saul, on the
           mount, and said, Behold doth not David hide himself near us
           at Messara, at the straits by Kaina, on mount Echala, which is
       20 to the right of Jessamon ?      Now therefore every thing answer-
           eth the king's desire to induce him to come down.       Come down
       21 to us.   He is shut into the king's hands.     Thereupon Saul said
           to them, Blessed are you of the Lord ; for you have cared for
       22 me.    Go, I pray you, and make ready, and examine his haunt,
           whether there be any trace of him there lately, where you men-
       23 tioned.   Perhaps he will practise wiles.   Take a view therefore,
           and know, and I will go down with you, and if he be in that
           country I will search him out among all the thousands of Juda.
       24 So the Ziphites arose and went before Saul.         Now David and
           his men were in the wilderness of Maon, westward, on the right
       25 of Jessamon.    And when Saul with his men went to seek him,
           and David was told, he went down to the rock which is in the
           wilderness of Maon ; and when Saul heard, he pursued after
       26 David to the wilderness of Maon.           And Saul and his men
           marched on one side of the mountain, while David and his
           men were on the other side of the mountain.         But David was
           protected in escaping from the presence of Saul.         For while
       27 Saul and his men were encamping against David and his men,
           to take them, a messenger came to Saul, and said, Haste and
       28 come ; for the Philistines have invaded the land.        Whereupon
           Saul returned from pursuing David, and went to meet the Phi-
           listines. For this cause that place was called, The dividing
       29 rock.   Then David removed from that place, and took up his
           abode at the straits of Engaddi.
     Ch. XXIV.                 I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
     XXIV.        And when Sanl returned from pursuing the Philis-
         tines, and was told by men, saying, David is in the wilderness
      2 of Engaddi, he took with him three thousand men, selected
         out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men in front
      3 of Saddaiem.      And when he came to the sheepcots by the way
        side, where there was a cave, Saul went into it to prepare him-
        self.  Xow David and his men had taken up their abode in the
      4 inner part of the cave.       So David's men said to him, Behold
        this is the day, which the Lord mentioned to thee, that he
        would deliver thine enemy into thy hands, that thou mayst do
        to him what seemeth good in thine eyes.             Then David arose,
      5 and cut off the skirt of Saul's cloak privily.           And after this
        David's heart smote him, because he had cut off the skirt of
      6 Saul's cloak.     And David said to his men, The Lord forbid
        that I should do this thing to my lord, the anointed of the Lord,
        to lift up my hand against him ; for he is the Lord's anointed.
      7 So David prevailed on his men by these words, and did not
      8 permit them to rise, and kill Saul.         And when Saul arose and
        went on his way, David went after him out of the cave.               And
        David cried with a loud voice after Saul, and said, My lord,
            king !   And when Saul looked about behind him, David
        bowed down, with his face to the ground, and made obeisance
      9 to him.    Then David said to Saul, Why dost thou hearken to
         the words of the people who say, Behold David seeketh thy
     10 life ?  Behold this very day thine eyes have seen, how the Lord
         delivered thee to-day into my hands, in the cave, and I would
        not kill thee, but spared thee, and said, I will not lift up my
     11 hand against my lord, because he is the Lord's anointed.            Now
         behold here is the skirt of thy cloak in my hand.         I cut off the
         skirt, but did not kill thee.    Know, therefore, and see now that
         there is no wickedness in my handâ€”no impiety or disloyalty ;
         nor have I sinned against thee, though thou huntest my life to
     12 take it.   TheLord judge between me and thee.            And the Lord
     13 avenge thee on thyself.      Let not my hand be upon thee.            Ac-
         cording to the old proverb, From the wicked will proceed
     14 transgression.    So let not my hand be upon thee.             And now,
         after whom art thou coming out,               king of Israel?       And
         after whom art thou in pursuit ?       After a dead dog ?      Or after
     15 a flea ?    The Lord be a judge, and a discerner of right, be-
                                                                                  â€”;
             XXV.                I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
        Ck.
            tween me and thee.       May the Lord see, and judge my cause,
        16 and deliver me out of thy hand !        And when David had finish-
            ed speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, Is this thy voice,
        17 my son David ?       And Saul raised his voice, and wept.          Then
            Saul said to David, Thou art more righteous than I ; for thou
        18 hast returned me good ; but 1 have returned thee evil.             Thou
            hast indeed proved to me this day the good thou hast done
            me ;  as the Lord delivered me this day into thy hands, and
        19 thou hast not slain me.      Now, because if any man find his ene-
            my in distress, and send him away well, the Lord will reward
        20 him with good, therefore now behold I know that thou shalt
            surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be esta-
        21 blished in thy hand.          Now therefore swear to me by the
            Lord, that thou wilt not destroy my seed after me ; nor blot
        22 out my name from the house of my father.               So David swore
            to Saul, and Saul departed to his place, and David and his men
            went up to the straits of Messara.
        XXV.        Now when Samuel died all Israel assembled, and be-
            wailed him, and buried him at his house at Armathaim.              Then
         2 David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Maon.               Now
            there was a man at Maon whose flocks were at Carmel.                 He
            was a very wealthy man.       He had three thousand sheep, and a
         3 thousand goats, and he was sheering his sheep at Carmel.             The
            man's name was Xabal, and his wife's name was Abigaia.              His
            wife was a woman of good understanding, and very beautiful
            but the man was morose, and ill natured, and of a surly dispo-
          4 sition.   And when David heard in the wilderness that Nabal
          5 the Carmelite was sheering his flocks, David sent ten young
            men, and said to the young men, Go up to Carmel and when
            you come to Nabal, salute him in my name and say thus
          6 Health and prosperity to thee, and thy house, and to all that
          7 thou hast.    Now behold I have heard, that thy shepherds who
            were with us in the wilderness are now shearing.           We did not
            molest them, nor exact any thing of them all the time they
            were at Carmel.     Inquire of thy servants, and they will tell thee.
          8 Let thy servants therefore find favour in thy sight, for we are
            come in a good time.          Give, we pray thee, whatever thou
          9 canst conveniently to thy son David.        So the young men went
            aud delivered the message, in David's name, to Nabal : in
    Ch. XXV.              I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
    10 these very words.      Upon which Nabal started up, and in re-
        ply said to David's young men, Who is David ? and who is
        the son of Jessai ?   There are now a days many slaves who run
    11 away every one from his master; and shall I take my bread,
        and my wine, and the flesh I have killed for my sheep shear-
        ers, and give them- to men whom I know not whence they
    12 be?     At this David's young men turned about, and came
        away, and having returned, they came and told David these
        words, whereupon David said to his men, Gird on every man
     13 his sword.    So there went up with David about four hundred
    14 men, and two hundred staid with the baggage.              Now one of
        his servants had told Abigaia, the wife of Nabal, saying, Be-
        hold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to salute
     15 our master; but he turned away from them.            Now those men
        were very kind to us.      They never molested us, nor exacted
     16 any thing from us, all the time we were with them.         And when
        we were in the fields, they were like a wall around us night
        and day, all the time we were near them, tending the flock.
     17 Now therefore consider, and see what thou canst do : for there
        is mischief determined on against our master, and his house-
        hold; but he is so perverse that there is no speaking to him.
     IS Upon this Abigaia hasted, and took two hundred loaves, and
        two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five
        ephahs of barley meal, and a gomer of dried raisins, and two
     19 hundred fig cakes, and laid them on asses, and said to her ser-
        vants, Go on before me, and behold I will come after you : but
     20 she did not tell her husband.        And it happened, that as she,
         mounted xm her ass, was going down under the covert of the
        mountain, behold David and his men were coming down over
     21 against her ; so she met them.        Now David had said, Surely
         for an unrighteous fellow have I guarded all that he had in the
         wilderness, and we have not ordered the taking of any thing
     22 belonging to him : but he hath rewarded me evil for good.
         God do so to David, and more also, if by to-morrow morning
     23 I leave of all that belong to Nabal one manâ€”And when Abi-
         gaia saw David, she hasted, and alighted from her ass, and
         fell on her face before David, and made obeisance to him on
         the ground, at his feet, and said, On me, my lord, be my ini-
     24 quity.   Let thy servant, I beseech thee, speak in thine audience
             VOL. i.                    3 R
        Oh. XXV.             I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
        25 and hear the words of thy servant.       Let not my lord, I pray
            thee, set his heart against this perverse man.  For as is his name
            so is he. His name is Nabal, and with him is folly.      But I thy
            servant did not see my lord's servants whom thou didst send.
        26 Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth,
            as the Lord hath withheld thee from coming to shed innocent
            blood, it was to save thy hand for thyself.     Now therefore let
            all thine enemies and those who seek to hurt my lord be like
        27 Nabal.    And now accept this present, which thy servant hath
            brought for my lord, and give it to the young men who attend
        28 my lord.    Forgive, I beseech thee, what is amiss in thy servant.
            Because the Lord will assuredly make for my lord a faithful
            houseâ€”because the Lord will fight the battle of my lord, there-
        29 fore there must never be iniquity found in thee.     Though a man
           may rise up to pursue thee, and seek thy life, yet will the life
            of my lord be bound up in the bundle of life by the Lord
            God ; but the life of thy enemies thou shalt sling out with a
        30 sling.   And when the Lord shall do for my lord all the good
           things which he hath spoken concerning thee, and hath made
        31 thee ruler over Israel, thou my lord must not have the stain or
           guilt of having causelessly shed innocent blood.     May the Lord
           therefore save the hand of my lord for himself, and kindly dis-
           pose my lord, that thou mayst remember thy servant, to deal
        32 kindly by her.    Thereupon David said to Abigaia, Blessed be
           the Lord, the God of Israel, who hath sent thee this day to meet
        33 me. And blessed be thy conduct, and blessed thouwho hast kept
           me back from coming to blood, that I might save my hand for
        34 myself.   For as the Lord God of Israel liveth, who hath this
           day withheld me from doing thee an injury, if thou hadst not
           hastened, and come to meet me, I had determined that by the
           morning light there should not be left to Nabal one man.
        35     Then David received at her hand all that she brought him,
           and said to her, Go up in peace to thy house.          See, I have
        oft hearkened to thy voice from a personal regard to thee.       Then
           Abigaia went to Nabal, and behold he had an entertainment
           at his house like that; of a king, and Nabal's heart was elated
           for he was very drunk, so she told him nothing less or more
        37 till the next morning.     But in the morning when Nabal had
           recovered from his wine, his wife told him all these things.
     Ch. XXVI.             I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
         and his heart was confounded, and he became like a stone.
     38 And in about ten days the Lord smote Nabal, and he died.
     39 And when David heard it, he said, Blessed be the Lord who
         hath judged the cause of my reproach, out of the hand of Na-
         bal, and hath preserved his servant from the hand of wicked
         men.    The Lord hath turned the wickedness of Nabal on
         his  own head.       Then David sent and spoke of Abigaia
     40 to take her for a wife ; and when David's servants came
         to Abigaia to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying, David hath
     41 sent us to thee to take thee to himself for a wife, she arose,
         and bowed down to the ground on her face, and said, Behold
         thy servant is ready to be a house maid to wash the feet of thy
     42 servants.    Then Abigaia arose, and mounted her ass, and five
         maids accompanied her, and she went with David's servants,
     43 and became his wife.         Now David had taken Achinaam of
         Jezrael, and they were both his wives.          And Saul gave his
         daughter Melchol, David's wife, to Phalti, son of Amis, of
         Komma.
     XXVI.       Again the Zrphites came from the wilderness to Saul,
         on the mount, and said, Behold, David is lurking with us on
      2 mount Echela, in front of Jessemon.           Thereupon Saul arose,
         and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having with him
         three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek David in the
      3 wilderness of Ziph.      And Saul encamped on that eminence of
      4 Echela, which is in front of Jessemon, by the way side.            Now
         David made his abode in that wilderness.         So when David saw
         that Saul was coming after him, into the wilderness, he sent
         out spies.   And when he knew that Saul was come in force
      5 out of Keila, David arose privily, and went to the place where
         Saul was sleeping.       And Abenner, son of Ner, his captain
         general was there, and Saul was asleep in a palanquin, and the
      6 people were encamped around him.             Now David addressing
         Abimelech the Chettite, and Abessa son of Saruia, the brother
         of Joab, had said, Who will go with me into the camp to Saul ?
      7 and Abessa said, I will go with thee.           So David went with
         Abessa, in among the people by night, and behold Saul lay
         fast asleep in a palanquin, and his lance was stuck in the
         ground at his head, and Abenner and his people lay around him.
       8 Whereupon Abessa said to David, The Lord hath this day
                                                                                                                    ;
            Ch. XXVI.                       I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
                 delivered thine enemy into thy hands, now therefore let me
                 smite him with my spear, to the ground, at one stroke, and I will
             9 not repeat the blow.                    But David said to Abessa, Thou must
                 not humble him : for who can lift up his hand against the
            10 Lord's anointed, and be guiltless?                            Then David said, As the
                 Lord liveth, either the Lord will smite him, or his time shall
            11 come, and he will go down to battle and fall.                                   The Lord for-
                 bid that I should stretch forth my hand against the anointed of
                 the Lord.         Now therefore take, I pray thee, the spear from his
           12 pillow, and the cup of water, and let us go.                               So David took the
                 lance, and the cup of water from his pillow, and went away
                 and there was none who saw, nor was there one who perceived,
                 nor one who awaked.                  They were all fast asleep.                   For a deep
           13 sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them.                              And when David had
                passed over to the other side, he stood on the top of the moun-
           14 tain, at a distance, and there was a great way between them,
                 and David called to the people, and spoke to Abenner, saying,
           15 Wilt thou not answer, Abenner, !                            And Abenner answered and
                said, Who art thou, who callest ?                      Then David said to Abenner,
                Art thou not a chief man ? And who is like thee in Israel ? Why
                then dost thou not guard thy lord the king ?                                  For one of the
           16 people went in to slay thy lord the king.                                   This thing which
                 thou hast done is not good.                        As the Lord liveth, you who
                 guard your lord the kingâ€”the anointed of the Lord, are guilty
                 of death ; for see now, I pray thee, the king's lance, and the
            17 cup of water, where are they which were at his head?                                            And
                 when Saul knew David's voice, he said, Is this thy voice, my
                 son David?            And David said, I am thy servant, my lord the
           18 king.         Moreover he said, Why doth my lord pursue after his
                 servant ?        For wherein have I offended, or what iniquity is there
           19 found in me?                 Now therefore let my lord the king hear the
                 word of his servant.                If God stirreth thee up against me, let
                 thy sacrifice be fragrant : bat if the sons of men ; cursed be
                 they before the Lord; for they have now driven me out from
                 abiding securely in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go,
           20 serve other gods.                Now therefore, let not my blood fall on the
                land before the face of the Lord, because the king of Israel is
                come out to seek my life, as the night hawk pursueth on the
           21 mountains.             Then Saul said, I have sinned.                        Return, my son
                                            SAMUEL.
     Ch. XXVII.            I. KINGSâ€”I.
         David ; for I will no more do thee harm ; because my life hath
         been precious in thy sight, at the very time when I was led
     22 astray by folly, and egregiously mistaken.       And David answer-
         ed and said, Behold here is the king's lance ; let one of the
     23 young men come overand takeit. The Lord will render to every
         one according to his righteousness, and his fidelity.        As the
         Lord delivered thee this day into my hands, and I would not
     24 lay my hand on the Lord's anointed ; and behold as thy life
         was this day highly regarded in my eyes, so may my life be
         highly regarded in the sight of the Lord, and may he protect
     25 me !   He indeed will deliver me out of all affliction.   Then Saul
         said to David, Blessed art thou, my son.        Thou shalt surely
        perform exploits, and prevail.     Then David went his way, and
         Saul returned to his place.
     XXVII.       But David spoke in his heart, saying, I may one day
        fall into the hands of Saul.      Is it not best for me to make my
        escape to the land of the Philistines, so that Saul may cease
        from seeking me in the borders of Israel?          So shall I escape
      2 out of his hand.      So David arose, and the six hundred men
        with him, and went to xVngchus, son of Ammach, king of
      3 Geth.    And David abode with Angchus, both he and his men,
        every one with his household, and David with his two wives,
        Achinaam the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia late the wife of Nabal
      4 the Carmelite. And when Saul was informed that David had fled
         to Geth, he did not proceed any more to seek him.        Now David
      5 had said to Angchus, If thy servant hath found favour in thy
        sight, let a place, I pray thee, be given me in one of thy cities,
        in the country, and I will settle there.       For why should thy
      6 servant dwell in the royal city with thee ?      So he gave him on
        that day Sekelak; for this cause Sekelak belongeth to the
      7 king of Juda to this day. Now the time that David had dwelt in
      8 the country of the Philistines was four months, when David
        went up with his men, and they fell upon all the Geserites, and
        upon the Amelekites.        (Now this country was inhabited by
        wandering hordes, excepting those who had fixed abodes from
      9 Gelampsur to the land of Egypt.)       And when he smote the land
        he saved neither man nor woman alive ; but he took their
        flocks, and herds, and asses, and camels, and raiment, and re-
     10 turned, and came to Angchus.          And when Angchus said to
       Ch. XXVIII.           I. KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
           David, Upon whom have you fallen ?         David said to Angchus,
           Towards the south of Judea, and towards the south of Jesme-
       11 ga, and towards the south of Kenezi.       But I saved neither man
           nor woman to bring them to Geth, saying, They must not
           carry tidings against us to Geth; and say, Such and such things
           doth David.    And this was his custom all the time that David
       12 dwelt in the country of the Philistines.         And David was in
           high confidence with Angchus, who said, He is surely in great
           disgrace with his people in Israel, therefore he must be my
           servant forever.
       XXVIII.       Now in those days when the Philistines were as-
           sembling in their camps to go out to war with Israel, Angchus
           said to David, Know assuredly that thou shalt go out with me
        2 to battle, both thou and thy men.        Whereupon David said to
           Angchus, Thus thou shalt now know what thy servant can do.
           And Angchus said to David, Thus will I make thee captain of
        3 mybodyguard during thylife. Now Samuel was dead and all Is-
           rael had bewailed him, and buried him at Arniathaim in his city.
           And Saul had driven from the land the belly speakers, and the
        4 diviners; and the Philistines assembled, and came and encamp-
           ed at Sonam; whereupon Saul assembled all Israel, and they
         5 encamped at Gelbua.       And when Saul saw the camp of the
           Philistines he was afraid, and his heart was exceedingly dis-
         6 mayed.    And Saul inquired of the Lord ; but the Lord did not
           answer him ; neither by dreams, nor by manifestations, nor by
         7 prophets.   Then Saul said to his servants, Seek out for me a
           woman who is a belly speaker, and I will go to her and con-
         8 suit her.   And his servants said to him, Behold there is a wo-
           man, a belly speaker, at Endor.         Thereupon Saul disguised
           himself, and put on other clothes, and went, he and two men
           with him.    And they came to the woman by night, and said to
           her, Consult for me, I pray thee, the belly speaker, and bring
         9 up for me him whom I shall mention to thee.         And the woman
           said to him, Behold thou knowest what Saul hath done ; how
           he hath rooted out all the belly speakers, and the diviners, out
           of the land ; why then dost thou lay a trap for my life, to put
        10 me to death ?     And Saul swore to her saying, As the Lord liv-
        11 eth, there shall no mischief befal thee on this account.        Then
           the woman said, Whom shall I bring up for thee ?       And when he
        9
                               I.  KINGSâ€”I. SAMUEL.
      Ch. XXVIII.
      12 had said, Bring up Samuel for nie, the woman saw Samuel, and
          cried with a loud voice.          And the woman said to Saul, Why
      13 hast thou deceived me ?          Thou indeed art Saul.          And the king
          said to her, Fear not.        Tell me, Whom hast thou seen?                 And
          the woman said to him, I saw gods coming up out of the earth.
      14 And he said to her, What didst thou discover ?                   And she said
          to him, An erect man coming up out of the earth, and he had
          a mantle thrown around him.             So Saul knew that this was Sa-
          muel, and he bowed down on his face to the ground, and made
      15 obeisance to him.          And Samuel said, Why hast thou troubled
          me, that I should come up ?            And Saul said, I am in great af-
          fliction.   The Philistines are making war on me, and God hath
          departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by the
      16 agency of prophets, nor by dreams.              Now therefore I have called
          thee, to let me know what I shall do.               And Samuel said, Why
          dost thou ask me, seeing the Lord is departed from thee, and
      17 is with thy neighbour?            The Lord indeed hath done to thee as
          the Lord spoke by my agency.                And the Lord will rend the
           kingdom out of thy hand, and give it to thy neighbour, even
      18 to David.       Because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the
          Lord, and didst not execute the fierceness of his wrath on
          Amelek, therefore the Lord hath done this thing to thee this
      1   day.    And the Lord will deliver Israel with thee into the hands
          of the Philistines, and to-morrow thou, and thy sons with thee,
           shall fall, and the Lord will deliver the army of Israel into the
      20 hand of the Philistines.          At this Saul shuddered, and fell at his
           full length on the ground, and was struck with horror at the
           words of Samuel, and there was no more any strength in him,
           fur he had not eaten bread that whole day, and that whole
      21 ni^ht.      Then the woman came to Saul, and when she saw that
           he was in great trepidation, she said to him, Behold I pray
           thee, thy servant hath hearkened to thy voice.                 I put my life
           in my hand, and heard the words which thou didst speak to
      22 me; now therefore, hearken, I pray thee, to the voice of thy
           servant, and let me set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat
      23 that thou mayst have strength; for thou art to travel.                       And
           when he declined eating, his servants and the woman pressed
           him ; so he hearkened to their voice, and arose from the ground,
      24 and sat on a seat.          Now the woman had a fatted calf in the
                                                                                                                   ;

                 house, so she hasted, and slew it, and she took flour, and mix-
                 ed it, and baked unleavened cakes, and set them before Saul
           25 and his servants.                And when they had eaten, they arose and
                 departed that night,
           XXIX.            The Philistines had now assembled all their armies at
                 Aphek, and Israel were encamped at Endor which is in Jezrael.
             2 Now when the lords of the Philistines were on their march, at
                the head of their hundreds and thousands, and David and his
             3 men were marching in the rear with Angchus, the lords of the
                Philistines said, Who are these marching here ?                                 And Angchus
                said to the generals of the Philistines, Who, but David the ser-
                vant of Saul ?           He hath been long with us.                      This is the second
                year, and I have found no fault in him from the day he came to
             4 me to this day. But the generals of the Philistines were offended
                at him, and said to him, Send this man away and let him re-
                turn to his place where thou hast fixed him, and let him not
                go with us to battle, nor be let into the councils of the army.
                How can he reconcile himself to his master ?                                 Will it not be
             5 with the heads of these men ?                        Is not this the David of whom
                they sung the responsive song in choirs, saying, Saul hath slain
             (} Ids thousands, and David his ten thousands?                            Then Angchus call-
                ed David, and said to him. As the Lord liveth, Thou art good,
                and upright in my eyes, and so is thy going out and thy com-
                ing in with me in the army.                    Indeed I have not found any thing
                amiss in thee from the day of thy coming to me even to this
            7 day.        But thou art not in favour with the lords.                           Now therefore
                return, and go in peace, that thou mayst not give offence to
            8 the lords of the Philistines.                         And David said to Angchus,
                What have I done to thee, and what hast thou found in thy ser-
                vant ;from the day I came to thee to this day, that I may not go
            9 and fight the enemies of my lord the king ?                                 And Angchus re-
                plied to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, but the
                lords of the Philistines say, He shall not go with us to battle
           10 now therefore rise early to-morrow morning, thou and the ser-
                vants of thy lord who have come with thee, and go to the place
                where I have fixed thee, and harbour not an evil thought in thy
                heart ; for thou art good in my sight.                          Be up betimes for the
           11 march, and soon as you have light depart.                                    So David arose
                early, he and his men, to go and guard the land of the Philis-
                tines, while the Philistines went up to battle at Jezrael.
                                                                                                             ;

       Ch.
       XXX.             But when David and his men arrived at Sekelak, on
            the third day, Amelek had invaded the South, and Sekelak, and
            had smitten Sekelak.                Though they had burned it with fire,
        2 yet with regard to the women, and all who were in it, they
            had not slain a man, or a woman, small or great, but had taken
        3 them captive, and marched off.                        So when David and his men
            came to the city, and saw that it was burned with fire, and
            that their wives, and their sons, and their daughters were ta-
         4 ken captive, David and his men raised their voices, and wept
         5 till they had no more power to weep.                          Now both David's wives
            were taken captive ; both Achinaam the Jezraelitess, and Abi-
         6 gaia, the wife of Nabal, the Carmelite.                       And David was in great
            distress, for the people talked of stoning him ; for the soul of all
            the people was exasperated, every one for his sons, and his
            daughters.          David, however, was strengthened by the Lord
         7 his God.          And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of
         8 Abimelech, Bring hither the ephod.                            And David inquired of
             the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue this horde?                                Shall I over-
            take them ?           And he said to him, Pursue, for thou shalt over-
         ly  take them and without fail rescue.                         Then David set out, he
            and the six hundred men who were with him ; and when they
       10 came to the brook Bosor, the reserve halted.                                     He pursued
             with four hundred men, and two hundred, who halted on the
       11 bank of the brook Bosor, guarded the baggage.                                       And they
             found an Egyptian in the field, and took him, and brought
             him to David, and they gave him bread, and he ate, and they
        12 gave him water to drink.                    Then they gave him a piece of fio-
             cake, and when he had eaten, and his spirit was come to him
             for he had not tasted bread, nor drank water for three days and
        L3 three nights, David said to him, To whom dost thou belong,
             and whence art thou ?                And the Egyptian lad said, I am a ser-
        14 vant of a man, an Amelekite.                        My master left me because I
             fell sick three days ago.              We made an invasion on the south of
             the Chelethites, and on those parts of Judea, and on the south
        15 of Chelub, and we burned Sekelak with fire.                              Then David said
             to him, Wilt thou conduct me to this horde ?                         And he said, Swear
             to me now by God, that thou wilt not put me to death nor deli-
             ver me into the hands of my master, and I will conduct thee to
        16 the horde.           So lie conducted him thither, and behold they were

         Ch.
             spread abroad on the face of the whole land, eating and drinking,
             and celebrating a festival, for all the great spoil which they had
             taken from the country of the Philistines, and from the land
         17 of Judea.      And David came upon them, and smote them, from
             break of day till late in the evening, and part of the next day,
             so that not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young
        18 men, who mounted camels and fled.                  And David recovered
         19 all that the Amelekites had taken.           He recovered also his two
             wives.   There was none missing among them, small or great,
             nor any of the spoils, nor sons nor daughters, nor any thing
         20 of what they had taken.           David recovered all.       He took also
             all their flocks, and herds, and drove them before the spoils.
         21 And of this prey it was said, These are David's prey.                   And
             when David came to the two hundred that were left to follow
             David, and whom he had caused to halt by the brook Bosor,
             they came out to meet David, and to meet the people who
         22 were with him.       But when David introduced them to the peo-
             ple, and they had saluted them ; all the turbulent and bad men
             among the warriors, who went with David, answered and said,
             Because they did not accompany us in the pursuit we will not
             give them any of the spoils which we have taken, save that
             every one may take his wife and children.           Let them take these
         23 and depart.      But David said, You must not do so, since the
             Lord hath given them to us and preserved us.                The Lord in-
             deed hath delivered into our hands this wandering horde,
         24 which came against us, who then will hearken to your words?
             For these are not less entitled to them than we are.              For as is
             the share of him who goeth down to the battle, so shall be the
         25 share of him who guardeth the baggage.               They shall all share
             alike.   So from that day forward this was the rule, and it became
             a statute, and an established custom in Israel even to this day.
         26 And when David came to Sekelak, he sent some of the spoils
         27 to the elders of Juda, and to his friends, saying, Here are some
             of the spoils of the enemies of the Lord for those at Baithsur,
             and for those at South Bama, and for those at Gethor, and for
         28 those at Aroer, and for those at Ammadi, and for those at
             Saphi, and for those at Esthie, and for those at Geth, and for
         29 those at Kimath, and for those at Saphek, and for those at
             Themath, and for those at Carmel, and for those in the cities

     Ch.
     30 of Jeremeel, and for those in the cities of the Kenezites, and
        for those at Jerimuth, and for those at Bersabee, and for those
     31 at Noniba, and for those at Chebron, even all the places through
        which David and his men had passed.
     XXXI.       Now when the Philistines attacked Israel, the men of
        Israel fled before the Philistines, and the wounded fell on the
      2 mountain Gelbua, and the Philistines came to a close engage-
        ment with Saul and his sons, and the Philistines smote Jona-
      3 than, and Aminadab, and Melchisa, sons of Saul.       And the bat-
        tle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he
      4 was wounded in the hypochondres, whereupon Saul said to his
        armour bearer, Draw thy sword, and run me through with it,
        lest these uncircumcised come and stab me, and insult me.       But
        his armour bearer would not, for he was struck with horror.
      5 Therefore Saul took the sword, and fell on it.       And when his
        armour bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his
      6 sword, and died with him.     Thus Saul, and his three sons, and
        his armour bearer, died on the same day in the same place.
      7 And when the men of Israel who were on this side the vale,
        and they who were on the bank of the Jordan, saw that the
        men of Israel fled ; and that Saul and his sons were dead, they
        left their cities, and fled, and the Philistines came and dwelt
      8 therein.   Now on the morrow when the Philistines came to strip
        the dead, they found Saul, and his three sons, fallen on the
      9 mountains of Gelbua.      And they treated him scornfully, and
        stripped off his armour, and sent it to the land of the Philis-
         tines, proclaiming the good news all around to their idols, and
     10 to the people.    And they hung up his arms in the temple of
     11 Astarte, and fixed, up his body on the wall of Baithsam.        But
         when the inhabitants of Jabis Galaad heard what the Philistines
     12 had done to Saul, they arose, even all the men of valour, and
         marched the whole night, and took the body of Saul, and the
         body of Jonathan his son, from the wall of Baithsam, and car-
     lo ried them to Jabis and there burned them.          Then they took
         their bones, and buried them in the field at Jabis, and fasted
         seven days.
       Ch. I.               II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
       I.      Now after the death of Saul when David returned from
        2 the slaughter of the Amelekites, and had been at Sekelak two
          days, behold there came a man, on the third day, from the
          campâ€”from the people of Saul with his clothes rent, and earth
          on his head, and when he came to David he fell on the ground,
        o and made obeisance to him.        And David said to him, Whence
          comest thou?      And he replied, I have escaped from the camp
        4 of Israel.   Thereupon David said to him, What is the news?
          Tell me.    And when he said, The people fled from the battle,
          and many of the people have fallen, and died ; Saul also is dead,
        5 and his son Jonathan ; David said to the young man who told
          him, How knowest thou that Saul and his son Jonathan are
        6 dead?    And the young man who told him said, By accident I
          happened to be on mount Gelbua, and behold Saul was lean-
        7 ing on his spear ; and lo ! the chariots and horsemen were close
          upon him ; and when he looked back and saw me, he called me :
        8 and I said, Here I am.        Then he said to me, Who art thou?
        9 and I said, I am an Amelekite.       Then he said to me, Stand over
          me, I pray thee, and kill me; for I am seized with a gloomy
       10 horror, because all my life is in me.      So I went up to him and
          killed him, for I am sure he could not live after he fell ; and I
          took the crown which was on his head, and the bracelet which
       11 was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.           Then
          David took hold of his garments, and rent them, and all the
       12 men who were with him rent their garments, and beat their
          breasts, and wept, and fasted till evening for Saul, and for Jo-
          nathan his son, and for the people of Juda, and for the house
       13 of Israel, because they had been smitten with the sword.          And
          David said to the young man who told him, Whence art thou ?
       14 And he said, I am the son of a strangerâ€”an Amelekite.             And
          David said to him, How couldst thou not be afraid to lift up
       15 thy hand to kill the Lord's anointed.        Then David called one
           of his yuong men and said, Go near and fall upon him.           So he
       16 smote him that he died.      And David said to him, Thy blood be
           upon thy own head, for thy own mouth hath testified against
           thee, saying, I have slain the anointed of the Lord.
       17      Then David sung this funereal Ode over Saul, and over Jo-
           nathan his son, and gave orders that the children of Juda should
       18 learn it.   Behold it is written in the book Straight.
                                                    â€”         !    â€”â€”â€”;â€”â€”â€”!         â€”â€”â€” ;â€”â€”

                 For the slain on thy lofty mountains.
                    How are the mighty fallen
      20            Proclaim not ye the news in Geth
                 Tell it not as good news in the streets of Ascalon
                    Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice
                 Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult withjoy.
      21            On you, mountains of Gelbua, let not dew descend
                 On you, let there be no rain, nor fields of first fruit offer-
                        ings !
                    For there the shield of the mighty was battered
                 The shield of Saul.             Was he not auointed with oil ?
      22            From the blood of the wounded
                 From the fat of the mighty,
                    The bow of Jonathan recoiled not empty
                 The sword of Saul bended not in vain.
      23             Saul and Jonathan were beloved
                 They were lovely and inseparable
                     Comely in their life
                 And in their death they were not divided.
                     Than eagles they were swifter
                 And than lions more courageous.
      24                 daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
                 Who adorned your dress with scarlet
                 Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.
      25             How are the mighty fallen !
                 In the midst of the battle, Jonathan
                 On thy lofty mountains slain !
      26             I mourn for thee, my brother Jonathan,
                 To me thou wast very lovely.
                     Thy love for me was wonderful
                 Far surpassing the love of women.
      27             How are the mighty fallen !
                 And the weapons of war perished ! .
       II.        Now after these things David inquired of the Lord saying,
            May I go up to one of the cities of Juda ?                             And the Lord said
            to him, Go up.             And David said, Whither shall I go ?                          And he
            said, To Chebron.                So David went up to Chebron, with his
            two wives, Achinaam the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia late the wife
            II.             II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
       Ch.
        3 of Nabal, the Carmelite, and the men who were with him, every
           one with his household, and they dwelt in the cities of Che-
        4 bron.   And the men of Judea came, and anointed David there,
        5 to be king over the house of Juda.        And when they told Da-
           vid, saying, The men of Jabis Galaad have buried Saul, Da-
           vid sent messengers to the leaders of Jabis Galaad, and said
           unto them, Blessed are ye of the Lord, because you have
           shewn this kindness for your lord ; for Saul, the anointed of the
        6 Lord ; and have buried him and his son Jonathan.          Now there-
          fore may the Lord deal mercifully and truly with you ! As for
           me I will recompense you for this kindness, because you have
        7 done this thing.    Now therefore let your hands be strengthened,
           and be ye valiant ; for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of
           Juda have anointed me to be king over them.
        8     But Abenner, son of Ner, Saul's captain general, took Je-
           bosthe, the son of Saul, and brought him from the camp to
        9 Manaem, and made him king over Galaaditis, and over Tha-
           siri, and over Jezrael, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin,
       10 and over all Israel.    Jebosthe the son of Saul, was forty years
           old when he began to reign over Israel, and when he had
          reigned two years, (except over the house of Juda who fol-
           lowed David ; now the time which David reigned at Chebron
       12 over the house of Juda was seven years and six months)
          Abenner, son of Ner, and the servants of Jebosthe, son of Saul,
          came out from Hanaeni to Gabaon ; and Joab, son of Sa-
       13 ruia, and the servants of David went out from Chebron, and
          they met each other at the pool of Gabaon, and sat down one
           on one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the
       14 pool.   And Abenner said to Joab, let the young men, I pray
       15 thee, arise and shew feats before us.       And Joab said, let them
           arise.  Then there arose, and went over by number, twelve
          Benjaminites who were for Jebosthe, son of Saul, and twelve
       16 of the servants of David ; and they seized, every one with his
          hand, the head of his fellow, and plunged each his sword into
          his adversary's side, and fell together.      So the name of that
          place was called, Portion of ill designs.   It is near Gabaon. And
       17 the battle became very furious that day. And Abenner, with the
           men of Israel, retreated before the servants of David. Now there
       18 were there three sons of Saruia, Joab, and Abessa and Asael.
     Ck. III.            II. KINGS-It. SAMUEL.
     19 And Asael was swift of foot as a wild roe.     And Asael pursu-
         ed Abenner, and turned not aside to the right, nor to the left
     20 from following him.    And Abenner looked back and said, Art
     21 thou Asael?     And he said, I am.    Then Abenner said to him,
         Turn thee to the right, or to the left, and lay hold on one of the
         young men, and take his armour.       But Asael would not turn
     22 aside from following him.     And Abenner again said to Asael,
        Desist from following me, that I may not smite thee to the
        ground.   For how then could I hold up my face to Joab ?      And
     23 what do these things tend to?       Return to thy brother Joab.
        But he would not desist.     So Abenner smote him with a back
         stroke of his spear, into the loin, and the spear passed quite
        through him, and he fell there and died under him.       And eve-
        ry one who came to the place where Asael fell and died, stood
     24 still. But Joab and Abessa continued the pursuit after Aben-
        ner, and as the sun was setting they had got as far as the hill
        Amman, which is in front of Gai, on the way to the wilderness
     25 of Gabaon.     And the Benjaminites who followed Abenner
        crouded together, and having formed themselves into one
     26 body, they stood on the summit of a hill.     Then Abenner call-
        ed to Joab, and said, Must the sword devour to a complete
        victory ?  Knowest thou not that in the last extremity it will be
        very bitter ?  How long shall it be ere thou command the peo-
     27 pie to return from pursuing our brethren?       Whereupon Joab
        said, As the Lord liveth, but for thy speech the people might,
        from the morning, have gone up every one from the pursuit of
     28 his brother.  Then Joab sounded a trumpet and the people halt-
     29 ed, and did not pursue Israel, nor continue the battle longer.And
        Abenner and his men bent their course homeward that whole
        night, and having crossed the Jordan and passed over the ad-
     30 joining plain, they came to the camp.    And when Joab returned
        from pursuing Abenner, and had assembled all the people,
        there were missing of David's servants nineteen men, including
    31 Asael.   But the servants of David had smitten of the children
        of Benjamin, even of Abenner's men, three hundred and sixty.
    32 Then they took up Asael, and buried him in his father's tomb
        at Bethlehem.    And Joab and the men who were with him,
        marched all night, and arrived at Chebron by break of day.
    III.     Though the war was lengthened out between the house
                                                                                                                     ;

                  of Saul and the house of David, yet the house of David grew
                  stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and
              2 weaker.         For David had sons born to him in Chebron.                                      His
                  first born was Amnon, the son of Achinaam, the Jezraelitess
              3 and his second, Daluia, the son of Abigaia, the Carmelite, and
                 his third, Abessalom, the son of Maacha, a daughter of Thol-
              4 mi, king of Gessir, and his fourth, Ornia, the son of Aggith,
              5 and the fifth, Saphatia, the son of Abital, and the sixth Je-
              6 theraam, the son of Aigal, a wife of David.                                These were born
                 to David at Chebron.                    But while the war continued between
                 the house of Saul and the house of David, Abenner got a
              7 mastery over the house of Saul.                           Now Saul had a concubine
                 named Respha, a daughter of Jol.                            And Jebosthe the son of
                  Saul, said to Abenner, Why hast thou gone in to my father's
              8 concubine?             For this Abenner was exceedingly enraged at
                 Jebosthe, and said to him, Am I a dog's head ?                                    Have I now
                 dealt kindly with the house of Saul, thy father, and with his
                 brethren, and relations, and not gone over to the house of Da-
                 vid, and dost thou question me now respecting an injury done
              9 to a woman?               God do so to Abenner and more also, if, as the
            10 Lord hath sworn to David, I do not do so to him, to take the
                 kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of
            11 David over Israel and over Juda, from Dan to Bersabee.                                             So
                 Jebosthe could no more controul Abenner in any thing, be-
            12 cause he was afraid of him.                         Then Abenner sent messengers
                 to David at Thailam where he was, in all haste, saying, Make
                 a covenant with me, and behold my hand shall be with thee, to
            13 bring over all the house of Israel to thee.                                 On which David
                 said, Well, I will make a covenant with thee.                                 But one thing
                  I require of thee, and declare that thou shalt not see my face,
                 unless thou bring Melchol the daughter of Saul, when thou
            14 comest to see me.                  Then David sent messengers to Jebosthe,
                 son of Saul, saying, Restore me my wife Melchol, whom I es-
                 poused at the price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
            15 And Jabosthe sent, and took her from her husband, from Phal-
            16 tiel son of Sella ; and her husband came with her, weeping be-
            17 hind her, till they came to Barakim, Then Abenner said to him,
                  Go, return.         So he returned.             And Abenner spoke to the elders
                  of Israel, saying, Heretofore you sought to make David king
      Ch. III.            II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
      18 over you ; now therefore do it ; for the Lord hath spoken con-
         cerning David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I
         will save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of
     19 the hand of all their enemies.  Abennerspoke also in the ears of
         Benjamin.   And Abenner came to Chebron, to communicate to
         David what seemed good in the sight of Israel, and in the sight
     20 of the house of Benjamin.     And when Abenner came to David
        at Chebron, and twenty men with him, David made an entertain-
     21 ment for Abenner, and the men with him.      Then Abenner said
        to David, Let me, I pray thee, arise and go, and I will assem-
        ble all Israel before my lord the king, and make a covenant
        with him, and thou shalt reign over all that thy heart desireth.
     22 So David dismissed Abenner, and he departed in peace.       Now
        behold David's servants, and Joab, were returning from an ex-
        pedition, and bringing with them a great spoil ; and Abenner
        was not with David at Chebron, for David had sent him away,
     23 and he was gone in peace.     So when Joab and all his army ar-
        rived, and they told Joab, saying, Abenner, son of Ner, came
     24 to David, and he hath sent him away, and he has gone in peace,
        Joab went to the king, and said, What is this thou hast done ?
     25 Behold Abenner came to thee !    Why then hast thou sent him
        away?    And he is gone in peace?      Dost thou not know the
        wickedness of Abenner son of Nerâ€”that he came to deceive
        thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming inâ€”and to
     26 know all that thou art doing ?    Then Joab went out from Da-
        vid, and sent messengers after Abenner, and they brought him
     27 back from the well of Seeiram, but David knew it not.       And
        when Abenner returned to Chebron, Joab took him aside in the
        gate to speak to him, and watching an opportunity, smote him
        there in the groin, and he died, for the blood of Asael the brother
     28 of Joab.  And when David afterward heard, he said, Guiltless am
        I and my kingdom, before the Lord for ever, from the blood
     29 of Abenner, son of Ner.   Let it fall on the head of Joab, and on
        all his father's house !And may there never be wanting of the
        house of Joab, a person afflicted with a gonorrhea, or a leprosy,
        or one leaning on a staff, or falling by the sword, or lacking
    30 bread !   Now Joab and his brother Abessa, bore a grudge
        against Abenner, because he had slain their brother Asael in
    31 the battle at Gabaon.    Then David said to Joab, and to all the
           vol. i.                   3 T
                                                                                         ;   ; â€”

           Oh. IV.
                 people who were with him, Bend your garments and gird on
                 sackcloth, and utter lamentations before Abenner.                                    And king Da-
                 vid walked after the bier, and they buried Abenner at Chebron.
           32 And the king wept aloud over his grave, and all the people wept
           33 over Abenner.                   And the king chanted a funeral song over
                 Abenner, and said,
                       As dieth a criminal should Abenner die ?
                       Thy hands were not bound with chains
                       Nor thy feet with fetters.
                       He did not bring thee forth as a criminal
                       Before sons of wickedness thou hast fallen
           35          Now all the people had been assembled to bewail him ; and
                 whenall the people came to induce David to eat the funeral bread
                 while it was yet day, David swore, saying, God do so to me
                 and more also, if I taste bread, or any thing else, till the sun is
           36 set.        And when the people knew this, they were well pleased
           37 with all that the king did before the people.                                       And all the peo-
                 ple, and all Israel, that day perceived that the putting Abenner
           38 son of Ner to death, did not proceed from the king.                                                For the
                 king said to his servants, Do you not know that a great leader
           32 hath this day fallen in Israel ; and that though I am a relation,
                 and constituted a king, yet these sons of Saruia are too hard for
                 me? The Lord retribute to the doer of evil according to his
                 wickedness ?
           IV.           When Jebosthe son of Saul, heard that Abenner, son
                 of Ner, was dead at Chebron, his hands were enfeebled, and
             2 all the men of Israel were dismayed.                                      Now Jebosthe, son of
                 Saul, had two captains of bands.                              The name of the one was
                 Baana, and the name of the other Bechab.                                       They were sons of
              3 Bemmon, the Berothite, of the children of Benjamin, for Be-
                  roth had been assigned to the Benjaminites, and the Berothites
                  had fled to G-othaim, and have continued to sojourn there even
              4 to this day.              And Jonathan, son of Saul, had a son, who was
                  lame in both his feet.                  He was five years old when the news of
                  Saul and of his son Jonathan came from Jezrael, and his nurse
                  took him up and fled, and as she was hasting to carry him off, he
                  happened to fall, and became lame, so he was called Memphi-
                  bosthe.
              5         And the sons of Bemmon, the Berothite, Bechab, and
      Ch. V.                  II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
          Baana, set out, and came in the heat of the clay to the
          house of Jebosthe, while he was sleeping on his couch at noon.
       (j Now behold the door keeper of his house had been cleaning
          wheat, and being drowsy, had fallen asleep.                 So Rechab and
       7 Baana, the brothers, escaped notice, and went into the house,
          while Jebosthe was asleep on his couch in his bed chamber.
          And they smote him, and killed him, and cut offhis head.                   And
          they took his head, and travelled all night, by the way leading
          westward, and brought the head of Jebosthe to David at Che-
       8 bron, and said to the king, Behold here is the head of Jebosthe
          son of Saul thine enemy, who sought thy life ; but the Lord hath
          executed vengeance for our lord the king on his enemies as at
       9 this dayâ€”on Saul thine enemy, and on his seed.                     Whereupon
          David answered Rechab, and Baana his brother, the sons of
      10 Remmon, the Berothite, and said to them, As the Lord liveth
          who hath redeemed my soul from all affliction, when one told
          me that Saul was dead, and thought himself a messenger of
           good news to me, I apprehended him, and slew him at Seke-
          lak, though he thought himself entitled to a reward from me
      11 for his good news.          But now wicked men have slain a righte-
          ous    person,    in  his   house,    upon his bed.           Now therefore
          I will avenge his blood on you and cut you off from the
      12 earth.     Then David gave orders to his servants, and they in-
           stantly slew them, and cut off their hands, and their feet, and
           hanged them up by the pool of Chebron.                    And they buried
           the head of Jebosthe in the grave of Abenner son of Ner.
      V.         Then all the tribes of Israel came to David to Chebron
        2 and said to him, Behold we are thy bone and thy flesh.                    Here-
           tofore, while Saul was king over us, It was thou who didst
           lead out and bring in Israel ; and the Lord said to thee, Thou
           shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my
        3 people Israel.       And when all the elders of Israel came to Da-
           vid to Chebron, king David made a covenant with them at
           Chebron, before the Lord, and they anointed David to be king
           over all Israel.
        4      David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and
        5 he reigned forty years.          Seven years and six months he reign-
           ed at Chebron over Juda, and he reigned thirty three years,
           over all Israel and Juda, at Jerusalem.
       Ch. V.            II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
        6     When David and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites
          who inhabited that land, it was said to David, Thou shalt not
          come here ; for the blind and the lame are opposed to it, saying,
        7 David shall not come here.   So when David took the fortress, Zi-
        8 on, the same is the city of David, on that day David said,
          Whoever smiteth the Jebusites, let him also dispatch with a
          dagger those lame and those blind, even them who hate the soul
          of David : for this cause they say, The blind and the lame shall
        9 not come into the house of the Lord.      And David made his
          abode in the fort, so it was called the city of David. And Da-
       10 vid built the city, around the citadel and his own house.   And
          David advanced in prosperity, and grandeur, and the Lord
       11 Almighty was with him.      And Chiram, king of Tyre, sent
          messengers to David, with cedar timber, and carpenters, and
          masons, and they built a house for David.
       12    When David perceived that the Lord had prepared him
          to be king over Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted for
      13 the sake of his people Israel, David took still more wives and
          concubines out of Jerusalem, after he came from Chebron.
          And David had still more sons and daughters born to him.
      14 Now these are the names of those who were born to him in
          Jerusalem.  Sammus, and Sobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
          and Ebear, and Elisue, and Naphek, and Jephies, and Elisa-
          ma, and Elidae, and Eliphalath, Samae, Jesibath, Nathan,
          Galamaan, Jebar, Theesus, Eliphalat, Naged, Naphek, Jona-
          than, Leasamus, Baalimath, Eliphaath.
      17     When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king
          over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David ; and when
      18 David heard he went down to the fort.       And the Philistines
          came, and made an irruption into the valley of the Titans.
      19 Whereupon David inquired of the Lord saying, Shall I go up
          against the Philistines?    Wilt thou deliver them into my
          hands ? And the Lord said to David, Go up ; for I will assuredly
      20 deliver the Philistines into thy hands.     So David went out
          through Upper breaks, and smote the Philistines there.  Where-
         upon David said, The Lord broke through the Philistine
         enemies before me, as waters burst through mounds.      For this
      21 cause the name of that place, was called Upper hreaks.      And
                                                                                                                                                ;

         Ch. VI.
               there they left their gods ; and David and the men who were
               with him took them.
        22            Again the Philistines proceeded to come up, and made
        23 another irruption into the valley of the Titans.                                                        And when Da-
               vid inquired of the Lord, the Lord said, Thou shalt not go up
               to meet them in front.                                 Wheel about from them, and come
        21 upon them near Wailing.                                      And when thou nearest the sound
               of a rustling in the grove of Wailing, then thou shalt go down
               against them; for the Lord will then go out before thee, to
        25 smite in the battle of the Philistines.                                                 And David did as the
               Lord commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Gaba-
               on to the land of Gazera.
        VI.             Again David assembled all the young men of Israel, about
           2 seventy thousand.                         And David arose, and set out on his march,
               he and all the people with him, and some of the chiefs of Juda,
               to bring up thence the ark of God, which is called by the name
               of the Lord of hosts enthroned on the cherubims, which are on
           :>  it.      Andhavingputthe ark of the Lord in anew car,they brought
                it    from the house of Aminadab, who dwelt on the mount.
                And Oza, and his brothers the sons of Aminadab, led the
           I car with the ark.                        His brothers marched before the ark.                                              And
           5 David and the Israelites played on high toned instruments
               of music, accompanied with songs, and on kinyras and on
               nablas, and on tympanums, and on cymbals, and on harps.
           6 But when they came to the threshing floor of Nachor, Oza
                stretched forth his hand upon the ark of God to stay it, and
           7 took hold of it, because the young bull shook it.                                                          And the an-
                ger of the Lord was kindled against Oza, and he smote him
           8 there, by the ark of the Lord, in the presence of God.                                                                     Now
                David was disheartened because the Lord had broke out
           9 upon Oza, and that place is to this day called Breach of Oza
                and David was afraid of the Lord that day, saying, How shall
         10 the ark of the Lord come to me?                                                 So David was not willing
                that the ark of the covenant of the Lord should turn aside to
                him, into the city of David, and David caused it to turn aside
         11 to the house of Abeddara, the Gethite.                                              And the ark of the Lord
                abode in the house of Abeddara the Gethite three months, and
                the Lord blessed the whole house of Abeddara, and all belong-
         12 ing to him.                    And when they told king David saying, The Lord
       Ch. VII.           II.  KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
           bath blessed tbe house of Abeddara, and all belonging to him,
           on account of the ark of God, David went and brought up the
           ark of the Lord out of the house of Abeddara, into the city of
       13 David, with rejoicing.     Now there were with him seven choirs
           carrying the ark, and for a sacrifice a young bull and lambs.
       14 And David played on well tuned instruments of music be-
           fore the Lord ; and David having put on an unusual robe, he,
       15 and all the house of Israel, brought up the ark of the Lord,
       16 with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.       And as the
           ark was entering the city of David, Melchol the daughter of
           Saul looked out at a window, and saw king David dancing, and
       17 playing before the Lord, and despised him in her heart.           So
           they brought the ark of the Lord, and when they had set it in
           its place, in the middle of the tabernacle, which David had
           erected for it, David offered whole burnt offerings before the
       18 Lord, and peace offerings.     And when David had made an end
           of offering the whole burnt offerings, and the peace offerings,
           he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts, and
       19 distributed to all the people through the whole host of Israel,
           from Dan to Bersabee, both to the men and women, to every
           one a piece of bread, and a piece of roasted meat, and a sweet
           cake baked in the pan.      Then all the people departed, every
           one to his house, and David returned to salute his house-
       20 hold.   And jtfelchol the daughter of Saul came out to meet
           David, and when she had saluted him, she said, How was
           the king of Israel glorified to-day in the eyes of his maid ser-
       21 vants, disrobed as he was like one of the dancers!          Where-
           upon David said to Melchol, I will dance before the Lord.
           Blessed be the Lord, who hath chosen me in preference to
           thy father, and in preference to all his house, to make me ru-
       22 ler over his people, over Israel.     Wherefore I will play and
           dance before the Lord, and I will again disrobe myself in the
           same manner, though I should be despicable in thy sight, and
           with the maidens, by whom thou hast intimated that I am not
       23 honoured.    Hence Melchol the daughter of Saul had no child
           to the day of her death.
       VII.      Now when the king was settled in his house, and the
        2 Lord had given him rest on every side, from all his enemies
           round about, the king said to Nathan the prophet, Behold I
    Ch. VII.           IT. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
        dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth in the
     3 midst of the tabernacle.   Upon which Nathan said to the king,
        Whatever may be in thy heart, go and do ; for the Lord is
     4 with thee.    But that night a word of the Lord came to
     5 Nathan saying, Go and say to my servant David, Thus
        saith the Lord, Art not thou to build me a house to dwell in?
     6 Because I did not dwell in a house from the day I brought the
        children of Israel out of Egypt even to this day, but continued
        walking about in a temporaryabode and inatabernacle in all the
     7 places through which I passed with all Israel, did I ever speak
        to any tribe of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people
        Israel, and say, Why have you not built for me a house of cedar ?
     8 But now, thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith
        the Lord Almighty, I took thee from the sheepcot to be ruler
     9 over my peopleâ€”over Israel; and I have been with thee
        whithersoever thou didst go, and have destroyed all thine ene-
        mies from before thee, and made thee renowned according to
    10 the renown of the great men on the earth ; and I will appoint a
        place for my people Israel, and plant them, and they shall dwell
        by themselves, and shall no more be in trouble; nor shall a
        son of wickedness any more humble them as heretofore, from
    11 the days I appointed judges over my people Israel : and I will
        give thee rest from all thine enemies, and the Lord will tell
    12 thee that thou art to build a house for him.   And it shall come
        to pass when thy days are fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with
        thy fathers, that I will raise up after thee the seed of thee who
        shall spring from thy loins, and I will establish his kingdom.
    13 He shall build a house for my name, and I will raise up again
    14 his throne for ever.  I will be to him a father, and he shall be to
        me a son.   And when his iniquity shall come, I will correct
        him with a rod of men, and with scourges of the children of
     15 men, but I will not withdraw my mercy from him as I with-
     16 drew it from them whom I removed from my presence.           His
        house and his kingdom shall be established for ever before
        me and his throne shall be raised up again for ever.
     17     According to all these words and according to all this vi-
     18 sion, so did Nathan speak to David.     Whereupon king David
        went in and sat down before the Lord, and said, Who am I,
           Lord, my Lord ! and what is my house that thou hast loved
                                                                                                                    ;
            Ch. VIII.                   II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
           19 me to such a degree !                     Though I was contemptibly little be-
                 fore thee,          Lord, my Lord ! yet thon hast spoken respecting
                 the house of thy servant for a great while to come.                              With regard
                to this law of the man,                       Lord, my Lord ! what more shall
           20 David presume to say to thee ?                           Now then, thou,                Lord, my
           21 Lord ! knowest thy servant, and on account of thy servant
                thou hast done, and according to thine own heart hast made
                all this greatness in order to make known to thy servant with
           22 respect to the magnifying of thee,                               my Lord ! that there is
                none like thee, and that there is not a god besides thee among
           23 all that we have heard of with our ears.                               Moreover what other
                nation is there on the earth like thy people Israel ?                                 How hath
                God gone before them to redeem a people for himselfâ€”to
                make thyself a nameâ€”to display majesty and an appearance of
                deityâ€”to drive out from before thy people, whom thou hadst
           24 redeemed for thyself out of Egypt, nations and wandering
                hordes !        Thou indeed preparedst for thyself thy people Israel to
           25 be a people for ever, and thou,                          Lord ! wast their God.                 Now
                therefore,             my Lord, confirm the word which thou hast
                 spoken concerning thy servant and his house, confirm it ever-
           26 lastingly,            Lord Almighty, O God of Israel.                        And now as thou
                hast spoken let thy name be magnified for ever.
           27         O Lord Almighty,                   God of Israel, thou hast made a reve-
                lation to thy servant, saying, I am to build a house for thee
                therefore thy servant hath found this disposition of his heart
           28 to make this prayer to thee.                           And now,               Lord, my Lord,
                Thou art God, and thy words will be true, and thou hast
           29 spoken these good things respecting thy servant, now then be-
                 gin and bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for
                 ever before thee.             Since thou              Lord, my Lord, hast spoken,
                therefore with thy blessing, let the house of thy servant be bless-
                ed, that it may continue for ever.
           VIII.           After this David smote the Philistines, aud subdued
                them, and took the country, appurtenant to the cities, out of
             2 the hand of the Philistines.                     David also smote Moab, and mea-
                 sured them with lines, having caused them to dwell in the
                 country, and there were two lines to be put to death, and two
                lines to be saved alive.                  So Moab became servants to David,
             3 and brought him gifts.                      David also smote Adraazar, son of
     Ch. VIII.         II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
        Kaab king of Suba.    As he was going to establish his autho-
      4 rity oyer the river Euphrates, David intercepted a thousand
        of his chariots, and seven thousand cavalry, and twenty thou-
        sand infantry; and David destroyed all the chariots, except
      5 one hundred which he reserved for himself.    And when Syria
        of Damascus came to assist Adraazar king of Suba, David
      6 smote of the Syrians twenty two thousand men, and David plac-
        ed a garrison in Syria at Damascus, and the Syrians became ser-
      7 vants to David and brought him gifts.    So the Lord preserved
        David withersoever he went.     And David took the breast-
        plates of gold, which were on the servants of Adraazar, king
        of Suba and brought them to Jerusalem.    Now these were they
        which Susakim king of Egypt took when he came up against
      8 Jerusalem, in the days of Koboam son of Solomon.     And from
        Metebak, and from the principal cities of Adraazar, king
        David took brass in great abundance, of which Solomon made
        the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the lavers, and all the ves-
      9 sels of brass. And when Thoou, the king of Emath, heard
        that David had smitten all the army of Adraazar, Thoou sent
        his son Jedduram to king David to salute him courteously,
    10 and congratulate him for having fought Adraazar, and smitten
        him; for he was at enmity with Adraazar.       And Jedduram
        brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and
    11 vessels of brass. And king David dedicated these to the Lord,
        with the silver and the gold which he had dedicated out of
    12 all the cities which he had subduedâ€”Out of Idumea and
        Moab, and the children of Ammon, and the Philistines, and
        Amelek, and the spoils of Adraazar, son of Kaab king of Su-
    13 ba.   Thus David made himself renowned.       And when he re-
       turned, he smote of the Idumeans at Gebelim, to the number
    14 of eighteen thousand, and placed garrisons in Idumea, through-
       out the whole extent of it. So all the Idumeans became servants
       to the king.    And the Lord preserved David whithersoever
    15 he went.   And David reigned over all Israel.   And David ex-
    16 ecuted judgment and justice over all his people.     And Joab
       son of Saruia was at the head of the army, and Josaphat son
    17 of, Achilud was recorder, and Sadok, son of Achitob, and
       Achimelech son of Abiathar, were priests; and Sasa was the
    18 scribe ; and Banaias son of Jodae was counsellor ; and the Che-
           VOL. I.                3 u
                 â€”
      Ch. IX.            II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
          lethites, and the Phelethites, and David's sons, were the pa-
          lace guards.
      IX.     AndDavidsaid, Is there any yet left of the house of Saul, that
       2 I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake ?     Now there was
          a servant of the house of Saul, whose name was Siba.         So
          they called him to David.  And the king said to him, Art thou
       3 Siba?    And he said, I am thy servant.   Then the king said to
          him, Is there any man yet left of the house of Saul, that I may
          treat him with all the kindness possible ? And when Siba said
       4 to the king, There is still a son of Jonathan who is disabled
          in his feet, the king said to Siba, Where is he?      And Siba
          said to the king, Behold at the house of Machir, son of Amiel
       5 of Lodabar.    Thereupon king David sent for him from the
       6 house of Machir, son of Amiel of Lodabar.       And when Mein-
          phibosthe son of Jonathan, son of Saul was brought before
          king David, he fell on his face, and made obeisance to him.
          And when David said to him, Memphibosthe !       He said, Here
       7 am I thy servant.     Then David said to him, Fear not; for
          I will indeed deal kindly with thee, for Jonathan thy father's
         sake, and restore thee all the fields of Saul thy grandfather,
       8 and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.    Upon which
         Memphibosthe bowed down, and said, Who am I thy ser-
         vant, that thou shouldst look on such a dead dog as I am ?
       9 Then the king called Siba, the servant of Saul, and said to
         him, All that belong to Saul and his house I have given to thy
      10 master's son.   Therefore work thou the land for him ; both
         thou and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in
         provisions for thy master's son, that he may have bread to
         eat.   And Memphibosthe, thy master's son, shall eat bread
         continually at my table.   Now Siba had fifteen sons, and twen-
      11 ty servants.  And Siba said to the king, According to all that
         the king hath commanded his servant, so will thy servant do.
      12 So Memphibosthe ate at David's table, like one of the king's
         sons ; and Memphibosthe had a young son whose name was
         Micha ; and all the family of the house of Siba were servants
      13 of Memphibosthe.      And Memphibosthe dwelt at Jerusalem,
         for he ate continually at the king's table, and was lame in both
          his feet.
      Ch. X.             TT. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
      X.     Now after this the king of the Ammonites died, and An-
       2 non his son reigned in his stead.    Whereupon David said, I
         will shew kindness to Annon, son of Naas, as his father shew-
         ed kindness to me.     So David sent his servants to comfort
       3 him for the death of his father.    But when David's servants
         came to the land of the Ammonites, the chiefs of the children
         of Amnion said to Annon their lord, Is it to honour thy father
         in thy presence, that David hath sent thee comforters?     Is it
         not rather that they may examine the city and view it ?    It is
         indeed for the purpose of spying it, that David hath sent these
       4 servants of his to thee.Upon this Annon took David's servants,
         and shaved their beards, and cut off one half of their upper gar-
       5 ments, even up to the loins, and sent them away.      And when
         David was informed touching his men, he sent to meet them,
         for the men had been greatly dishonoured, and the king said,
      6 Tarry at Jericho till your beards grow, and then return.    Now
         when the children of Amnion saw that David's people were
         dishonoured, they sent, and hired the Syrians of Baithraam,
         and the Syrians of Suba and Koob, twenty thousand infantry,
         and of the king of Amelek, a thousand men, and of Istob
      7 twelve thousand men.     And when David heard it, he sent out
      8 Joab, and all the army, even all the mighty men.   And the chil-
         dren of Ammon came out and drew up for battle before the
         gate of the city ; and the Syrians of Suba, and Koob, with Is-
      9 tob, and x\.melek, were by themselves in the fields.   When Jo-
         ab saw that there was a front of battle against him both before
        and behind, he made a draught from among all the youth of
         Israel, and set them in array against the Syrians, and he com-
     10 mitted the residue of the people to his brother Abessa ; and
     11 they drew up in array against the children of Ammon.        And
        Joab said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, you must come
        to my assistance ; and if the children of Ammon be too strong
     12 for thee, we will come to save thee.   Act manfully, and let us
        shew our courage for our people and for the cities of our God.
     13 And the Lord will do what is good in his sight.      Then Joab,
        and all his people with him, advanced to battle against the Sy-
     14 rians, and they fled before him.     And when the Ammonites
        saw that the Syrians fled, they also fled before Abessa, and
        entered the city.   Whereupon Joab returned from the chil-
       Ch. XL             II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
       15 dren of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.        Now when the Sy-
          rians saw that they had given way before Israel, they assein-
       16 bled together, and Adraazar sent and collected the Syrians
          from the banks of the river Chalamak, and they came to Ai-
          lam, with Sobak, the commander in chief of Adraazar's ar-
       17 my, at their head.    When this was told David, he assembled
          all Israel, and crossed the Jordan, and came to Ailam; and the
       18 Syrians drew up in array against David, and fought him.     But
          the Syrians fled before Israel, and David destroyed of Syria
          seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen.         He
          smote also Sobak the commander in chief of the army, so that
      19 he died there.   And when all the kings who were vassals of
          Adraazar saw that they were smitten before Israel, they re-
          volted, and joined Israel and served them.    So Syria was inti-
          midated from aiding the Ammonites any more.
      XL       Andwhen the season of theyear returned for kings to go out
          to battle, David sent out Joab, and all his servants with him,
          and all Israel, and they destroyed the children of Amnion, and
        2 besieged Kabbath : but David abode at Jerusalem.        And it
          happened, that one afternoon, David arose from his couch,
          and walked on the roof of the king's house, and from the top
          of the house he saw a woman bathing, and she was very beau-
       3 tiful.  So David sent and sought out the woman, and one said,
          Is not this Bersabe, the daughter of Eliab, the wife of Ourias,
       4 the Chettite?    Whereupon David sent messengers, and took
          her, and went in unto her, and lay with her.     And when she
          had purified herself from her uncleanness, she returned to her
       5 house.   And the woman conceived, and sent and told David,
        6 saying, I am with child.   Whereupon David sent to Joab, say-
        7 ing, Send Ourias the Chettite to me.    So Joab sent Ourias to
          David.   And on his arrival, Ourias went directly to him.  And
          when David had inquired of the welfare of Joab, and the wel-
        8 fare of the people, and the success of the war, he said to Ourias,
          Go down to thy house and wash thy feet.       So Ourias depart-
          ed from the king's house, and there was sent after him a por-
        9 tion of meat from the king.   But Ourias laid himself down to
          sleep at the king's gate, with the servants of his lord, and did
       10 not go down to his house.   And when they told David, saying,
          Ourias did not go down to his house, David said to Ourias,
     Ch. XL             II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
         Art thou not come from a journey, why then didst thou not
     11 go down to thy house?      And Ourias said to David, The ark,
        and Israel, and Juda, dwell in tents, and my lord Joab, and the
        servants of my lord encamp on the ground, and shall I go
        down to my house to eat and drink, and lie with my wife?
        How can I do it ?   As thy soul liveth, I will do no such thing.
     12 Then David said to Ourias, Tarry here to-day also, and to-
        morrow I will dismiss thee.     So Ourias tarried at Jerusalem
     13 that day and the morrow.   And David invited him, and he ate
        and drank in his presence.     But though he caused him to
        drink, and made him drunk, yet he went out in the evening,
        to sleep on his bed with the king's servants, and did not go
     14 down to his house.    And in the morning David wrote a letter
        to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Ourias, and in the letter he
     15 wrote, saying, Set Ourias in the front of the hottest battle,
     16 and retire from him, that he may be smitten and die.      So in
        disposing the guards against the city, Joab stationed Ourias in
     17 the place where he knew there were men of valour.      And the
        men of the city sallied out, and fought with Joab, and some of
        the people of David's servants fell, and Ourias the Chittite died
     IS also. ThenJoab sent and told David all the circumstances of the
     19 battle, which were to be delivered verbally to the king.    And
        he gave a charge to the messenger, saying, When thou hast
        finished telling the kins: all the circumstances of the battle, if
     20 it should happen that the king's anger rise, and he should say
        to thee, Why did you approach so near to the city to fight?
     21 Did you not know that they would shoot from the top of the
         wall?   Who smote Abimelech son of Jerobaal, son of Ner?
         Did not a woman throw a piece of a millstone on him from the
     22 top of the wall, so that he died at Thamasi ?  Why did you ap-
        proach the wall ?  Then thou shalt say, Thy servant Ourias the
        Chettite is also dead.   So Joab's messenger went to Jerusalem
        to the king, and when he arrived and told David all that Joab
        mentioned to himâ€”all the circumstances of the battle, David
        was inflamed with wrath against Joab, and said to the messen-
        ger, Why did you approach so near the city to fight?        Did
        you not know that you would be smitten from the wall ?     Who
         smote Abimelech, son of Jerobaal ?   Did not a woman throw a
         millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thamasi ?
          XII.            II. KINGSâ€”11. SAMUEL.
      Ch.
      23 Why did you approach so near the wall?         Then the messen-
          ger said to David, The men took courage against us, and sal-
          lied out upon us into the field, and when we continued our
          pursuit of them, even to the doors of the gate, the archers
      24 from the wall shot at thy servants, so that some of the king's
          servants were slain, and thy servant Ourias the Chettite is
      25 dead also.    Thereupon David said to the messenger, Thus
          shaft thou say to Joab, Let not this be grievous in thy sight;
          for the sword devoureth sometimes on one side, and some-
          times on the other.   Make thy battle strong against the city,
          and block it up, and enclose it with strong works.
      26     Now when the wife of Ourias heard that Ourias her hus-
      27 band was dead, she mourned for her husband.       And when her
          mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house,
          and she became his wife, and bore him a son.
      XII.      But the deed which David had done appeared evil in the
          sight of the Lord ; therefore the Lord sent Nathan the prophet
          to David.   And when he came to David he said to him, There
          were two men in the same city.      The one was rich, and the
       2 other poor.   The rich man had flocks and herds in great abun-
       3 dance, but the poor man had only one little ewe lamb, which
          he bought, and nourished, and fed : and it had grown up with
          him and his children in the same house.     It ate of his bread,
          and drank of his cup, and slept in his bosom, and was to him
       4 like a daughter.   And there came a traveller to the rich man,
          and he spared to take of his own flocks, or of his own herds,
          to entertain the strangerâ€”the wayfaring man, who had come
          to him ; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the
       5 man who came to him.       And David was inflamed with indig-
          nation against the man to a great degree, and said to Nathan,
       6 As the Lord liveth, the man who hath done this is guilty of
          death, and shall make sevenfold restitution for the lamb, because
       7 he hath done such a deed and had no compassion.      Whereupon
          Nathan said to David, Thou art the man who hath done this.
          Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, I anointed thee to be king
          over Israel, and it was I who delivered thee out of the hand of
          Saul, and gave thee the house of thy master, and thy master's
       8 wives into thy bosom.   I gave thee also the house of Israel and
          Juda, and if this had not been enough, I would have added still
                                                                                                                        !
      Ch. XII.                          II. KINGS-II. SAMUEL.
        9 more.          Why then hast thou despised the word of the Lord, to
            do evil in his sight ?                Thou hast slain Ourias the Chettite with
            the sword, and taken his wife to be thy wife.                                   Thou hast indeed
      10 slain him with the sword of the Ammonites.                                             Now therefore
            the sword shall never depart from thy house.                                          Because thou
            hast despised me, and taken the wife of Ourias the Chettite to
      11 be thy wife, therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I will raise
            up evils against thee out of thy own house ; and I will take thy
            wives before thy eyes, and give them to thy neighbour, and he
      12 will lie with thy wives in the face of the sun.                                           Thou indeed
            didst act secretly ; but I will do this thing in the sight of all Is-
            rael, and in the face of yonder sun.
      13          Then David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord.
            And Nathan said to David, The Lord hath put away thy sin.
      14 Thou shalt not die.                    But because thou hast by this deed given
            great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, there-
      15 fore thy son who is born to thee shall surely die.                                        Then Nathan
            went to his house, and the Lord struck the child which the wife
      16 of Ourias the Chettite bore to David.                                    x\nd while it was sick
            David besought God for the child, and fasted and went in and
      17 lay on the ground.                       And when the elders of his house came
            to raise him from the ground, he would not consent, nor would
      18 he eat bread with them.                        And on the seventh day the child died.
            And David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was
            dead ; for they said, Behold while the child was still living we
            spoke to him, but he would not hearken to our voice, how
            then must it affect him when we tell him, The child is dead
       19 But when David perceived that his servants were whispering,
            he conjectured that the child was dead, therefore David said to
       20 his servants, Is the child dead?                               And when they said, He is
            dead, David arose, and washed, and anointed himself, and
            changed his clothes, and went into the house of God, and wor-
            shipped him.              Then he went to his own house, and called for
       21 bread to eat.                And when they had set bread before him, and
            he had eaten, his servants said to him, What is this that thou
            hast done for the child?                       While it was still living, thou didst
            fast, and weep, and kept thyself awake; but soon as the child
       22 is dead, thou hast risen up, and eaten, and drank.                                          And David
             said, While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, because
        Ch. XIII.             II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
            I said, Who knoweth but the Lord may have compassion on
        23 me, and the child may live?          But now it is dead, why then
            should I fast ?  Can I bring it back again ?     I shall go to it ; but
            it will never return to me.
        24      Then David comforted his wife Bersabe, and went in unto
            her; and she conceived, and bore a son, and called his name
        25 Solomon.     And the Lord loved him, and sent by the ministry
            of Nathan the prophet, and called his name Jeddedi, For the
            sake of the Lord.
        26      Now Joab had fought at Babbath of the Ammonites, and
        27 taken the royal city.      Wherefore Joab sent messengers to Da-
            vid, and said, I have had a battle at Babbath, and have taken
        28 the city of waters ; now therefore assemble the rest of the peo-
            ple, and encamp against the city, and take it, lest I take the
        29 city, and it be called after my name.         So David assembled all
            the people, and went to Babbath, and fought against it and took
        30 it.   And he took the crown of Molchom their king from his
            head.   Now the weight of it was a talent of gold, with precious
        31 stones, and it was set on David's head.          And he brought out
            the spoils of the city in great abundance, and he brought out
            the people who were in it, and put them to the saw, and to iron
            crows, and to pick axes of iron, and distributed them through
           brick yards.    And when he had done the same to all the cities
           of the Ammonites, David, and all the people, returned to Jeru-
           salem.
        XIII.      After this, Abessalom, a son of David, having a very
           beautiful sister whose name was Themar, Amnon the son of
         2 David fell in love with her.         And Amnon was so distressed
           that he pined away on account of Themar his sister, for she
           was a virgin, and it appeared monstrous in the eyes of Amnon
         3 to have any thing to do with her.           Now Amnon had a com-
           panion whose name was Jonadab.            He was the son of Samaa
         4 the brother of David.      And Jonadab was a man of great subtil-
           ty ; and he said to him, What is the matter with thee, son of
           the king, that thou art so languishing for some time past?
           Why dost thou not tell me ?          And Amnon said to him, I am
           in love with Themar, the sister of my brother Abessalom.
         5 Upon this Jonadab said to him, Take to thy bed, and feign
           thyself sick, and when thy father conieth to see thee say to
                                                                                                                                    ;
       Ch. XIII.                             II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
             hiin, I pray thee, let Themar my sister come to me, and feed
             me; and let her prepare the victuals in my sight, that I may
         6 see, and eat out of her hands.                                     So Amnon went to bed, and
             feigned himself sick :                       and when the king came to see him,
             Amnon said to the king, I pray thee let Themar my sister
             come to me, and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I
        7 may eat out of her hands.                                  And David sent to the house to
             Themar, and said, Go, I pray thee, to thy brother's house,
        8 and prepare something for him to eat.                                              Accordingly Themar
             went to the house of Amnon, her brother, and he was a bed
             and she took the dough, and kneaded it, and made it into
         9 cakes before his eyes, and stewed them and she took the pan
            and poured them out before him, but he would not eat.                                                          Then
      10 Amnon said, Go out every man from me.                                                      And when every
            one was gone out from him, Amnon said to Themar, Bring
            the victuals into the chamber that I may eat out of thy hand-
            So Themar took the cakes she had made and carried them to her
      11 brother Amnon into the bed chamber.                                               But when she brought
            them to him, that he might eat, he took hold of her and said
      12 to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.                                             And she said to him,
            No, my brother, thou must not dishonour me ; for such a
            thing ought not to be done in Israel.                                        Thou must not commit
      13 such folly.                 As for me where could I hide my dishonour?
            And with regard to thyself, thou wouldst be like one of the
            fools in Israel.               Now therefore, speak I pray thee to the king ;
      14 for he will not withhold me from thee.                                                But Amnon would
            not hearken to her, but overpowered her by force, and dis-
     15 honoured her.                    And when he had lain with her, Amnon hated
            her with an exceeding great hatred ; so that the hatred with
            which he hated her, was greater than the love with which he
           had loved her, and his last wickedness was greater than the
     16 first.            And Amnon said to her, Arise and begone.                                                    Where-
            upon Themar said to him, To send me thus away is adding
            a still greater injury to that which thou hast already done me.
     17 But Amnon would not hearken to her voice, but called his
           servant who superintended his house, and said to him, Send
           away, I pray thee, this one from me, out of doors, and shut
     18 the door after her.                           Now she had on an embroidered robe
                                                                                                                                   ;
           for such was the dress which the king's daughters wore, who
                  vol. I.                                            3 x

       Ch.
           were virgins.   So when the servant led her out, and shut the
       19 door after her, Theniar took ashes, and put them on her head,
          and tore in pieces the embroidered robe which she had on,
       20 and putting her hands on her head, she went on crying.         And
          Abessalom her brother said to her, Hath Amnon thy brother
          been with thee ?      Now therefore, my sister, hold thy peace.
           Because he is thy brother, thou must not mention this mat-
          ter.  So Theniar abode as a widow in the house of her bro-
          ther Abessalom.
       21     Though king David heard all these things, and was very
          angry, yet he would not grieve the spirit of his son Amnon,
       22 because he loved him as being his first born.        As for Abessa-
          lom he spoke not a word to Amnon, good or bad, for he hated
          Amnon for having dishonoured his sister Theniar.
       23     Now about two years after this Abessalom had sheep
          shearers at Belasor, in the borders of Ephraim ; and Abessalom
       24 invited all the king's sons.    And Abessalom went to the king,
          and said, Behold they are shearing thy servant's sheep, let the
       25 king I pray thee, and his servants, go with thy servant.        But
          the king said to Abessalom, No, my son.          We must not all
          go ; for we must not overburthen thee.       When he had pressed
          him, and he would not consent to go but blessed him ; then
       26 Abessalom said to him, If not ; let my brother Amnon, I pray
       27 thee, go with us.   And the king said, Why should he go with
          thee ?   But Abessalom pressed him, so he sent with him Am-
           non, and all the king's sons.   And Abessalom made a banquet
       28 like that of the king.     And Abessalom gave a charge to his
           servants saying, Observe when the heart of Amnon is elated
           with wine, and I say to you, Smite Amnon ; then put him to
           death.  Be not afraid, for it is I who command you.         Acquit
       29 yourselves like men, and be sons of valour.         And when the
           servants of Abessalom had done to Amnon as Abessalom had
           commanded them, all the king's sons arose, and mounted
       30 every man his mule, and fled.       And while they were on the
           road, the report came to David saying, Abessaloni hath slain
       31 all the king's sonsâ€”there is not one of them left.       Thereupon
           the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the ground,
           and all his servants stood around him, with their clothes rent.
       32 And Jonadab, son of Samaa, David's brother, addressing him
                                                                         â€”
      Ch. XIV.            II. KINGS-II. SAMUEL.
         said, Let not my lord the king suppose that he hath slain all
         the young men, the king's sons, for Amnon only is dead
         for he hath been continually in the mouth of Abessalom from the
      33 day he dishonoured his sister Themar.       Now therefore let not
         the king lay this to heart, saying, All the king's sons are dead ;
         for there is none dead but only Amnon ; and Abessalom hath
     34 made his escape.    Then the servant who stood centinel raised
         his eyes, and looked, and lo, many people were coming down
         the side of the mountain by the way behind him, whereupon
         the centinel came, and told the king, saying, I have seen
         many people coming by the way of Oronen, from the side of
     35 the mountain.      And Jonadab said to the king, Behold the
      36 king's sons are near at hand.      It is as thy servant said. And
         just as he had finished speaking, behold the king's sons came,
         and they raised their voice, and wept, and the king also, and
     37 all   his  servants, wept bitterly.    And Abessaloni fled, and
         went to Tholmi, son of Emiud, king of Gedsur, to the land
         of Chamaachad.      And king David mourned for his son all
         that year.
     38      Now when Abessalom, who had left his country, and gone
         to Gedsur, had been there three years, king David was molli-
         fied so as to long for Abessalom, for he was comforted with
     XIV.       respect to Amnon, seeing he was dead.        So when Joab,
         son of Saruia, perceived that the king's heart was set upon
       2 Abessalom, he sent to Thekoe, and brought thence a wise
         woman, and said to her, Feign thyself, I pray thee, to be a
         mourner, and put on mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself
         with oil, but be like a woman mourning for one who hath
       3 been long dead : and thou shalt go to the king, and speak to
       4 him in this mannerâ€”So Joab put words in her mouth.            And
         when the woman of Thekoe came to the king, she fell on her
         face on the ground, and made obeisance to him, and said,
       5 Save,    king ! save !  And the king said to her, What is the
       6 matter with thee ?   To which she replied, I am a wretched wo-
         man, a widow.    My husband died.      And thy servant had two
         sons, and they quarrelled in the field, and there was none to
         part them, and one of them smote the otherâ€”his brother, and
       7 killed him.   And behold the whole family is risen up against
         thy servant, and say, Deliver up him who smote his brother,
                                                                                                                              ;
            Ch. XIV.                          II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
                  that we may put hiui to death, for the life of his brother whom
                  he hath slain ; for we will cut him off though he be your heir.
                  Thus will they quench my coal, which is left, so that there will
                  not be left to my husband a remnant, or a name, on the face of
              8 the earth. Thereupon the king said to the woman, Go in peace to
              9 thy house, and I will give orders concerning thee.                                        And the wo-
                  man of Thekoe said to the king, Upon me,                                      my lord the king,
                  be the iniquity, and upon my father's house ; and let the king
            10 and his throne be guiltless !                         Then the king said, Let who will
                  speak to thee, bring him to me, and he shall no more touch
                 him.        And she said, Let the king, I pray thee, make mention
            11 of the Lord his God, that though avengers of blood be multi-
                 plied to destroy, they shall not destroy my son.                                           Whereupon
                 he said, As the Lord liveth, there shall not a hair of thy son's
                 head fall to the ground.
           12          Then the woman said, Let thy servant, I pray thee, speak
           13 a word to my lord the king, and he said, Speak,                                             xind the wo-
                 man said, Why hast thou come to such a determination against
                 the people of God ?                    Or is that word, That the king would not
                 recal his own exile, a kind of trespass from the mouth of the
           14 king ?            Because we must surely die, and be like water spilt
                 on the ground, which cannot be gathered up againâ€”and God
                 can take away life when he is determined to remove an outcast
           15 from him; now therefore in respect to the matter about which
                 I came to speak to my lord the king, Because the people will
                 see me, therefore thy servant will say, Pray speak to my lord
                 the king           perhaps the king will grant the request of his ser-
                                 ;
           16 vant.           Because the king will hear, let him deliver his servant
                 out of the hand of the man who seeketh to remove me and my
           17 son from the inheritance of the Lord.                                     Then the woman said,
                 Let the word of my lord the king be, I pray, for a sacrifice
                 for since my lord the king is as an angel of God to discern
                 what is good and what is bad, surely the Lord thy God must
                 be with thee.
           18          Then the king answered and said to the woman, Conceal
                 not from me I pray thee, the thing which I shall ask thee.                                            And
                 the woman said, Pray let my lord the king speak.                                              And the
                 king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in this whole bu-
           19 siness? And the woman said to the king, As thy soul liveth,
         XIV.              II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
    Ch.
        my lord the king, there is no turning to the right, nor to the
        left, from all that my lord the king hath spoken ; for thy ser-
        vant Joab commanded me, and he himself pnt all these words
    20 in the mouth of thy servant, that this case might wear the ap-
        pearance of the thing which thy servant Joab wished to have
        clone.  But my lord is wise as an angel of God, to know all the
    21 things on the earth.      Then the king said to Joab, Behold I
        have done for thee according to this thy state of the case ;
    22 bring back the young man, Abessalom.             Upon which Joab
        fell on his face to the ground, and made obeisance, and bless-
        ed the king.    And Joab said, Now thy servant knoweth that I
        have found favour in thy sight, my lord the king, because my
    23 lord the king hath granted the suit of his servant.      Then Joab
        arose and went to Gedsur, and brought Abessalom to Jerusa-
    24 lem.    And the king said, Let him return to his house, and not
        see my face.   So Abessalom returned to his house, and did not
        see the king's face.
     25     Now in all Israel there was not a man so very comely as
        Abessalom.    From the sole of his foot, to the crown of his
    26 head, there was not a blemish in him.         When he polled his
        head, and at the beginning of every year he had it polled, be-
        cause the hair was burthensome to him, and when he polled it
        he weighed the hair of his head, and it weighed two hundred
    27 shekels after the king's shekel.        And to Abessalom there
        were born three sons and one daughter.          The name of his
     23 daughter was Themar.      She was a very beautiful woman.      And
        when Abessalom had dwelt two years at Jerusalem, and saw
     29 not the king's face, Abessalom sent for Joab that he might
        send him to the king, but he declined coming to him.           And
        when he had sent a second time, and he declined coming,
    30 Abessalom said to his servants, See, the portion of land in the
        field adjoining mine is Joab's, and he hath barley there.       Go
        and set it on fire. And when Abessalom's servants set the field
        on fire, the servants of Joab came to him with their clothes
        rent, and said, Abessalom's servants have burned the field
    31 with fire.   Thereupon Joab arose, and went to Abessalom, and
    32 said to him, Why have thy servants set my field on fire ? And
        Abessalom said to Joab, Behold I sent to thee, saying, Come
        here that I may send thee to the king, saying, Why have I
        Ch. XV.             II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
            come from G-edsur ? It was better for me to be there, as I have
            not yet seen the king's face.  If indeed there be wickedness in
        33 me, put me to death.     Then Joab went to the king, and deliv-
            ered him this message, and he sent for Abessalom, and Abes-
           salom went to the king, and made obeisance to him, and pros-
           trated himself on the ground before him, and the king kissed
        XY.      him.   And after this, Abessalom procured for himself
         2 chariots, and horses, and fifty men to run before him.        And
           Abessalom rose early in the morning, and took his stand at
           the place where the road turned off to the gate.        And when
         3 any man who had a controversy came to the king for judg-
           ment, Abessalom called to him, and said, Of what city art
            thou ?  And when he said, Thy servant is of such a one of the
            tribes of Israel, Abessalom said to him, Behold thy cause is
            good, and easily determined, but there is none appointed by
         4 the king to hear thee.      Then would Abessalom say,          that
           they would make me a judge in the land !       In that case if any
            man had a defence to make, or a suit to prosecute, and would
         5 come to me, I would do him justice.      And when any man came
            to make obeisance to him, he stretched forth his hand, and
         6 took him, and kissed him.     In this manner Abessalom acted to
            all Israel who were coming to the king for judgment, so that
         7 Abessalom won the hearts of the men of Israel.         And at the
            end of four years Abessalom said to his father, Let me I pray
            thee go and pay my vows at Chebron, which I vowed to the
         8 Lord. For when I dwelt at Gedsur, in Syria, thy servant vow-
            ed a vow, saying, If the Lord will bring me back to Jerusa-
         9 lem, I will serve the Lord.    And the king said to him, Go in
        10 peace.   So he arose and went to Chebron.         Now Abessalom
            had sent spies through all the tribes of Israel, saying, When
            you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, Abessalom is
        11 king in Chebron.      And there went with Abessalom two hun-
            dred chosen men out of Jerusalem.      They indeed went in their
        12 simplicity, for they knew nothing.       And Abessalom sent for
            Achitophel, the Thekonite, the counsellor of David, from his
            own city, namely, from Gola, while he was sacrificing.     So the
            conspiracy became strong, and the people who came, and they
        13 were many, were with Abessalom.         And there came a mes-
            senger to David, saying, The heart of the men of Israel is gone
    Ch. XV.            II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
    14 after Abessalom.  Upon this David said to all his servants who
       were with him at Jerusalem, Arise and let us flee, for there is
       no safety for us on account of Abessalom.    Make haste to de-
       part, lest he overtake us suddenly, and throw the blame on us,
    15 when he shall smite the city with the edge of the sword.   And
       the king's servants said to the king, Whatever our lord the
    16 king chuseth, behold we thy servants are ready to do.    So the
       king and all his household, set out on foot, and the king left
    17 ten of his concubines to keep the house.   And when the king,
       with all his servants, on foot, had gone out, they halted at the
       farthest house, and all his servants passed on by him, name-
    18 ly, all the Chelethites, and all the Phelethites, and they halted
       near the olive yard, in the wilderness.And all the people pass-
       ed by near him. Now all that were around himâ€”all the nobles,
       and all the warriors, were six hundred men, and while these
       stood by him, all the Chelethites, and all the Phelethites, and
       all the Gethitesâ€”the six hundred men who had come on foot
    19 from Geth, marched on before the king.    And the king said to
       Ethi the Gethite, Why shouldst thou go with us ?         Eeturn
       and dwell with the king; for thou art a stranger, and hast
    20 come as an exile from thy own place.     As thou art come but
       yesterday, shall I to-day cause thee to move with us, and
       change thy abode ?   As for me, I will go where I can ; but re-
       turn thou and take back thy brethren with thee ; and the Lord
    21 will deal mercifully and truly with thee.   And Ethi answered
       the king, and said, As the Lord liveth, and as my lord the
       king liveth, whithersoever my lord goeth, whether to death or
    22 to life, there shall thy servant be.Whereupon the king said to
       Ethi, Come and march with me.      So Ethi, the Gethite march-
       ed on with the king, and all his servants, and all the multitude
    23 who were with him.     And all the country wept with a loud
       voice, while all the people were crossing the brook Kedron.
       And when the king had crossed the brook Kedron, all the
       people, and the king, continued their march by the way to
    24 the wilderness.  Now behold Sadok, and all the Levites,
       were with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord
       from Baithar.   And they set down the ark of God, and Abia-
       thar went up, until all the people had done coming out of the
    25 city.  Then the king said to Sadok, Carry back the ark of
                              II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
        Ch. XVI.
            God into the city.    If I find favour in the sight of the Lord, he
        26 will bring me back, and shew me it and its comeliness.             But
            if he should say, I have no pleasure in thee, behold here am I.
        27 Let him do to me as seemeth good in his sight.               Then the
            king said to Sadok the priest, See ! thou returnest to the city
            in peace ;  and Achimaas, thy son, and Jonathan, the son of
        28 Abiatharâ€”your two sons are with you.          See ! I will encamp at
            Araboth of the wilderness, until a message come from you to
        29 give me intelligence.     So Sadok and Abiathar carried back the
        30 ark of God to Jerusalem, and it abode there.         And David went
           up by the ascent of the olive orchards, weeping as he went up,
           and having his head covered, and walking barefoot.            And all
           the people who were with him covered, every one, his head,
        31 and went up weeping as they went.            And when it was told
            David that Achitophel was among the conspirators with Abes-
            salom, David said, Confound, I beseech thee,               Lord my
        32 God, the counsel of Achitophel.          And David continued his
           march till he came to Eos, where he worshipped God.               And
           behold Chousi, an old companion of David, met him there,
        33 with his clothes rent, and earth on his head.        And David said
        34 to him, If thou go with me, thou wilt be a burden to me : but
           if thou return to the city, and wilt say to Abessalom, Thy
           brothers are gone, and the king thy father is gone, and hath
           left me behind, now therefore, I am thy servant,           king.   Let
           me live.    I have been thy father's servant hitherto ; but now I
           am thy servant : thou mayst baffle for me the counsel of Achi-
        35 tophel.   And behold there are there with thee, Sadok and
           Abiathar, the priests, so that whatever thou mayst hear from
           the king's household thou wilt tell to Sadok and Abiathar, the
        36 priests.  And behold they have there with them their two
           sons Achimaas, son of Sadok, and Jonathan, son of Abiathar,
           so that by them you can send to me every thing you may hear.
        37 Accordingly, Chousi, David's companion, came to the city,
           just as Abessalom was entering Jerusalem.
       XVI.       And when David had marched on a little way from Eos,
           behold Siba, the servant of Mernphibosthe, came out to meet
           him with a couple of asses saddled, and on them two hundred
           loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of dried grapes, and a
         2 hundred bunches of dates, and a nebel of wine.         And the king
                                                                                                                       !
              XVI.                     IT. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
      Ch.
            said to Siba, What meanest thou by these ?                                         To which Siba
            replied, The asses are for the king's family to ride on, and the
            loaves and the dates for the young men to eat, and the wine for
        3 such as are fainty in the wilderness, to drink.                                     Then the king
            said, But where is thy master's son ?                          And Siba said to the king,
            Behold he abideth in Jerusalem ; for he said, Now will the
        4 house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.                                               There-
           upon the king said to Siba, Behold all that belong to Mem-
           phibosthe are thine.                   And Siba having bowed down said, Let
        5 me find favour in thy sight,                             my lord the king.                  And when
           king David was going to Baurim, behold there came out thence
           a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Se-
        6 mei, son of Gera.                   He came out, cursing David as he came,
           and throwing stones at David, and at all the servants of king Da-
           vid.      Now all the people, even all the mighty men, were on the
        7 right and left of the king.                     And in this manner Semei expressed
           himself when he cursed him, Out ! Out ! thou man of blood
       8 thou miscreant !                 The Lord hath retorted on thee all the blood
           of the house of Saul.                    Because thou hast reigned in his stead,
           therefore the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hands
           of Abessalom thy son.                      And behold thou art in distress, be-
        9 cause thou art a bloody man.                             Whereupon Abessa, son of Sa-
           ruia said to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my
           lord the king ? Let me go over, and I will take off his head.
      10 But the king said, What is it to me and you,                                                sons of Sa-
           ruia ? Let him alone, and let him curse on ; for the Lord hath
           told him to curse David, and who shall say Why hast thou
      11 done so?              Then David said to Abessa, and to all his servants,
           Behold my own son, who is descended from my loins, seeketh
           my life, and how much more then may this Jeminite do it ! Let
      12 him curse, for the Lord hath bidden him.                                        Perhaps the Lord
           may look on my affliction, and return me good for his cursing
      13 this day.           So David and all his men proceeded on their march,
            and Semei went along the side of the mountain near him,
           cursing as he went, and throwing stones from the side of it,
      14 and casting up dust.                      And when the king arrived, and all the
            people with him, being fatigued, they refreshed themselves there.
      15         Now Abessalom and all Israel had come to Jerusalem, and
      16 Achitophel with him.                       And when Chousi, the old companion of
                 VOL. I.                                       3 Y
            XVII.          II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
        Ch.
           David, came to Abessaloin, Chousi said to Abessaloro, God
        17 save the king !  Whereupon Abessalom said to Chousi, Is this
           thy kindness for thy friend ? Why hast thou not gone with
        18 thy friend ?  And Chousi said to Abessalom, shall I not follow
           him whom the Lord hath chosen, and this his peopleâ€”even all
        19 Israel ? For him I will be ; and with him I will abide.     And
           in the next place whom should I serve ?    Must it not be before
        20 his son ?  As I have served before thy father, so will I be before
           thee.   Then Abessalom said to Achitophel, Consult among
        21 yourselves what we shall do.    Thereupon Achitophel said to
           Abessalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, whom he
           hath left to keep his house ; and all Israel will hear that thou
           hast dishonoured thy father, and the hands of all who are with
        22 thee will be strengthened.   So they fixed up a tent for Abessa-
           lom on the top of the house, and Abessalom went in unto his
        23 father's concubines, in the sight of all Israel.Now the advice
           which Achitophel gave in those first days, was as if one had
           consulted the oracle of God.    Such was every advice of Achi-
           tophel both with David and with Abessalom.
        XVII.      Then Achitophel said to Abessalom, Let me, I pray
           thee, chuse out for myself twelve thousand men ; and I will arise
         2 and pursue David this very night.   And I will come upon him
           while he is weary, and weak-handed, and surprise him ; so that
           all the people who are with him will flee.  And I will smite the
         3 king alone, and bring all the people back to thee, as a bride re-
           turneth to her husband.   Thou seekest only the life of one man,
         4 therefore all the people may be at peace.   Though this reason-
           ing seemed good in the sight of xibessalom, and in the sight
         5 of all the elders of Israel, yet Abessalom said, Call, I pray you,
         6 Chousi the Arachite, and let us hear also what he saith.    And
           when Chousi came to Abessalom, Abessalom spoke to him say-
           ing, In this manner Achitophel has spoken ; shall we do as he
         7 adviseth ?  If not, speak thou.  Upon this Chousi said to Abes-
           salom, The counsel which Achitophel hath given, is, for this
         8 once, not good.   Thou thyself, said Chousi, knowest thy father
           and his men, that they are very brave, and chafed in their
           minds like a bear bereaved of her whelps in the fields ; or like
           a wild boar in the plain.  And thy father is a man of war, and
           will not let the people rest.For behold he is now hid in one of
         XVTI.           II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
     Ch.
        the mountains, or in some secure place, and it shall be that
        when he shall sally out on them at the first, every one who
        heareth will say, There hath been a slaughter among them
    10 who follow Abessalom : in which case the son of valour him-
        self, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will assuredly be
        dismayed.   For all Israel know that thy father is a mighty man,
    11 and that they who are with him are sons of valour.       This there-
        fore is the counsel which I would give ; Let all Israel be gather-
        ed to thee, from Dan to Bersabee, like the sand which is on the
        sea shore for multitude ; and let thy presence go forth in the
    12 midst of them. And when we shall come upon him in one of the
        places where we may find him, we will encamp around him
        as the dew falleth on the ground.     And we will not leave with
    13 him or the men who are with him so much as one man.             And
        if he be shut up in any city, all Israel will take ropes to that
        city, and we will drag it into the ditch, so that there shall not
        be left so much as a stone.
    14      And Abessalom, and all Israel, said, The counsel of Chousi
        the Arachite is better than the counsel of Achitophel.          For
        the Lord had determined to defeat the counsel of Achitophel,
        which was good, that the Lord might bring upon Abessalom
        all the consequent evils.
    15      Then Chousi, the Arachite, said to Sadok, and Abiathar
        the priests, Thus and thus did Achitophel advise Abessalom
        and the elders of Israel ; and thus and thus I have counselled.
    16 Now therefore send speedily, and tell David and say, Lodge
        not to night at Araboth of the wilderness, but cross with all
        speed.   Perhaps he may prevail with the king and all the peo-
    17 pie who are with him.     Now Jonathan and Achimaas had taken
        their station at the fountain Kogel, and a girl went out, and
        gave them intelligence, and they went and told David, for they
    18 might not be seen entering the city.       But a servant saw them
        and told Abessalom.     Now they two had set out with speed,
        and got to the house of a man at Bakurim, who had a well in
    19 his court and they went down into it, and the woman took and
        spread a covering over the mouth of the well, and laid there-
        on balls of dough to dry ; so that the thing was not known.
    20 And when the servants of Abessalom came to the woman,
        into the house and said, Where are Achimaas and Jonathan ?
                                          II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
           Ch. XY1II.
                The woman said, They went a little while ago over the water.
                And when they had sought, but did not find them, they re-
           21 turned to Jerusalem.                  And when they were gone, Achimaas and
                Jonathan came up out of the well, and went and told king
                David, and said to him, Arise and cross the water with all
                speed :      for thus hath Achitophel counselled concerning you.
           22 Whereupon David arose, and the people who were with him,
                and they crossed the Jordan till the morning light, till there
           23 was not one left, who had not crossed the Jordan.                                      Now when
                Achitophel saw that his advice was not taken, he saddled his
                ass, and arose, and went to his house to his own city, and
                having given orders to his household he strangled himself,
                and died, and was buried in his father's tomb.
           24         And David continued his march to Manaim, and Abes-
           25 salom crossed the Jordan, he and all Israel with him.                                           Now
                Abessalom had set Amessai over the army in the room of
                Joab.       Amessai was the son of a man whose name was Jether.
                He was a Jezraelite, and had married Abigaia, a daughter
           26 of Naas, and a sister of Saruia the mother of Joab.                                        And all
                Israel with Abessalom encamped in the land of Galaad.
           27         Now when David came to Manaim, Ovesbi, son of Naas
                                                                                                                    ?
                of Kabbath of the Ammonites, and Machir, son of Amiel of
           28 Lodabar, and Berzelli, the Galaadite of Kogellim, brought ten
                beds of double tapestry, and ten kettles and vessels of earthen
                ware, and wheat, and barley, and fine flour, and meal, and
                beans, and lentils, and honey, and butter, and sheep, and curd-
           29 led milk of kine, and presented them to David, and to the
                people who were with him, to eat.                           For they said, The people
           XVIII.             must be hungry and weary in the wilderness.                                      And
                when David had reviewed the people who were with him,
                 and set over them captains of thousands, and captains of hun-
             2 dreds, he sent forth the people, one third under the command of
                 Joab ; and one third under the command of Abessa, the son of
             3 Saruia, and brother of Joab, and one third under the command
                 of Ethi the Gethite. And David said to the people, I myselfwill
                 go out with you.              But they said, Thou must not go out.                         For if
                 we should flee they will pay no regard to us ; for if one half of
                 us should die, they will not care for us : for thou art worth ten
                 thousand of us.            Now therefore it is best that thou shouldst be
     Ch. XVIII.           II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
      4 in the city to succour and help us.  And the king said, Whatever
         seemeth best in your eyes I will do.  So the king stood by the
         side of the gate, and when all the people were marching out by
      5 hundreds, and by thousands, the king gave a charge to Joab, and
         to Abessa, and to Ethi saying, Spare, for my sake, the young
         man Abessalom.    And all the people heard the king giving this
      6 charge to all the commanders respecting Abessalom.       And all
         the people went out to the forest, in front of Israel, and the battle
      7 was fought in the forest of Ephraim, and Israel there gave way
         before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter
      8 that day, to the amount of twenty thousand men. For the battle
         was there scattered over the whole face of the ground, and the fo-
         rest devoured mure of the people than the sword destroyed that
      9 day.   xVnd as Abessalom was advancing to meet the servants of
        David, being mounted on his mule, his mule entered the thick-
         est copse of that great oak forest, and his head got entangled
         among the oaks so that he was suspended between heaven and
     10 earth, and the mule went from under him.         And a man saw
         him, and told Joab, and said, Behold I saw Abessalom hang-
     11 ing among the oaks.    Whereupon Joab said to the man who told
         him, And behold thou sawest !    Why didst thou not smite him
        there to the ground ; and I would have given thee ten pieces
     12 of silver, and a girdle ?  And the man said, As I live, though I
        might have a thousand shekels of silver weighed into my hands,
        I would not lay my hands on the king's son.     For in our hear-
        ing the king charged thee, and Abessa, and Ethi, saying, Spare,
        for my sake, the young man Abessalom; touch not his life.
     13 Now nothing can be hid from the king.         Even thou thyself
     14 wouldst stand aloof.   And Joab said, I myself will in this case,
        set the example.   I will not boggle so in thy sight.  Then Joab
        took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through Abessa-
         lom's heart, while he was still alive in the heart of the forest.
     15 And when the ten young men, who carried Juab's arms, had
     16 surrounded and smitten Abessalom, and put him to death, Juab
         sounded the trumpet, and the people returned frum pursuing
     17 Israel ; fur Juab had mercy on the people.    And he tuuk Abes-
         salum, and threw him intu a great chasm in the furest, intu the
         great pit, and piled ever him a great heap of stones.    And all
     18 Israel fled every man to his tent. Now Abessalom had, in his life
       Ch. XVIII.           II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
           time, undertaken and erected for himself a monument in which
           he was to have been buried.      So he erected this monument to
           supply the place of that in the king's dale, because, said he, he
           hath no son to keep up the remembrance of his name.          And he
           called that monument, The hand of Abessalom, which name
       19 it retaineth to this day.   Then Achimaas son of Sadok said, Let
           me, I pray thee, run and tell the king good news, That the Lord
       20 hath delivered him out of the hand of his enemies.          But Joab
           said to him, Thou wilt not be the messenger of good news to-
           day.   At another time thou shalt carry good news.     But this day
           thou canst not be the messenger of good news, because the
       21 king's son is dead.    Then Joab said to Chousi, Kun and tell the
           king what thou hast seen.      Whereupon Chousi bowed to Joab
       22 and set out.    And Achimaas, son of Sadok, applied again, and
           said to Joab, Grant me leave that I also may run after Chousi.
           And Joab said, Why art thou so earnest to run, my son ? Come,
       23 there is no good news worth thy going.       And he said, But what
           if I can run ?   Then Joab said to him, Kun.       So Achimaas ran
       24 by the way leading to Kechar, and passed Chousi.          Now David
           was sitting between the two gates, and the watchman went up
           to the top of the gate, to the wall, and raising his eyes he looked
       25 and behold there was a man in his view running alone.         So the
           watchman cried, and told the king.       And the king said, If he
       26 be alone, there is good news in his mouth.         While he was ad-
           vancing, and coming near, the watchman saw another man run-
           ning, whereupon the watchman cried to the gate, and said, Be-
           hold there is another man running alone.       And the king said,
       27 He also is a messenger of good news.        And the watchman said,
           I see the running of the foremost is like the running of Achimaas
           son of Sadok.   And the king said, He is a good man, and must
       28 therefore come with good news.         Then Achimaas cried aloud,
           and said to the king, All is well.   And when he had made obei-
           sance to the king, with his face to the ground, he said, Blessed be
           the Lord thy God, who hath delivered up the men who lifted their
       29 hands against my lord the king.         Then the king said, Is the
           young man Abessalom safe ?       And Achimaas said, I saw a great
           crowd when Joab the king's servant despatched thy servant, but
       30 I did not know what was there.      Then the king said, Turn aside,
           and stand here.    And when he turned aside, and took his sta-
                                                                                                     !

       31 tion, behold Chousi came, and said to the king, Good news
             to my lord the king ; for the Lord hath this day delivered thee
       32 out of the hand of all who rose up against thee.                                        And the king
             said to Chousi, Is the young man Abessalom safe ?                                        And Chousi
             said, May all the enemies of my lord the king, and all who have
       33 risen against him for evil, be as that young man.                                          At this the
             king was much moved, and went up to the chamber, over the
             gate, and wept.                And as he was going up he thus expressed
             himself, Oh, my son, Abessalom !                            Oh ! my son ! my son Abes-
             salom !              that they had slain me instead of theeâ€”that I had
             died in thy stead ! Oh Abessalom ! my son ! my son
       XIX.             When they told Joab the news, saying, Behold the king
         2 is weeping, and mourning for Abessalom, so that the joy of
         3 the day is turned into sorrow to all the people, (For the peo-
             ple that day heard it said, that the king was in grief for his son,
             therefore the people were stealing into the city that day, as
             people do who are ashamed, when they flee in battle, and the
         4 king hid his face) therefore when the king cried with a loud
             voice saying, Oh ! my son Abessalom ! Oh ! Abessalom my son !
         5 Joab went to the king, into the house, and said, Thou hast this
             day put to shame the faces of all thy servants, who have this
             day delivered thee, and saved the lives of thy sons, and the
             lives of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and thy con-
         6 cubines ; by thy loving those who hate thee, and hating those
             who love thee.                  Thou hast indeed this day declared, that
             thou regardest neither thy officers, nor thy servants; for I am
             now convinced, that if Abessalom were alive, and we were
         7 now all dead, then all would be right in thine eyes.                                                   Now
             therefore arise, and go out, and speak affectionately to thy ser-
             vants ; for I have sworn by the Lord, that if thou go not out
             immediately, there will not a man lodge with thee this night.
             And be assured that this will be worse for thee than all the evil
         8 that hath befallen thee, from thy youth even till now.                                         Then the
             king arose, and sat in the gate.                           And when all the people pro-
             claimed the news, saying, Behold the king is sitting in the gate,
             then all the people entered the gate, in the presence of the king.
         9           Now when all Israel had fled, every man to his tent, all the
             people throughout all the tribes of Israel began to condemn
             themselves, saying, King David delivered us from all our
            XTX.           II. KINGS-II. SAMUEL.
       Ch.
          enemies.   Though he delivered us out of the hands of the Phi-
          listines, yet he hath now fled from the land, and from his king-
       10 clom, and from Abessalom.      But Abessalom whom we anoint-
           ed over us is dead in battle, now therefore, why are you silent
          about bringing the king back ?     When this saying of all Israel
       11 came to the king, king David sent to Sadok, and to Abiathar
          the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Juda, and say, Why
          are you the last to bring the king back to his house ?       The
          speech indeed of all Israel is come to the king, that he should
       12 return to his house.  You are my brethren ; you are my bones,
          and my flesh.   Why are you the last to bring the king back to
       13 his house ?   And to Amessai you shall say, Art not thou my
          bone and my flesh ?    Now therefore, God do so to me and more
          also, if thou shalt not be captain general of the army before
       14 me continually, in the room of Joab.     So when he had turned
          the heart of Juda, like that of one man, they sent to the king,
       15 saying, Keturn thou and all thy servants.    So the king set out
          on his return, and came to the Jordan.     And the men of Juda
          came to Galgala, to go and meet the king, and conduct him
       16 over the Jordan.     And Semei, son of Gera the Jeminite, of
          Baurim, hastened and came down with the men of Juda, to
       17 meet king David; and with him were a thousand men from
          Benjamin, and Siba the servant of the house of Saul, with his
          fifteen sons, and his twenty servants, and they acted as guides
          across the Jordan, before the king, and performed the service
       18 of bringing the king over.    And when the raft went over to
          bring the king's household, and to do what was right io his
          sight, Semei son of Gera fell on his face before the king, while
       19 he was crossing the Jordan, and said to the king, Let not my
          lord, I pray thee, impute to me my transgression ; nor call to
          remembrance what thy servant did perversely, on the clay
          when my lord went out of Jerusalem, that the king should lay
       20 it to heart.  Because thy servant was conscious that he had
          sinned, therefore behold I am come, the first of all Israel, and
          of the house of Joseph, in coming down to meet my lord the
       21 king.  To this Abessa son of Saruia, answered and said, Shall
          not Semei be put to death, because he cursed the anointed of
       22 the Lord?    But David said, What have you to do with me,
          ye sons of Saruia, that you are now laying snares for me ?
    Ch. XIX.             II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
       There shall not a man of Israel be this day put to death.    For
    23 I do not yet know whether I am king over Israel.        Then the
       king said to Semei, Thou shalt not die.     And the king swore
    24 to him.   Memphibosthe also, the grandson of Saul, came down
       to meet the king.   Now he had not dressed his feet, nor pared
       his nails, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from
       the day the king went away, to the day he returned, in peace.
    25 And when he came to Jerusalem, and waited on the king, and
       the king said to him, Why diclst thou not go with me, Mem-
    26 phibosthe?    Memphibosthe said to the king,        my lord the
       king, my servant deceived me.     For thy servant said to him,
       Saddle me the ass, that I may mount thereon and go with the
    27 king.   (For thy servant is lame.)  But he acted deceitfully with
       thy servant, before my lord the king.    But my lord the king is
       as an angel of God.     Do therefore what is good in thy sight.
    28 For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord
       the king, yet thou didst set thy servant among them who eat
       at thy table.  What right then have I to cry any more to the
    29 king ?   And the king said to him, What need of more words.
    30 I have said, Thou and Siba shall divide the fields.  Whereupon
       Memphibosthe said to the king, Nay, let him take all, seeing
       my lord the king is returned to his house in peace.
    31     Berzelli, the Galaadite, also   came down from Kogellim,
       and crossed the Jordan with the king, to convoy him over the
    32 Jordan.   Now Berzelli was a very old man, being then eighty
       years of age, and he had supplied the king and his household
       with provisions at Manaim, for he was a very wealthy man.
    33 When the king said to Berzelli, Thou shalt come over with
    34 me, that I may nourish thy old age with me at Jerusalem ; Ber-
       zelli said to the king, How many can the days of the years of
    35 my life be, that I should go with the king to Jerusalem ?   I am
       now eighty years of age.     Can I distinguish between good and
       evil ?  Can thy servant any more relish what I eat or drink ?
        Or can I any more hear the voice of singing men or singing
       women ?    Why then should thy servant be a burthen to my
    36 lord the king ?   Thy servant will go a little way across the Jor-
        dan with the king ; but why should the king make me such a
    37 recompence ?    Let thy servant, I pray thee, stay, that I may die
        in my own city, near the tomb of my father and mother.      And
           vol. i.                   3 z

             behold thy servant Chamaani shall go over with my lord the
         38 king.    Do to him what is good in thy sight. And the king said,
             Let Chamaam come over with me, and I will do for him what
             is good in my sight, and whatever thou requirest of me, I will
         39 do for thee.     Now all the people had crossed the Jordan, and
             when the king had crossed, he kissed Berzelli, and bade him
         40 farewell, and he returned to his place ; and the king proceeded
             on to Gralgala, and Chamaam went with him.
              Now when all the tribe of Juda, and about half of the people
         41 of Israel, were advancing with the king, behold all Israel came
             to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brethren, the
             men of Juda, stolen thee away, and brought the king and his
             household over the Jordan ?        Are all the men of David indeed
         42 with him ?     And all the men of Juda answered the men of Is-
             rael, and said, Because the king is near of kin to us, why
             should you be so angry at this matter ?        Have we eaten at the
             king's cost ?   Or hath he given us any gifts, or borne any bur-
         43 then for us ?    And the men of Israel answered the men of Ju-
             da, and said, We have ten votes for the king, and we are elder
             than you, therefore we have more interest in David than you.
             Why then have you affronted us, and why was not our opinion
             taken before that of Juda, to bring the king back ?          Then the
             words of the men of Juda were fiercer than the words of the
         XX.       men of Israel; and there happened to be there a turbu-
             lent man whose name was Sabee, son of Bochori, the chief of
             the Jeminites, and he sounded a trumpet, and said, We have
             no portion in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jessai. Every
          2 man to his tent,       Israel.   Thereupon all Israel went up from
             following David, after Sabee, son of Bochori.        But the men of
             Juda kept close by their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
          3 And when David came to his house at Jerusalem, the king
             took the ten women, his concubines, whom he had left to keep
             the house, and sent them to a house of confinement, and fed
          4 them, but did not go in to them.          So they were kept confined
             to the day of their death, living as widows.
                 Then the kiug said to Ainessai, Assemble for me all the
          5 men of Juda, and be thou here in three days.         So Amessai went
             to assemble the men of Juda, but he tarried beyond the time
          6 which David set for him.          Thereupon David said to Abessa
        XX.            II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
   Oh.
      Now will Sabee, son of Bochori do us more harm than Abes-
      salom.   Now therefore take thou with thee the servants of thy
      lord, and pursue him, lest he secure for himself cities of de-
    7 fence, that he may escape our notice.    So there went out after
      him, Abessa's men, and Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and
    8 the Phelethites, and all the mighty men.     And when they had
       marched out of Jerusalem in pursuit of Sabee, son of Bochori,
      and were come to the great heap of stones at Gabaon, Ames-
      sai came in before them.    Now Joab had a military robe girded
       on for his dress, and over it he was girt with a sword on his
    9 thigh in its sheath, and the sword dropped out.         But as it
       dropped out and fell, therefore when Joab said to Amessai,
       art thou well my brother ? and with his right hand took hold of
       Amessai's beard to kiss it, Amessai did not attend to the
   10 sword which was in Joab's hand.      So Joab smote him with it
       into the belly, and his bowels gushed out on the ground, so
       that he did not repeat the blow.  And while he was dying, Joab
   11 and Abessa, his brother, pursued after Sabee, son of Bochori,
       and there stood by him one of the servants of Joab, who said,
       Whoever is for Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow
   12 Joab.    Now Amessai was weltering in his blood in the middle
       of the road.  And when the man saw that all the people halted,
       he drew Amessai out of the road, into the field, and threw a
       mantle over him, because he saw that all the people who came
   13 up stood still.  And when-he had removed him out of the road,
       then all the men of Israel proceeded on after Joab, in pursuit
   14 of Sabee, son of Bochori.    Now he had passed through all the
       tribes of Israel to Abel and Bethmacha, and all the men at
   15 Charri had assembled and gone after him.        And when they
       came up with him they formed a siege against him in Abel
       and Bethmacha.     And when they had levelled the bank before
       the city, and were got within the out works, and all the people
   16 who were with Joab, were labouring to throw down the wall,
       a wise woman cried with a loud voice from the wall, and said,
       Hear! Hear! Say, I pray you, to Joab, Come near hither
   17 that I may speak to him.     And when he drew near to her, the
       woman said, Art thou Joab?    And he said, I am.   Then she said
       to him, Hear the words of thy servant.    And when Joab said, I
    18 am hearkening, then she continued her speech, and said, They
                                                                                                                   !
          Ch. XXI.                       II KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
                used heretofore to state an accusation, saying, He who is ex-
                amined hath been examined both in Abel and Dan.                                            If the
                liege men of Israel have been guilty of what is laid to their
                charge, let the examiners in Abel inquire in like manner
          19 whether they have been guilty.                           For my part I am for observ-
                ing strictly the customs of Israel, which tend to peace; but
                thou art seeking to destroy a cityâ€”a mother city in Israel.
                Why wouldst thou swallow up an inheritance of the Lord ?
          20 In answer to which Joab said, Mercy on me ! Mercy on me
          21 Am I for swallowing up ?                        Am I for destroying ?                 Is not this
                the case ?          There is a man of mount Ephraimâ€”his name is
                Sabee son of Bochori, who hath lifted up his hand against
                king David.           Only deliver him up to me, and I will depart
          22 from the city.                And the woman said, Behold his head shall
                be thrown to thee over the wall.                          So the woman went to all
                the people.          And when she had spoken to the whole city in
                her wisdom, they cut off the head of Sabee son of Bochori.
                And having cut it off, they threw it to Joab ; whereupon Joab
                sounded a trumpet, and all the people withdrew from the city,
                and dispersed, every man to his tent, and Joab returned to Je-
                rusalem to the king.
          23         Now Joab was over all the host of Israel, and Banaias son
                of Jodae was over the Cherethites and the Phelethites, and
                Adoniram was over the tribute, and Josaphat son of Achiluth
                was recorder, and Susa was scribe, and Sadok and Abiathar
                were priests, and Iras the son of Jarim was priest for David.
          XXL             In the days of David there was a famine three years,
                year after year successively ; whereupon David applied to the
                Lord, and the Lord said, On Saul and on his house be the ini-
                quity, by the death of his descendants, because he put to death
            2 the Gabaonites.               Now the Gabaonites are not of the children of
                Israel, but a remnant of the Amorites, and the children of Israel
                had sworn to them ; but Saul sought occasion to smite them,
                when he was courting popularity with the children of Israel and
            3 Juda.         So king David sent for the Gabaonites, and said to
                them, What shall I do for you ; and by what means can I make
                atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of the Lord ?
            4 And the Gabaonites said to him, We have no controversy
                with Saul and his household, about gold or silver, nor is it

     5 for us to put to death a man in Israel.     And the king said,
       What do you say, I must do for you?       And they said to the
       king, The man who set himself against us, and persecuted us,
       and who formed pretences to exterminate us, him let us destroy,
     6 that he may not rise up in all the borders of Israel.   Give us
       seven men of his sons, and let us crucify to the Lord at Gabaon
       those of Saul who are the choice of the Lord.     And the king
     7 said, I will give them. But the king had compassion on Mem-
       phibosthe, the son of Jonathan, Saul's son, on account of the
       oath of the Lord between themâ€”namely between David and
     8 Jonathan, Saul's son.  So the king took the two sons of Respha,
       the daughter of Aia, whom she bore to Saul, namely Ermoni
       and Memphibosthe, and the five sons of Michol the daughter
       of Saul, whom she bore to Esdriel, the son of Berzelli, the
       Mooulothite, and delivered them into the hands of the Ga-
       baonites, and they crucified them on the mount before the
     9 Lord.   So these seven fell together.   Now they were put to
       death in the days of the harvest of first fruits, in the beginning
    10 of the barley harvest.    And Respha, the daughter of Aia,
       took sackcloth, and fixed it up for herself, before the rock, in
       the beginning of the barley harvest, until water from heaven
       dropped upon them ; and she suffered not the birds of the
       air to rest upon them by day, nor the beasts of the field by
    11 night.   AYhen David was told what Respha the daughter of
       Aia   Saul's  concubine  had   doneâ€”(now they were wasted
       away, and Dan son of Joa, of the race of the giants had taken
    12 them down.)    David went, and took the tbones of Saul, and
       the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of Jabis Galaad,
       who had stolen them from the street of Baithsan, where the
       Philistines had fixed them on the day when the Philistines
    13 smote Saul at Gelbua ; and having brought thence the bones of
       Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, he gathered up the bones
    14 of them who had been crucified.     And they buried the bones
       of Saul and the bones of Jonathan, and the bones of them who
       were crucified, in the land of Benjamin, on the one side, in the
       tomb of his father Kis.  And when they had done all that the
       king commanded, God, after that, hearkened to the land.
    15     There was also another battle between the Philistines and Is-
       rael.  David, and his servants with him, went down and fought
                                                                                             ;     â€”â€”â€”â€”                      ;
                 XXII.                      II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
          Oh.
          16 the Philistines.                 And as David was advancing, Jesbi, who was
                of the race of Kapha, and the weight of whose spear was three
                hundred shekels, brass weight, and who was clad in armour,
          17 thought to have smitten David ; but Abessa, son of Saruia,
                came to his assistance, and smote the Philistine, and killed
                him.        Then David's men swore, saying, Thou shalt not go
                out with us any more to battle, lest thou extinguish the lamp
                of Israel.
          18          And after this there was another battle, at Geth, with the
                Philistines, in which Sobocha the Astatothite smote Seph, one
                of the descendants of Kapha.
          19          There was also a battle with the Philistines at Kom, when
                Eleanan son of Ariorgim the Bethlemite, smote Lachmi, the
                brother of Goliath the Gethite, the staff of whose spear was
                like a weaver's beam.
          20          There was also another battle at Geth, and there was a
                smooth man who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes
                on each foot, twenty four in all, and he was a descendant of
          21 Kapha, and defied Israel, but Jonathan son of Semei, David's
           22 brother, smote him.                     These four descendants of the giants were
                born at Geth, and were of the house of Kapha, and they fell
                by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
           XXII.              And David addressed the Lord in the words of this
                ode : on the day the Lord delivered him out of the hands of
                 all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul, he said in a psalm
             2                 Lord, Thou art my rock and my fortress.
                       It is he who delivered me ; he shall be my God.
             3         He will be my guard, in him I will trust
                       He is my defence, and the horn of my salvation
                       My helper and my refuge for safety.
                       From an unrighteous man thou wilt save me.
             4         On the Lord, who is praiseworthy, I will call,
                       And I shall be saved from mine enemies.
             5         Because troubles of death have surrounded me
                       Floods of iniquity have filled me with horror
             6         The pangs of death have compassed me about
                       The bitterness of death hath invaded me.
             7         In my distress I will call on the Lord,
                       And to my God I will cry aloud.
          1                                                â€”                 ;        â€”â€”â€”;
              XXII.                  II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
       Oh.
                  From his holy temple he will hear my voice,
                  My cry will certainly reach his ears.
         8           The earth indeed was shakenâ€”it trembled
                  The fountains of heaven were convulsed, and quivered,
                  Because the Lord was incensed.
         9        At his indignation a smoke ascended,
                  A fire from his mouth devoureth.
                  By it coals are kindled to a glow.
       10         He bowed the heavens and came down,
                  And darkness was under his feet.
       11         He sat on the cherubim, and flew,
                  And appeared on the wings of wind.
       12         But he made darkness his covering ;
                  His pavilion around him was darkness of waters
                  He condensed it with clouds of air.
        13        From the flashing lightning before him
                  Flaming fires were kindled.
        14        The Lord thundered from heaven,
                  The Most High uttered his voice.
        15        He sent forth his bolts and scattered them :
                  He darted his lightning, and confounded them.
        16        Then were seen the outlets of the sea ;
                  And the foundations of the earth were disclosed,
                  At the rebuke of the Lord
                  At the blast of the breath of his anger.
        17            He sent from on high and took me
                   He drew me out of many waters :
        18         He delivered me from mine enemies' strength
                   From them who hated me ;
                   Because they were stronger than I.
        19            The days of my distress came on me unawares,
                   But the Lord was my firm support,
        20         And brought me out to a roomy place,
                   And delivered me, because he delighted in me.
        2             The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness ;
                   According to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me
        22         Because I kept the ways of the Lord,
                   And did not wickedly depart from my God
        23         Because all his judgments were before me,
                                       â€”                                                   ;     ;       ;
                    XXII.                    II. KINGSâ€”II.
             Ch.                                                            SAMUEL.
                         And from his statutes I did not depart
             24         I therefore shall be blameless before him,
                        And I will guard myself from my iniquity
             25         And the Lord will reward me according to my righteous-
                                ness
                        According to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
            26          With the beneficent thou wilt shew thyself beneficent,
                        With an upright man thou wilt deal uprightly.
             27          With a warrior thou wilt be a warrior,
                        And with the wily thou wilt practice wiles.
            28          Thou wilt save the people who are dejected,
                        But lofty countenances thou wilt bring down.
             29              Because thou,               Lord, art my lamp,
                         Therefore the Lord will illume my darkness.
            30           For by thee I can run like an honoured soldier,
                        And overleap walls by the help of my God.
             31             He is mighty whose way is blameless.
                         The Word of the Lord is strongâ€”is tried.
                        He is the defender of all them who trust in him
            32              Who is mighty, besides the Lord ?
                        Who can build up, but our God ?
             33         He who strengthened me is the Mighty One,
                         He hath cleared my way which is blameless.
             34              Thou makest my feet like the feet of hinds,
                        And steadiest me on the high places.
             35          Thou instructest my hands for battle,
                         And hast by my arm broken the bow of steel.
             36              Thou hast given me a guard for my safety ;
                        And thy attention hath enabled me
             37          To enlarge my steps under me,
                        So that my feet have not slipped.
             38              I shall pursue my enemies and destroy them,
                         And will not turn back till I consume them.
             39          I will break them so that they shall not rise,
                         When they shall have fallen under my feet.
             40          For thou wilt gird me with strength for battle,
                         And bend under me my antagonists.
             41              Thou hast given me the back of my enemies
                         And them who hate me thou hast put to death.
                                               â€”â€”â€” ;
        XXIII.            II. KINGSâ€”II. SAMUEL.
    Oh.
    42     They may cry aloud but there is no help
           To the Lord, but he will not answer them.
    43       I beat them small as the dust of the earth ;
           I trampled them like the dirt of highways.
    44     From the tumult of tribes thou wilt save me ;
           Thou wilt keep me to be the head of nations.
    45       A people which I knew not shall be my slaves,
           Strangers have yielded me feigned obedience.
           Soon as they heard they became submissive.
    46     Strange children shall be exposed to contempt
           They shall tumble down from their places of defence.
    47       Live the Lord ! and blessed be he, my guard !
           Let my God, my safeguard, be exalted
    48     The mighty Lord, who is my avenger.
           Who chastiseth the people under me,
           Who leadeth me out from my enemies.
    49     From them who are stirred up against me
             Thou wilt raise me up.
           From the man of violence, thou wilt deliver me.
    50     For this cause I will give thee thanks,     Lord, among the
                nations.
           I will sing melodiously to thy name.
    51     He is magnifying the deliverances of his own king,
           And shewing mercy to his anointed
             To David and his seed forever.
    XXIII.      Now these were the last words of David.
           Faithful is David the son of Jessai,
           And faithful the man whom the Lord hath set
           Over the anointed of the God of Jacob.
           And sweet are the psalms of Israel.
     2       The Spirit of the Lord hath spoken by me,
           And his word was upon my tongue.
     3     The God of Israel saith to me,
           A watchman of Israel hath spoken a proverb.
                  I said as a man,
       (d) How can you strengthen the fear of an anointed ?
     4 (p) With the light of the God of the morning.
                         (d) David.     (p) Prophet.

             Ch.
                  (d) Let the Sun rise in trie morning betimes.
                   (p) Is not the Lord gone forth with splendour ?
                  (d) Yes, like the spring of grass on the earth after rain ;
               5         For is not my house thus with the Almighty ?
                         For he hath made with me an everlasting covenant,
                         Kept ready for every occasion
                         Because this is all my safety, and all my desire,
                         That the transgressor may not nourish.
               6 (p)        All such are like rejected thorns.
                         Because they cannot be handled,
               7         Nor can a man labour among them ;
                         Therefore pure iron, and the staff of a spear,
                         Shall cause them to burn with fire,
                         And they shall be burned to their shame.
               8                     These are the names of David's worthies.
                         Jebosthe, the Chananite, a chief of the third rank, who is
                   also called Adinon the Asonite.                                This man drew his sword
               9 against eight hundred warriors at one time.                                          And after him
                   Eleanon (the son of a man who married his brother's wife to
                   raise up seed for his brother) the son of Dudi, one of the three
                   worthies with David.                   When he challenged the Philistines, and
                  they had assembled for battle, and the men of Israel had gone
             10 up, he arose and made a slaughter among the Philistines, till
                  his hand was tired, and glued to his sword, and the Lord
                  wrought a great deliverance that day, and the people went after
             11 him only to spoil.                   And next to him was Samaias, son of Asa
                   the Aruchite.             When the Philistines had assembled to forage,
                  where there was a piece of ground full of lentils, and the peo-
             12 pie fled before the Philistines ; he stood like a pillar in the mid-
                   dle of the field, and defended it, and smote the Philistines, and
             13 the Lord wrought a great deliverance.                                  These three went down
                  from the thirty, and came to David at Kason, to the cave of
                   Odollam, when an army of the Philistines was encamped in the
             14 valley of Kaphain.                     Now David was then in the fortress, and
             15 there was a garrison of the Philistines then at Bethlehem.                                              And
                  David longed and said, Oh that I had some water to drink out
             16 of the well which is at Bethlehemâ€”that by the gate !                                                  Upon

           Philistines then at Bethlehem, broke through the camp of the
            Philistines, and drew water out of the well at Bethlehem, by
            the gate.      But when they got it, and came to David, he would
           not drink it, but poured it out as a libation to the Lord, and
       17 said, Lord forbid that I should do this.                    Shall I drink the blood
           of these men, who have gone at the risk of their lives ?                            So he
           would not drink it.              These exploits were performed by these
      18 three men.           Now Abessa, the brother of Joab, son of Saruia,
           was a chief among the three.                He also lifted up his spear against
           three hundred men, though he was wounded.                                 So he had a
      19 name among the three ; and being higher in rank than any of
           the three, he became their chief, though he did not come up to
           those three.        Banaias also, son of Jodae, of Kabeseel, was a man
           renowned for exploits.               He smote the two sons of Ariel the
           Moabite.        He went down also, and smote a lion in the midst of
      21 the pit on a snowy day.                He smote also an Egyptian, a man of
           great stature.        Though the Egyptian had in his hand a spear
           like the side of a ladder, he went down to him with a staff, and
           wresting the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, he killed
      22 him with his own spear.                  These exploits Banaias son of Jodae
      23 performed, and had a name among the three worthies.                                 He was
           higher in rank than any of the three, though he did not come
      24 up to the three.             And David appointed him Auditor.                         These
           also were the names of king David's worthies, Asael the bro-
           ther of Joab, he was among the thirty, Eleanon son of Dudi,
      25 who married his brother's wife at Bethlehem ; Saima the Kud-
      26 ite ; Selles the Kelothite ; Iras of Iska, the Thekoite ; Abiezer
           the Anothite, another of the sons of the Anothites ; Ellon the
           Aoite ; Neere the Netophatite ; Esthai son of Kiba of Gabaoth ;
           son of Benjamin the Ephrathite ; Asmoth the Bardiamite
            Emasu the Salabonite ; son Asan ; son Jonathan ; Samnan the
           Aradite ; Amnan son of Arai the Saraourite ; xiliphaleth son of
           Asbites ; son of the Machachite ; Eliab son of Achitophel the
           Gelonite ; Asarai the Karmelite, of Ouraioerchi ; Gaal son of
           Nathana ; Poludunameos son of Galaaddi ; Elie the Ammonite ;
           Adroi of the brooks; Gadabiel son of the Arabothite; Gelore

            XXIY.               Again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Is-
              2 rael, when one among them over persuaded David, saying,
                  Go number Israel and Juda.
                         When the king said to Joab, the captain general of his army,
                  who was with him, Go, I pray thee through all the tribes of Israel
                  and Juda, from Dan to Bersabee, and review the people, and
              3 let me know the number of them, Joab said to the king, The
                  Lord God add to the people, how many soever they be, a hun-
                  dred fold ; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it ! But why
              4 doth my lord the king set his mind upon this ?                                                    But the word
                  of the king prevailed against Joab, and the officers of the army.
                  So Joab and the chiefs of the army before the king, went out
              5 to review the people, Israel.                              And they crossed the Jordan, and
                  encamped at Aroer on the right of the city, in the valley of
             6 Gad and Eliezer.                         Then they went to Galaad, and to the land
              7 of Thabason, which is Adasai, and came to Danidan and Ou-
                  dan ; and having gone round Sidon, and come to Mapsar of
                  Tyre, and to all the cities of the Evites, and the Chananites,
             8 they came to the south of Juda to Bersabee.                                                So when they had
                  gone round through all the land, they came to Jerusalem, at
              9 the end of nine months and twenty days.                                                 And Joab laid be-
                  fore the king the amount of the review of the people.                                                            And
                  that of Israel was eight hundred thousand fighting men : and
            10 the men of Juda were five hundred thousand warriors.                                                                And
                  David's heart smote him after this numbering of the people
                   and David said to the Lord, I have sinned greatly in what I
                  have done.                Now therefore,                       Lord, forgive, I beseech thee,
                  the iniquity of thy servant, for I have acted very foolishly.
            11 And when David arose in the morning, a word of the Lord
                  came to the prophet Gad, the seer, saying, Go and speak to Da-
            12 vid, and say, Thus saith the Lord, Three things I am ready
                   to bring upon thee, chuse therefore for thyself one of them,
            13 that I may do it to thee.                                So Gad went to David, and deliver-
                   ed the message, and said, Chuse what shall be done to thee.
                   Shall three years of famine come on all thy land ?                                               Or wilt thou
                   flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee ?
                   Or shall there be three days of pestilence in thy land ?                                                        Now
                   therefore consider ; and see what answer I shall make to him
             14 who sent me.                      Thereupon David said to Gad, I am in great

       straits on every side. Pray let me fall into the hands of the
       Lord ; for very many and great are his mercies.   But let me
    15 not fall into the hands of men.   Now when David chose for
       himself the pestilence, it was the time of the wheat harvest.
       And the Lord sent a pestilence through Israel, from the morn-
       ing till the hour of dining.  And the slaughter began among
       the people, and there died of the people from Dan to Bersa-
    16 bee, seventy thousand men.     But when the angel of God
       stretched forth his hand against Jerusalem to destroy it, the
       Lord was moved with compassion at the calamity, and said to
       the angel who was making havock among the people, It is
       enough.   Stay thy hand.  Now the angel of the Lord was by
    17 the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite.   And when David
       saw the angel who was smiting the people, he addressed the
       Lord, and said, Behold here am I who have transgressed!
       But as for this flock, what have they done ?  Let thy hand, I
    18 pray thee, be upon me, and upon my father's house.       Then
       Gad came to David that day, and said to him, Go up and erect
       an altar for the Lord, on the threshing floor of Orna the Jebu-
    19 site. So David went up according to the word of Gad, as the
    20 Lord had commanded him.      And when Orna looked out, and
       saw the king and his servants coming up to him, he went out
       and bowed down to the king, with his face to the ground, and
    21 said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant ?  And Da-
       vid said, To purchase of thee this threshing floor to build an
       altar to the Lord, that the slaughter among the people may be
    22 stayed.  Then Orna said to David, Let my lord the king take,
       and offer to the Lord what is agreeable to him.   Behold here
       are cattle for a whole burnt offering, and the carts and the
    23 yokes of the cattle for fuel.All these Orna hath given to the
       king.  And may the Lord thy God, said Orna addressing the
    24 king, bless thee. But the king said to Orna, No.  Let me only
       purchase them of thee for their full value ; for I cannot offer to
       the Lord my God a whole burnt offering which costeth me
       nothing.   So David purchased the threshing floor, and the
    25 cattle, for fifty shekels of silver.And David built there an
       altar to the Lord, and offered whole burnt offerings and peace
       offerings.  Now Solomon afterwards enlarged this altar; for
       at first it was small.  Thus the Lord was entreated for the
       land, and the slaughter was stopped from Israel.

        I.    When king David was oldâ€”far advanced in years, they
         2 covered him with clothes, but he was not warmed ; therefore
           his servants said, Let a young virgin be sought out for the
           king, that she may attend him, and chafe him, and lie in his
         3 bosom, that my lord the king may be warmed.        So they sought
           for a beautiful virgin, through all the borders of Israel, and
           having found Abisag, the Somanite, they brought her to the
         4 king.   The young woman was indeed very beautiful, and she
           chafed the king, and waited on him, but the king knew her not.
         5     Then Adonias, son of Aggith, took upon him state, say-
           ing, I shall be king; and provided himself with chariots, and
         6 horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.         And his father
           did not in the least restrain him nor say, Why hast thou done
           so ?  Now in person he was very comely, and by birth next
         7 after Abessalom.    And his plans were concerted with Joab,
           son of Saruia, and with Abiathar, the priest, and they abetted
        8 him.    But Sadok the priest, and Banaias, son of Jodae, and
           Nathan the prophet, and Semei, and Kesi, and the worthies of
        9 David, were not of his party.      So having slain sheep, and ox-
           en, and lambs, at the fires of Zaelethi, which is near Kogel,
           Adonias invited all his brothers, and all the nobles of Juda,
       10 the king's servants ; but did not invite Nathan the prophet, nor
       11 Banaias, nor the worthies, nor Solomon his brother.          There-
           upon Nathan spoke to Bersabe, the mother of Solomon, say-
           ing, Hast thou not heard that Adonias, son of Aggith, doth
       12 reign, and David our lord knoweth it not ?          Now therefore
           come, I pray thee, let me advise thee.    Save thine own life, and
       13 the life of thy son Solomon.      Go immediately to king David,
           and say to him, Didst thou not,       my lord the king, swear to
           thy servant saying, Thy son Solomon shall reign after me, and
       14 he shall sit on my throne ?      Why then doth Adonias reign ?
           And behold whilst thou art speaking with the king, I will
       15 come in after thee, and confirm thy words.        So Bersabe went
           to the king, into the inner chamber.     Now the king was very
       16 old, and Abisag the Somanite was waiting on him.         And when
           Bersabe had bowed down, and made obeisance to the king,
       17 the king said to her, What is thy will?         And she said, My
          lord, Thou didst swear to thy servant, by the Lord thy God,
          saying, Thy son Solomon shall reign after me, and sit on my
     Cb. I.                 III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
     18 throne.    But now behold Adonias reigneth, and thou my lord
     19 the king dost not know it.       He hath sacrificed oxen, and lambs,
         and sheep for the multitude, and invited all the king's sons,
         and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain general of the
     20 army, but hath not invited thy servant Solomon.            Now there-
         fore my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, to
         tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after
     21 him ; otherwise when my lord the king shall sleep with his fa-
     22 thers, I, and Solomon my son, shall be deemed offenders.           And
         behold while she was yet speaking to the king, Nathan the
         prophet came, and was announced to the king, Here is Nathan
     23 the prophet.    And when he came into the king's presence, and
         had made obeisance to the king, with his face to the ground,
     24 Nathan said, My lord the king, hast thou said, Adonias shall
     25 reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne ?        For he is gone
         down to-day, and hath sacrificed bullocks, and lambs, and sheep,
         for the multitude, and invited all the king's sons, and the chiefs
     26 of the army, and Abiathar the priest, and behold they are eat-
         ing and drinking in his presence, and have said, Long live
         king Adonias.     But me thy servant, and Saclok the priest, and
         Banaias, son of Jodae, and Solomon thy servant, he hath not
     27 invited.   If this is done by order of my lord the king, why hast
         thou not made known to thy servant who shall sit on the throne
     28 of my lord the king after him ?       And king David in reply said,
         Call Bersabe to me.       And when she came in before the king,
     29 and stood in his presence, the king swore, saying, As the
         Lord liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all affliction,
     .Â°>0as I have sworn to thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying,
         Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my
     31 throne in my stead, even so will I do this very day.       Thereupon
        Bersabe bowed down, with her face to the ground, and made
        obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for-
     32 ever.   Then king David said, Call to me Sadok the priest, and
     33 Nathan the prophet, and Banaias, son of Jodae.        And when they
         came in before the king, he said to them, Take the servants of
        your lord the king with you, and mount my son Solomon on
     34 my mule, and conduct him down to Gion, and let Sadok the
        priest, and Nathan the prophet, anoint him to be king over Is-
     35 rael.   Then sound the trumpet, and say, God save king Solo-
                                                                                                                                            !

                    mon.         And let him sit on my throne, and reign in my stead, as
             36 I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Juda.                                                           There-
                    upon Banaias, son of Jodae, answered the king and said, Be it
                    so !      May the Lord the God of my lord the king confirm it
             37 As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, so may he be
                    with Solomon, and magnify his throne above the throne of my
             38 lord king David !                       Then Sadok the priest, and Nathan the pro-
                    phet, and Banaias, son of Jodae, went down with the Chere-
                    thites, and the Phelethites, and having mounted Solomon on
             39 king David's mule, they conducted him to Gion.                                                         And Sadok
                   the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and having
                    anointed Solomon, he blew the trumpet, and all the people
             40 shouted, Live king Solomon!                                        Then all the people followed
                   him up, and danced in choirs, and made great rejoicings, so
             41 that the earth was rent with their shouting.                                               And Adonias, and
                   all his guests, heard it just as they had done eating.                                                 And when
             *~     Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, What is this
             42 sound of the city in an uproar ? And while he was speaking, be-
                   hold Jonathan, son of Abiathar the priest, entered.                                                    And Ado-
                   nias said, Come in, for thou art a man of valour, and must have
             43 brought good news.                            To which Jonathan replied, saying, Quite
             44 the reverse.                   Our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
                    The king sent with him Sadok the priest, and Nathan the pro-
                    phet, and Banaias son of Jodae, and the Cherethites and the
             45 Phelethites, and they mounted him on the king's mule.                                                                And
                    Sadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, anointed him at Gi-
                    on, and all the people went up thence rejoicing, so that the city
             46 resounded.                  This is the noise which you have heard.                                      And while
             47 Solomon sat on the throne of the kingdom, the king's ser-
                    vants went in to congratulate our lord king David, saying, God
                   make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and magni-
                    fy his throne above thy throne ! And the king bowed on his bed.
             48 And the king said to this effect.                                       Blessed be the Lord God of
                    Israel, who hath this day set one of my seed on my throne, and my
             49 eyes see it. Upon this all the guests of Adonias, were struck with
             50 consternation, and went every man his way, And Adonias, being
                    afraid of Solomon, arose and went, and took hold of the horns
             51 of the altar. And when they told Solomon, saying, Behold Ado-
                    nias is afraid of king Solomon, and hath hold of the horns of
                    the altar, saying, Let Solomon this day swear to me that he
                                                                   â€”
    Ch. II.             III. KINGS-I. KINGS.
    52 will not slay his servant with the sword, Solomon said, If he
       shew himself a virtuous man, there shall not a hair of him fall
       to the ground ; but if wickedness be found in him he shall be
    53 put to death. Then king Solomon sent, and they brought him
       down from the altar ; and when he came, and had done homage
       to king Solomon, Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.
   II.     Now when David's days drew near that he should die, he
     2 spoke to his son Solomon, and said, I am going the way of all
     3 the earth, be thou therefore strong, and shew thyself a man, and
       keep the watch of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and
       keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments,
       which are written in the law of Moses ; that thou mayest know
     4 what thou art to do, according to all that I command thee
       that the Lord may establish his word which he hath spoken,
       saying, If thy children take heed to their ways, to walk before
       me in truth, with their whole heart, thou shalt not, said he,
     5 have a man cut off from the throne of Israel. Now thou thyself
       knowest what Joab son of Saruia hath done to meâ€”what he
       did to the two chiefs of the armies of Israel, to Abenner son of
       Ner, and to Amessai son of Jether.   He indeed slew them, and
       shed the blood of war in peace, and stained, with guiltless
     6 blood, the girdle on his loins, and the shoes on his feet.  Do
       thou therefore according to thy wisdom, so as not to let his
     7 grey hairs go down to the grave in peace.   But shew kindness
       to the sons of Berzelli, the Galaadite, and let them eat at thy
       table ; for so they were near me, when I fled from the face of
       thy brother Abessalom.
     8    Behold also thou hast with thee Semei, sonIof Gera, the
       Jeminite of Baurim.   Though he cursed me with a bitter curse
       on the day when I was marching to Camps, yet he came down
       to the Jordan to meet me, and I swore to him by the Lord,
     9 saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword. Now thou
       art not to hold him guiltless.   As thou art a wise man, thou
       thyself therefore wilt know what to do to him, and wilt bring
       down his grey hairs to the grave with blood.
    10     Then David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
    11 city of David.  Now all the days which David reigned over Is-
       rael were forty years. He reigned seven years at Chebron, and
       thirty three years at Jerusalem.

       Ch. II.
       12    When Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and
       13 his kingdom was well established ; Adonias, son of Aggith,
          went to Bersabe, the mother of Solomon, and bowed to her.
       14 Whereupon she said to him, Is thy coming peaceable ?   And
          he said, It is peaceable.I have something to say to thee.And
       15 she said to him, Say on. Then he said to her, Thou knowest
          that the kingdom belonged to me, and that all Israel looked on
          me as king.   But the kingdom is transferred, and become my
          brother's, because it was his from the Lord.Now therefore I
       16 have a favour to ask of thee, do not refuse it.And Bersabe
       17 said to him, Proceed. Then he said to her, Speak, I pray thee
          to Solomon, for he will not refuse thee, that he may give me
       18 Abisag, the Somanite, for a wife.   Thereupon Bersabe said,
       19 Well, I will speak to the king for thee.So Bersabe went to
          king Solomon, to speak to him concerning Adonias.  And the
          king arose to meet her, and saluted her, and when he sat down
          on the throne, there was a throne set for the king's mother, and
       20 she sat on his right hand, and said to him, I have a small fa-
          vour to ask of thee, do not refuse me.Andthe kingsaid to her,
       21 Ask it, my mother, I will not reject thee.Then she said, I pray
          thee, let Abisag, the Somanite, be given to thy brother Ado-
       22 nias for a wife.Whereupon king Solomon in reply to his mo-
          ther, said, But why hast thou asked Abisag for Adonias ?Ask
          for him the kingdom also ; for he is my elder brother, and
          Abiathar is his priest, and Joab, son of Saruia, his captain ge-
       23 neral, and his friend.Then king Solomon swore by the Lord,
          saying, God do so to me and more also, if Adonias hath not
       24 spoken this against his own life. Now therefore as the Lord
          liveth, who hath prepared me, and set me on the throne of my
          father David, and hath made for me a house, as he hath spoken,
       25 Adonias shall this day be put to death.So king Solomon sent
       26 by the hand of Banaias, son of Jodae, and he slew him. And
           when Adonias was dead, on the very same day, the king said
           to Abiathar, Begone speedily to thy fields at Anathoth, for thou
           art this day a condemned man, but I will not put thee to death,
           because thou didst carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord
           before my father, and hast shared in all the afflictions with
        27 which my father was afflicted.So Solomon expelled Abiathar
           from being the priest of the Lord, so that the word of the Lord
    Ch. III.          III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
       was fulfilled, which he spoke against the house of Eli at
    28 Selom.  Now when the news came to Joab, son of Saruia, be-
       cause he had been of Adonias' party, and not a follower of So-
       lomon, therefore Joab fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and
    29 took hold of the horns of the altar.And when they told Solo-
       mon, saying, Joab hath fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and
       behold he hath hold of the horns of the altar, king Solomon
       sent to Joab, saying, What is the matter with thee, that thou
       hast fled to the altar.Thereupon Joab said, Because I was
       afraid of thee, therefore I fled to the Lord.Then Solomon sent
       Banaias, son of Jodae, saying, Go, and kill him, and bury him.
    oO So Banaias, son of Jodae, went to Joab, to the tabernacle of
       the Lord, and said to him, Thus saith the king, Come out.
       And Joab said, I will not go out, for I will die here.Upon
       which Banaias, son of Jodae, returned and told the king, say-
    31 ing, Thus did Joab say, and thus he answered me ; and the
       king said to him, Go and do to him as he hath spoken.  Kill
       him, and bury him, and take away this day, the blood which
    32 he shed without cause, from me and my father's house.  The
       Lord indeed hath turned the blood of his iniquity on his head.
       Because he fell upon two men more righteous, and better than
       himself, and slew them with the sword, and my father David
       knew not of their blood, namely Abenner, son of Ner, the
       captain general of Israel, and Amessai, son of Jether, the cap-
    33 tain general of Juda ; therefore their blood is returned on his
       own head, and on the head of his seed forever.But on David,
       and his seed, and on his house, and his throne, let there be
    34 peace from the Lord forever.So Banaias, son of Jodae, went up,
       and fell upon Joab ; and when he had slain him, he buried him,
    35 at his house in the wilderness; and the king set Banaias, son
        of Jodae, over the army in his stead.
    III.    Now the regal government was established at Jerusalem,
        and the king made Sadok the priest, the first priest, in the
        room of Abiathar.  And Solomon, son of David, reigned over
        Israel and Juda at Jerusalem.  And the Lord gave Solomon
        understanding, and comprehensive wisdom, and an enlarge-
        ment of heart, like the sand on the sea shore ; so that the know-
        ledge of Solomon was enlarged far above the knowledge of all
        the ancients, and above all the wise men of Egypt. And he took
            II.             III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
       Ch.
           the daughter of Pharao, and brought her to the city of David,
           until he finished building his own house, and the house of the
           Lord, which he did first, and also the wall of Jerusalem round
           about.  These he began, and finished in seven years ; for he
           had seventy thousand men who carried burdens, and eighty
           thousand hewers of stone on the mountains.        And Solomon
           made the sea, and its supporters, and the great lavers, and the
           pillars, and the fountain in the court. And over the brazen sea
           he built the turreted shelter for it, and cut a canal through the
           city of David.   And when Pharao's daughter went up out of
           the city of David into her house, which he had built for her, he
           then built the citadel. And Solomon offered, every year, three
           whole burnt offerings, and peace offerings, on the altar which
           he built for the Lord, and he burned incense before the Lord,
           and finished the house.  Now the chiefs who were set over the
           works of Solomon were three thousand six hundred.          They
           superintended the people who performed the works.      He built
           also Assour, and Magdo, and Gazer, and upper Baithoron, and
           Ballath.  But this was after he had built the house of the Lord,
           and the wall of Jerusalem round about.      After finishing these
           he built the cities above mentioned.
               Now while David was still alive he gave a charge to Solo-
           mon, saying, Behold thou hast with thee Semei, son of Gera,
           a descendant of the seed of Jemini of Chebron.    He cursed me
           with a bitter curse when I was marching to Camps.        But he
           came down to the Jordan to meet me, therefore I swore to him
           by the Lord saying, Thou shalt not be put to death with the
           sword.  Now thou art not to hold him guiltless.   As thou art a
           wise man thou thyself therefore wilt know what to do to him,
           and wilt bring down his grey hairs to the grave with blood.
        36 Therefore the king sent for Semei, and said to him, Build thy-
           self a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and thou shalt not
        37 go out thence any where.   For be assured that on the day thou
           goest out, and crossest the brook Kedron, thou shalt be put to
           death.  Thy blood shall be on thy own head.       And the king
        38 caused him to take an oath that day.     And Semei said to the
           king, Good is the word which thou my lord the king hast spo-
           ken.   Thy servant will do so.  Accordingly Semei dwelt in Je-
        39 rusalem three years. But it happened, that after the three years,
                                                                                                       ;
             II.                     III. KINGS-I. KINGS.
      Ch.
            two slaves of Semei ran away to Angchus son of Maacha king
           of Geth.        And when Semei was told that his slaves were at
           Geth, he arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Geth to Ang-
      40 chus to seek them.              And when he had gone, and brought them
      41 back from Geth, Solomon was informed that Semei had gone
      42 from Jerusalem to Geth, and brought back his slaves.                                   Upon
           which the king sent for Semei, and said to him, Did I not ad-
           jure thee by the Lord, and protest to thee saying, Be assured
           that on the day thou goest out of Jerusalem to any place what-
      43 ever thou shalt surely die ?                Why then hast thou not kept the
           oath of the Lord, and the command which I enjoined thee ?
      44 Moreover the king said to Semei, Thou knowest all thy wick-
           edness, and thy heart is privy to all that thou didst to my father
           David, therefore the Lord hath turned thy wickedness on thy
      45 own head ; and king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne
      46 of David shall be established before the Lord forever.                                 Then
           king Solomon gave orders to Banaias, son of Jodae, and he
           went and slew him.
                Now king Solomon was very prudent and wise ; and Juda
      46 and Israel were exceedingly numerous, like the sand on the
           sea shore for multitude, eating, and drinking, and rejoicing.
           And Solomon was chief among all the kingdoms, and they
           brought him gifts, and served him all the days of his life.                           And
           Solomon began opening the fastnesses of Libanus, and he built
           Thermai in the wilderness.               And this was Solomon's allowance
           for dinner, thirty cores of fine flour, and sixty cores of barley
           meal ; ten beeves stall fed, and twenty beeves from the pasture,
           and one hundred sheep, besides hinds, fallow deer, and choice
           fatted fowls ; for he was supreme over all the country on this
           side the river, from Raphi to Gaza, over all the kings border-
           ing on the river, and he was at peace with all around him ; so
           that Juda and Israel dwelt securely, every one under his own
           vine and under his own fig tree, eating and drinking, and feast-
           ing, from Dan to Bersabee, all the days of Solomon.                           And these
           were Solomon's principal officers, Azarias son of Sadok was
           priest, and Ornias son of Nathan was chief over the overseers
           and Edramen was steward ; and Suba scribe, and Basa son of
           Achithalam, recorder, and Abi son of Joab, captain general of
           the army ; and Achire son of Edrai was at the head of the board
                                                                                                                              ;
            Ch. III.                            III. KINGS-1. KINGS.
                  of works ; and Banaias son of Jodae was captain of the guards
                  and Kashur son of Nathan, counsellor.                                  And Solomon had four
                  thousand breeding mares for carriages, and twelve thousand
                  horses.        And he was supreme over all the kings from the river
                  to the land of the Philistines, and even to the borders of Egypt.
            III.          Now Solomon son of David reigned over Israel and Juda
                  in Jerusalem ; but the people were in the practice of burning
                  incense on the high places, because till this time there was not
              3 a house built to the Lord.                           And Solomon loved the Lord, to
                  walk in the statutes of his father David ; but he sacrificed and
              4 burned incense on the high places.                                 So he arose and went to
                  Gabaon because it was the highest and greatest to sacrifice
                  there.        And when Solomon had offered there a whole burnt of-
                  fering of a thousand victims upon the altar of Gabaon, the Lord
              5 appeared to him that night in a dream, and said to him, Ask
              6 for thyself any favour.                        Thereupon Solomon said, Thou hast
                  shewn great kindness to thy servant David my father.                                                As he
                  walked before thee in truth and righteousness and in upright-
                  ness of heart with thee, thou therefore hast kept for him this
              7 great kindness to set his son on his throne as at this day.                                             Now
                  therefore,            Lord my God, as thou hast appointed me thy ser-
                  vant in the room of my father David, and I am but a little child
              8 and know not how to go out and come in, and thy servant is
                  in the midst of thy people whom thou hast chosen, an immense
               9 people which cannot be numbered, give therefore to thy ser-
                   vant a heart to hear and to judge thy people righteously, and to
                   discern between good and evil ; for who can judge this thy peo-
             10 pie, this great people which is so numerous ?                                        And it was well
                  pleasing in the sight of the Lord that Solomon made this re-
             11 quest ; therefore the Lord said to him, Because thou hast asked
                   this of me, and hast not asked for thyself many days, nor riches,
                   nor the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself under-
                   standing to discern judgment, behold I have granted thy re-
             12 questâ€”behold I have given thee a wise and understanding
                   heart, so that before thee there hath not been one like thee, nor
             13 after thee shall there arise one like thee.                               Moreover I have given
                   thee what thou didst not ask, riches and glory ; so that there
             14 hath not been among kings a man like thee.                                         And if thou wilt
                   walk in my ways to keep my commandments and my statutes,
                            III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
    Ch. IV.
        as thy father David did, I will also multiply thy days.            And
    15 Solomon awoke, and behold it was a dream.           Then he arose and
        came to Jerusalem, and stood before the altar which is in front
        of the ark of the covenant of the Lord in Sion, and offered
        whole burnt offerings; and having offered also offerings of
        thanksgiving, he made a great entertainment for himself and
    1(3 all his servants.   Then there appeared before the king two wo-
        men who were harlots, and when they stood in his presence
    17 one of them said, Hear me, my lord, I and this woman dwell
        in one house, and we were delivered of children in the same
    18 house.     And it happened that the third day after my delivery
        this woman was delivered.          We were together.       There is no
    19 body with usâ€”none but we two in the house.                And this wo-
    20 man's son died in the night, as she overlaid it.          And she arose
        in the middle of the night, and took my son out of my arms,
        and laid it in her bosom ; and her own child which was dead,
    21 she laid in my bosom.       So when I arose in the morning to give
        my son suck, behold it was dead.          But when I examined it at-
        tentively in the morning, behold it was not my son whom I
    22 bore.    And the other woman said, No : but the living is my
    23 son and the dead is thy son.       And when both had spoken before
        the king, he said to them, Thou sayst, This is my child which
        is alive, and that which is dead is that woman's child.             And
        thou sayst, No : but the living is my son, and the dead is thy
     24 son.   Then the king said, Bring me a sword.           And when they
     25 had laid the sword before the king, he said, Divide the living
         childâ€”the infant, in two ; and give one half to this woman and
     26 the other half to that woman.        Upon this the woman whose son
        the living child really was, answered and said to the kingâ€”be-
         cause her bowels yearned for her son, therefore she said, I be-
     27 seech thee my lord, Give her the child.       Donot kill it.    But the
         other said, Let it be neither mine nor hers.         Divide it.   Then
         the king answered and said, Give the child to her who said,
         Give the child to her and do not kill it ; For she is the mother.
     28 And when all Israel heard the judgment which the king had
         given, they feared the king, for they saw that there was in him
         the wisdom of God to execute judgment.
     IV.      Now when king Solomon reigned over Israel these were
         his principal officers.  Azarias son of Saclok, Eliaph and Achia
                                                                                                                     ;
            Ch. IV.                          III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
                  sons of Seba were scribes, and Josaphat son of Achilud recorder
                  and Banaias son of Jodae captain general of the army, and Sa-
                  dok and Abiathar chief priests ; and Ornia son of Nathan su-
                 perintendant of the overseers ; and Zabuth son of Nathan the
              6 king's companion, and Achisar was steward ; and Eliak high
                 steward ; and Eliab son of Saph was over the household ; and
              7 Adoniram son of Audon was over the tribute.                                      And Solomon
                 had twelve officers over all Israel to supply the king and his
                 household, each to furnish supplies one month in the year,
             8 and these were their names.                      Been son ofOr on mount Ephraim,
             9 one.        Son Dakar, at Makis, and at Salabin, and at Baithsamys,
            10 and Elon even to Bethanon, another.                               Son Esdi at Araboth ;
            11 to him belonged Socho and all the land of Opher.                                        And over
                 all    Nephador was son Aminadab, who had to wife Tephath,
           12 a daughter of Solomon, another.                             Bana son of Achiluth had
                 Ithanach and Mageddo and all the house of San, which is by
                 Sephanan below Esrae, and from Bethsan to Sabelmaula even
           13 to Maeberlukam, another.                       Son Naber at Kaboth Galaad ; he
                 had the district of Ergab in Basan, containing sixty large
           14 cities with walls and brasen bars, another.                                Achinadab son of
           15 Saddo at Maanaim.                      Achiniaas,         who married Basemmath a
           16 daughter of Solomon, was in Nephthaleim, another.                                              Bana
           18 son of Chousi in Asser and in Baaloth, another.                                        Semei son
           19 of Ela in Benjamin.                  Gaber son of Adai in the land of Gad,
                which belonged to Seon king of Esebon and Og king of Ba-
           17 san, and Naseph, one ; in the land ofJuda ; Josaphat son of Phaa-
           27 sud in Issachar.                These officers thus stationed furnished sup-
                plies for king Solomon, and all things ordered for the king's
                table, each his month, without the least variation from what
           28 was ordered.             The barley and straw, for the horses and chariot
                mares, they carried to the place where the king hapiDened to
           22 be, each in his course.                      Now these were the stated portions
                for Solomon every day, thirty cores of fine flour and sixty
           23 cores of barley meal ;                   ten choice young beeves, and twenty
                beeves from the pasture, and one hundred sheep besides hinds
           2-1 and fallow deer, and fatted fowls ; for he was supreme on this
           29 side the river, and was at peace with all around.                                And the Lord
                gave Solomon understanding and very comprehensive know-
                ledge ; and the effusions of his heart were like the sand on the
     Ch. V.                         III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
     30 sea shore ; so that Solomon far excelled the wisdom of all the
     31 ancients and all the wise men of Egypt.                               He gave specimens
          of wisdom beyond all menâ€”far beyond Gaithan the Zarite,
     32 and Ainan, and Chelkad and Darala, the sons of Mai.                                           He
          uttered three thousand parables, and his odes were five thou-
     33 sand.        He spoke of trees from the cedar which is on Lebanon,
          to the hyssop which springeth out of the wall.                             He spoke also
     34 of cattle, and of fowls, and of reptiles, and of fishes.                                   And
          there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and
          from all the kings of the earth who heard the fame thereof.
          And Solomon took to wife the daughter of Pharao, and brought
          her to the city of David until he built the house of the Lord,
          and his own house, and the wall of Jerusalem : and Pharao
          king of Egypt, came up and took Gazer, and burned it, and
         subdued the Chananites who dwelt in Mergab, and gave them
         as a portion to his daughter, Solomon's wife, and Solomon
          rebuilt Gazer.
    V.         When Chiram king of Tyre sent his servants to anoint So-
         lomon in the room of his father David, because Chiram con-
         tinued to love David all his days, therefore Solomon sent to
      2 Chiram saying, Thou knowest that my father could not build
      3 a house to the name of the Lord my God, on account of the
         wars with those around him on every side, until the Lord put
     4 them under the soles of his feet.                         But now the Lord my God
         hath given me rest round about.                     I have no adversary, nor any
      "> evil occurrence.          Therefore I propose to build a house for the
         name of the Lord my God; as the Lord my God spoke to
         my father David, saying, Thy son, whom I will set on thy
     G throne in thy stead, shall build the house to my name.                                     Now
         therefore give orders, and let timber be cut for me from Li-
         banus; and behold my servants shall be with thy servants,
         and I will pay thee such hire for the service as thou shalt ap-
         point : for thou knowest that we have none skilled in hewino-
     7 timber like the Sidonians.                   And when Chiram heard the words
        of Solomon he was exceedingly glad, and said, Blessed be
        God this day who hath given David a prudent son over this
     8 great people.           Then he sent to Solomon saying, I have consi-
        dered all that thou hast proposed to me, and I will execute all
     9 thy pleasure.            With respect to the cedar, and fir timber, my
             vol. i,                              4 c
          Ch. VI.                 III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
              servants shall bring it down from Libanus to the sea ; and I
              will send it in rafts to the place which thou shalt appoint, and
              land it there that thou rnayst take it away.           And thou wilt
              accomplish my pleasure in supplying my household with bread.
          10 So Chiram furnished Solomon with cedar and fir timber to
          11 his utmost wish.        And Solomon gave Chiram, twenty thou-
              sand cores of wheat for his household, and twenty thousand
          12 baths of expressed oil.       This Solomon gave to Chiram every
              year.  And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom as he said to him.
              And there was peace between Chiram and Solomon and they
          13 made a league between them.         And the king made a levy out
         14 of all Israel, and the levy was thirty thousand men.               These
             he sent to Libanus, ten thousand every month, by turns, so
             that they were one month at Libanus, and two at home.               And
         15 Adoniram was over this levy.             And Solomon had seventy
             thousand men who carried burdens, and eighty thousand hew-
         16 ers of stone, in the mountains, exclusive of the officers who
             superintended the works of Solomon, and who amounted to
         17 three thousand six hundred.         And these workmen were three
             years preparing the stone and the timber.
         VI.      Now in the four hundred and fortieth year of the depar-
             ture of the Israelites out of Egypt, in the fourth year and
         17 second month of king Solomon's reign over Israel, the king
             having given orders for bringing great costly stones for the
         18 foundation of the house, even hewn stones; and the men or
             Solomon and those of Chiram having hewn them, they began
          1 laying them.      In the fourth year he laid the foundation of the
         38 house of the Lord, in the month of Ziu, which is the second
             month, and in the eleventh year, in the month Baal, which
             is the eighth month, the house with all its appendages was
             completely finished.
          2      Now the house which i^the king built for the Lord, was
             forty cubits iu length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twen-
          3 ty five cubits in height.    And the Ailam in front of the temple
             was twenty cubits in length commensurate with the breadth
          1 of the house.    And when he had built the house, and finished
          5 it he made windows for the house, wide within and narrow
             without and placed against the wall of the house, galleries all
          6 around the temple and the dabir.          The lower gallery was five
                        III. KINGS-L KINGS.
    Ch. VI.
       cubits broad, and the middle six, and the third seven cubits
       broad ; for he made ledges to the house, all around on the out-
       side of the house that the beams might not be fastened into
     7 the walls of the house. Now the house when building was built
       with white hewn stones, so that not a mallet nor ahammer nor any
       instrument of iron was heard in the house while it was build-
     8 ing.  The entrance into the lower gallery was under the right
       shoulder of the house ; and there were winding stairs up to the
     9 middle and from the middle to the third gallery.   And when
       he had compleated the building of the house he wainscotted
    10 it with cedar. And having built the binding walls through
       the whole house to the height of five cubits, he connected the
    15 binding walls with cedar beams.   And having lined the walls
       of the house on the inside with planks of cedar, from the ground
       floor of the house up the walls and to the beams, and vaulted
       the ceiling on the inside with beams, he covered the floor of
    16 the house with planks of fir.  And he built up the twenty cu-
       bits from the end wall as one compartment from the floor to
       the beams, and made of that the dabirâ€”the holy of holies;
    17 (the temple being forty cubits, the front of the dabir was in
   18 the middle of the house on the inside) to put there the ark of
   20 the covenant of the Lord.    The length of this compartment
       was twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, and the
   21 height twenty cubits, and he covered it with plated gold.When
       he had made the altar in front of the dabir and overlaid it with
       gold, he covered all this compartment with gold at the com-
   23 plete finishing of the whole house.  And in the dabir, he made
   24 two cherubim ;   ten cubits the exact magnitude, and five cu-
       bits the wing of one cherubim, and five cubits its other wing,
       making ten cubits from the tip of one wing, to the tip of the
   25 other wing.    And so in respect to the other cherubim.    In
   26 measure and workmanship, they were both alike.     The height
       of the one cherubim was ten cubits, and that of the other che-
   27 rubim was the same.     And both the cherubim were in the
      middle of the innermost house, and they spread their wings so
      that a wing of one cherubim touched one wall, and a wins; of
      the other cherubim touched the other wall, and their wings
   28 touched one another in the middle of the house.  And he over-
   29 laid the cherubim with gold, and engraved all the walls of the
        Ch. VII.            III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
            house round about with engravings of cherubim and palm
        30 trees, both in the inner and outer apartment. And he overlaid
            the floor both of the inner and outer apartment with gold.
        31 And for the entrance into the dabir he made doors of juniper
        34 wood.    The four cheeks for both the doors were of fir, and
           each door consisted of two leaves which turned each on its
        35 own hinges.    And the doors were carved with cherubim and
            palm trees and open leaves, and covered with gold fitted to the
        36 carving.  He built also the inner court with three rows of hewn
           stone, and one row of cedar beams ; and he made the curtain
           for the court of the porch of the house which was in the front
           of the temple.
        VII.     Now king Solomon had sent and brought from Tyre a
        14 widow's son named Chimin.     He was of the tribe of Nephtha-
           leim, though his father was a Tyrian.     He was a worker in
           brass, a complete artist, filled with understanding and know-
           ledge to execute all kinds of brass work.  So he was brought
        15 to king Solomon, and executed all his works.      He cast two
           pillars for the ailam [or porch] of the house : The height of
           each pillar was eighteen cubits, and the circumference there-
        16 of fourteen cubits, and the flutings four fingers.And he cast
           two chapiters to be put on the tops of the pillars ; the height
        17 of each chapiter was five cubits.  He made also two pieces of
           net work to cover the chapiters of the pillars ; one piece of net
        IS work for each chapiter.   They were a pensile work, with two
           rows of brass pomegranates in the form of netting, a pensile
        21 work, row above row.    And he set up the two pillars in the
           ailam of the temple.    And when he set up the one pillar he
           called its name Jachum ; and when he set up the other pillar
        22 he called its name Boloz.   And on the capitals of the pillars
            there was a lilly work of four cubits, towards the ailam, and
            a projected ledge over the two pillars, and this ledge by its
        23 thickness was a covering above the sides.    He made also the
            sea, ten cubits from brim to brim, uniformly round, all about.
            It was five cubits high and thirty three cubits in circum-
        24 ference.  Under its brim, embossments surrounded it, ten to a
            cubit all around. And the brim of it was like the workmanship
        25 of the brim of a cup, with lilly buds.  And its thickness was
            a hand breadth.  And under the sea were twelve beeves, three
                                                                     â€”
                          III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
      Ch. VII.
         looking to the north, and three looking to the west., and three
         looking to the south, and three looking to the east, and all their
         hinder parts were inward, and the sea was above upon them.
     27 And he made ten mechonoths [cisterns] of brass, five cubits
         the length of one mechonoth, and four cubits the breadth, and
     28 six cubits the height.   And the mechonoths had all the same
         kind of engraved borders, and there were engravings between
         the prominences ; and on their engraved parts between the
     29 prominences were lions, and beeves, and cherubim; and on
         the embossments, above and below the lions and beeves, were
     30 fields in bass relief.And each mechonoth had four wheels of
         brass, and the naves were of brass, and at their four corners
     31 there were shoulders under the cisterns, for the axles of the
     32 wheels to each mechonoth.      And the height of each wheel
     33 was a cubit and a half.    And the workmanship of the wheels
         was like that of the wheels of a chariot ; and their axles and
     34 their felloes and their spokes were all cast.   As to the four
         shoulders at the four corners of each mechonoth, the shoul-
     35 ders were a part of the mechonoth itself.   And on the top of
         the mechonoth there was a cylindrical border, of half a cubit
         broad, round about on the top of the mechonoth; and it was
         the beginning of its handles and its engravings ; and there was
     36 a cock at the ends of its handles. And the sculptures thereon
         the cherubim, and the lions, and the palm trees, were in re-
     37 lievo, each being smooth on the inside all around.      In the
         same manner he made all the ten mechonoths, they being all
     38 of the same form and measure.    He made also ten large pots of
         brass, each pot containing forty baths, and measuring four cu-
     39 bits.  A large pot for every one of the ten mechonoths. And he
         placed five mechonoths at the right corner of the house, and
      40 five at the left corner of the house, and the sea was at the right
         corner, southward, facing the east. Chiram made also the ket-
         tles and the cauldrons and the basons.   Thus Chiram finished
     41 completely all these works which he made for king Solomon
         for the house of the Lord, namely, the two pillars, and the
         wreathed works of the pillars on the chapiters of the two pillars,
         and the two pieces of net work to cover the wreaths of the
      42 coverings which were on the pillars, the four hundred pome-
         granates on the two pieces of net work, there being two rows
                               III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
        Ch. VII.
           of pomegranates to each piece of net work for covering the
       43 wreaths of the chapiters on the two pillars ; and the ten mecho-
       44 noths, with the ten large pots for the mechonoths; and the
       45 sea with the twelve beeves under the sea ; and the kettles, and
           the cauldrons, and the bowls, and all the utensils which he
           made for king Solomon for the house of the Lord.              Now the
           pillars for the house of the king, and for the house of the Lord,
           were in all forty eight.      All these works of the king, Chiram
       47 made entirely of brass.        There was no weighing the brass of
           which he made all these works.          On account of the immense
           quantity there was no computation of the weight of the brass.
       46 These he cast on the bank of the Jordan, in the clay ground,
       48 between Sokkoth and Seira.         And Solomon the king took the
           utensils which he made for the house of the Lord, the golden
           altar, and the table of gold on which was to be laid the shew
       49 bread, and the five candlesticks on the left, and five on their
           right in front of the dabir, which were of beaten gold, and the
       50 lamp-stands with the lamps, and the snuffers, which were al-
           so of gold, and the doors with the nails, and the cups, and the
           dishes, and the censers, which were of gold and embossed,
           and the leaves of the doors of the inner houseâ€”the holy of
           holies, and the doors of the temple which were overlaid with
       51 gold.     And when all the work was finished which Solomon
           made for the house of the Lord, then Solomon brought the de-
           dications of his father David, and his own dedications, the sil-
           ver and the gold, and the utensils, and deposited them in the
           treasuries of the house of the Lord.
       1       Then was Solomon thirteen years building a house for him-
        2  self.  He built it with timber from the forest of Libanus.          The
           length of it was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits,
           and the height thirty cubits.      It had three rows of cedar pillars,
           and the shoulders of the pillars were of cedar, and he vaulted
       3   the house above on the sides of the pillars.          The number of
       4   pillars were forty, and five the row.      And there were three gal-
       5   leries, story above story thrice.    And all the doors and windows,
           with the spaces between, were squares arched, windows and
       6   doors being over one another in three ranges.          And the ailam
           of the pillars which was fifty cubits in length, and fifty cubits
           in breadth, was joined to another ailam of the same dimen-
                                                                     â€”â€”â€”
     Ch. VIII.            III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
         sions in front of them, and the thickness of the pillars in front
       7 of it was for the ailarnins. And the ailam of thrones, where
       8 he was to administer justice, was the ailam of judgment.   And
         both were appurtenant to the house in which he was to dwell.
         They had one court communicating with both.       Of the same
         workmanship, and with such an ailam, he built a house for
      9 Pharao's daughter whom he had married.        All these were of
         costly stones engraved within from the base, and without to-
         wards the great court from the foundation to the copings, the
     10 foundation of the court being laid with large costly stones
     11 with stones of ten cubits, and those of eight cubits; and above
         with unhewn costly stones, of the same dimensions, and cedar
     12 beams ; for the great court round about was enclosed with
         three rows of unpolished stones, and one row of cedar.    Thus
         Solomon finished the whole house.
     VIII.     When Solomon had finished building the house of the
        Lord, and his own house, at the end of twenty years Solo-
         mon the king assembled all the elders of Israel at Sion, in or-
        der to carry up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the
      4 city of David, that is Sion, in the month Athanin.     And the
        priests carried the ark and the tabernacle of the testimony
        and the holy utensils, which were in the tabernacle of the tes-
      5 timony.   And the king and all Israel were before the ark,
      6 sacrificing sheep and beeves without number, while the priests
        were carrying the ark into its placeâ€”into the dabir of the
      7 houseâ€”into the Holy of Holiesâ€”under the wings of the che-
        rubim ; for the cherubim had their wings spread out over the
      S place of the ark, and from above covered the ark and the hal-
        lowed things thereof, and were above these hallowed things.
        Now the heads of these hallowed things were seen from the
        Holies in front of the dabir, but were not seen from without.
      9 There was nothing in the ark but the two tables of stone
        the tables of the covenant which Moses made at Choreb
        which the Lord established with the children of Israel on
     10 their coming out of the land of Egypt.     And it came to pass
     11 that when the priests came out of the holy place, the cloud
        filled the house, so that the priests could not stand to minister
     14 because of the cloud.   Because the glory of the Lord filled the
        house, therefore the king turned away his face.      And when
           VIII.          III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
       Ch.
          the king had blessed all Israel, and all the congregation of
          Israel stood up, then he said,
       15    Blessed be the Lord God of Israel this day, who with
          his mouth spake concerning my father David, and hath with
          his hands fulfilled, as he said, From the day I brought my peo-
       16 pie Israel out of Egypt, I made no choice of a city in any tribe
          of Israel to build a house for my name to be there.  Now I
          have made choice of Jerusalem for my name to be there, and
       17 have chosen David to be over my people Israel. But when it
          was in the heart of my father to build a house for the name
          of the Lord God of Israel, the Lord said to David my father,
      18 Because it came into thy heart to build a house for my name,
      19 thou didst well that it was in thy heart ; but as for thee, thou
          art not to build a house for me, but thy son only who hath
          sprung from thy loinsâ€”he shall build the house for my name.
      20 Now the Lord hath brought to pass that word of his which
         he spake, and I am risen up instead of my father David, and
         have sat on the throne of Israel, as the Lord spake, and have
      21 built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel, and
         established there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant
         of the Lord, which the Lord established with our fathers when
         he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
      22     Then Solomon went up over against the altar of the Lord,
         in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread
         forth his hands towards heaven and said,
      23       Lord the God of Israel, there is no god like thee in the
         heaven above and on the earth below, keeping covenant and
         mercy with thy servant who walketh before thee with his whole
      24 heart. These thou hast kept with thy servant David, my fa-
         ther :for what thou didst speak with thy mouth, thou hast
      25 with thy hands fulfilled as at this very day.Now therefore,
         Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David, my father,
         what thou hast spoken to him, saying, There shall not be
         taken from thee out of my presence a chief man sitting upon
         the throne of Israel, provided thy children take heed to their
      26 ways, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me. Now
         then,    Lord God of Israel, let I beseech thee, this word of
         thine to my father David be confirmed, that it may be so.
      27      Will God indeed dwell with men on the earth !        If
      Ch. VIII.            III. KINGS -I. KINGS.
         the heaven and the heaven of heaven will not suffice thee,
         far less indeed this house which I have built for thy name.
     28 Yet thou,      Lord, the God of Israel wilt look down on this
         supplication of mine to hearken to the prayer which thy ser-
         vant this day in thy presence prayeth to thee, that thine eyes
     29 may be open day and night on this houseâ€”on this place of
         which thou hast said, My name shall be there, that thou
         mayst hearken to the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward
         this place day and night.
     30     Thou indeed wilt hearken to the supplication of thy ser-
         vant and of thy people Israel.   Whatever they may address to-
        wards this place thou indeed wilt hearken to it in the place of
        thy habitation in heaven, and wilt do and be merciful.
     31     Whatever trespass any one may commit against his neigh-
        bour, when he shall take upon him a curse to curse him, and
     32 come and plead before this altar of thine in this house ; thou
        indeed wilt hearken from heaven and act and judge thy peo-
        ple Israel, by condemning the transgressor, and retributing
        his way upon his head, and by justifying the righteous and
        giving him according to his righteousness.
     33     When thy people Israel fall before enemies, because they
        have sinned against thee, and shall return and confess thy
     34 name, and pray and make supplication in this house ; thou
        indeed wilt hear from heaven and pardon the sins of thy people
        Israel, and bring them back to the land which thou gavest
        to their fathers.
    35      When the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because
        of their sinning against thee ; when they shall pray towards
        this place, and confess thy name and turn from their sins when
    36 thou hast humbled them ; thou indeed wilt hearken from
        heaven, and pardon the sins of thy servant and of thy people
        Israel ; for thou wilt shew them the good way, and give rain
        for the land which thou gavest to thy people for an' inheritance.
    37      If there be famine, if there be pestilence (for such things
        will be) if there be blasting, locust, mildew ; or if their enemy
        afflict them in any of their cities, in every occurrence, in every
    38 distress, whatever prayer, whatever supplication any man shall
        make, when they know every one the plague of his own heart,
    39 aud shall spread forth his hands toward this house ; thou in-
           vol. i.                    Id
                                                                                                                      ;
                                            III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
            Ch. VIII.
                  deed wilt hearken from heavenâ€”from thy settled habitation
                  and be merciful, and do and give to every man as thou know-
                  est his heart (for thou alone knowest the hearts of all the chil-
            40 dren of men) that they may fear thee all the days they live in
                  the land which thou gavest to their fathers.
            41         And with regard to the stranger who is not of thy people
            42 Israel, when they shall come and pray toward this place ; thou
            43 indeed wilt hearken from heavenâ€”from thy settled habitation,
                  and do according to all, for which the stranger may call upon
                  thee, that all nations may know thy name and fear thee as thy
                  people Israel do, and that they may know that this house which
                  I have built, is called by thy name.
             44         Because thy people are to go out to battle against their
                  enemies whithersoever thou shalt send them, when they shall
                  pray in the name of the Lord toward this city, which thou
                  hast chosen, and this house which I have built for thy name ;
             45 thou indeed wilt hearken from heaven to their prayer and do
                  them justice.
             46         Because they will sin against thee (for there is no man who
                  will not sin ;) when thou shalt punish them, and deliver them
                  up before their enemies ; and they who have captivated them
             47 shall carry them away captive to a land far off or near ; and
                  they bethink themselves in the land to which they have been
                  carried captives, and in the land of their captivity repent and
                  pray to thee, saying, We have sinned ; we have transgressed
             48 we have committed iniquity ; and turn to thee with their whole
                  heart, and with their whole soul, in the land of their enemies,
                   to which thou hast transported them ; and direct their prayers
                   to thee, toward this land which thou gavest to their fathers,
                   and this city which thou hast chosen, and this house which
             49 I have built for thy name; thou indeed wilt hearken from
             50 heaven, from thy settled habitation, and pardon the iniquities
                   which they have committed against thee, and all the acts of
                   disobedience of which they have been guilty ; and make them
                   objects of compassion in the sight of those who have captivat-
                   ed them, that they may have compassion on them.
             51         Because we are thy people whom thou hast brought out of
                   the land of Egyptâ€”from the midst of the iron furnace, let thy
                   eyes therefore be fixed on, and thy ears open to the prayer of
                   thy servant, and to the supplication of thy people Israel, to
                                                                      â€”                                       ;
      Ch. VIII.                      III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
           hearken to them in all for which they invoke thee, since thou
           hast set them apart for thyself for an heritage from among all
           the people of the earth, as thou spakest by the ministry of thy
           servant Moses, when thou,                        Lord, Lord, didst bring our fa-
           thers out of the land of Egypt.
                 Then Solomon spoke of the house as if he had just finished
           building it,
                 The Sun he pointed out in heaven
                The Lord said, he would dwell in darkness.
                Build thou my houseâ€”a house becoming thyself to dwell
                    in when new.
           Behold this is written in the book of the Ode.
      54         When Solomon had finished all this prayer and supplication
           to the Lord, he arose from before the altar of the Lord (for he
      55 had kneeled down on his knees and spread forth his hands to-
           wards heaven) and standing up he blessed all the congregation
      56 of Israel with a loud voice saying, Blessed be the Lord this day
           who hath given rest to his people Israel according to all that
           he hath spoken.             Not one word hath failed of all the good words
      57 which he spoke by the ministry of his servant Moses.                                            The
           Lord our God be with us as he was with our fathers ! May he
      58 never leave us nor forsake us !                     Mayhe incline our hearts to him
           to walk in all his ways, and to keep all his commandments and
      59 his statutes which he gave in charge to our fathers !                                   And may
           the words with which I have made supplication before the
            Lord our God, be nigh to the Lord our God day' and night,
           that the determination of every day in the year may establish
           the rights of thy servant and the rights of thy people Israel
      60 that all the nations of the earth may know that the Lord our
            God is very God, and that there is none else !                                And may our
            hearts be perfect with the Lord our God, that we may walk
            piously in his statutes, and keep his commandments, as at this
            day.
      62         Then the king and all the sons of Israel offered a sacrifice
       63 before the Lord.                 And king Solomon offered for the sacri-
            fices of thanksgiving which he offered to the Lord, twenty two
            thousand beeves, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep.
       64 And when the kino- and all the sons of Israel dedicated the
            house, the king on the same day consecrated the middle of the
       Ch. IX.           III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
          court in front of the house of the Lord, for he offered there the
          whole burnt offerings with the sacrifices and the suet of the
          thank offerings, because the brazen altar which was before the
          Lord was too small for the whole burnt offerings and the sacri-
       65 fices of the thank offerings to be offered thereon.And on that
          day Solomon and all Israel with himâ€”a great congregation
          from the bay of Emath to the river of Egypt, celebrated the
          festival before the Lord our God at the house which he had
          built ; eating and drinking and rejoicing before the Lord seven
       66 days. And on the eighth day he dismissed the people and they
          blessed the king and went away every man to his house rejoic-
          ing and with a glad heart, for all the goodness which the Lord
          had shewn to his servant David and to his people Israel.
       IX.    And when king Solomon had finished building the house
          of the Lord, and the king's house, and every design which it was
        2 his pleasure to execute, the Lord appeared to Solomon a se-
        3 cond time as he appeared at Gabaon and said to him, I have
          heard thy prayer and thy supplication which thou hast made
          before me, and have done for thee according to all thy prayer.
          I have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my
          name there for ever, and my eyes and my heart shall be there
        4 continually. And if thou wilt walk before me, as thy father
          David did, with integrity of heart and with uprightness, and do
          according to all that I commanded him, and keep my statutes
        5 and my commandments, I will establish the throne of thy king-
          dom in Israel for this age, as I promised thy father David, say-
        6 ing, There shall not fail thee a man ruling in Israel.But if you
          and your children turn aside from me, and do not keep my com-
          mandments and my statutes, which Moses hath laid before you,
        7 but go and serve strange gods and worship them ; I will assur-
          edly remove Israel from the land which I gave them, and cast
          out of my sight this house which I have hallowed for my name ;
          and Israel shall be a desolation and a bye word among all peo-
        8 pies ; and this stately house shall be reduced to such a condition
          that every one who passeth by it will be astonished and will,
          with expressions of pity, say, Why hath the Lord dealt thus
        9 with this land and with this house ?To which answer will be
          made, Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought
          their fathers out of Egyptâ€”out of the house of bondage ; and
    Ch. X.              III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
       in his stead chose strange gods, and worshipped and served
       them, therefore the Lord hath brought upon them this cala-
        mity.
    10     Then Solomon brought Pharao's daughter up out of the
        city of David to the house which he had built for himself. In
        those days, during the twenty years in which Solomon was
       building the two houses, the house of the Lord and the king's
    11 house, Chirarn king of Tyre supplied Solomon with cedar tim-
        ber and pine trees, and with gold and whatever he desired,
       therefore the king then gave Chiram twenty cities in the land
    12 of Galilee.  But when Chiram came from Tyre and went to Ga-
       lilee to see the cities which Solomon gave him, they did not please
    13 him ; therefore he said, What are these cities, my brother, which
       thou hast given me ?   And he called them Little mount, which
    14 is now their name.    Nevertheless Chiram brought Solomon a
    26 hundred and twenty talents of gold. Foron board the fleet which
       king Solomon built at Esion-gaber, and which was then at Ai-
    27 lath, on the border of the farther sea in the land of Edomâ€”in
       this fleet Chiram sent some of his servants who were seamen
       and skilled in the navigation of that sea, along with the servants
       of Solomon, and they went to Sophira and took thence a hun-
       dred and twenty talents of gold and brought it to king Solo-
       mon.
    X.     When the queen of Saba heard of the fame of Solomon and
     2 the name of the Lord, she came to try him with questions hard
       to be solved, and came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue,
       and with camels carrying spices, and gold in great abundance,
       and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon and had
       propounded to him all that was in her mind, Solomon answered
     3 all her questions. There was not a question overlooked by the
     4 king which he did not explain to her.    And when the queen
       of Saba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which
     5 he had built, and his provisions, and the order in which his
       servants sat at table, and in which the attendants stood ; and
       his dress, and his cup bearers, and his whole burnt offerings
       which he offered in the house of the Lord, she was struck with
     6 surprise, and said to the king, It was a true report which I heard
       in my own country concerning thy knowledge and thy under-
     7 standing ; but I did not believe them who told me till I came
                                                                                                                    ;
           Ch. X.                           III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
                 and my own eyes have seen.                       Now behold what they told me
                 was not one half.            Thou surpassest in good qualities all the re-
             8 port which I heard of thee in my own country.                                       Happy thy
                wives, and happy these servants of thine who stand continually
             9 in thy presence and hear all thy wisdom.                             Blessed be the Lord
                thy God who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Is-
                rael.      Because the Lord thy God loveth to establish Israel for
                ever, therefore he hath made thee king over them, to adminis-
                 ter justice according to their righteousness and their demerits.
           10 Then she gave Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold,
                and spices in great abundance, and precious stones.                                There came
                no more such an abundance of spices as the queen of Saba
                gave Solomon.
           11         The fleet of Chiram also which brought the gold from
                Suphar brought a great quantity of hewn timber and precious
           12 stones.         And of the hewn timber the king made the wainscot-
                tings of the house of the Lord and of the king's house, and
                nablas and kinyras for the musicians.                            There never had come
                such hewn timber into the country nor hath any such been
           13 any where seen to this day.                           And when king Solomon had
                given the queen of Saba all that she desired, even all that she
                asked, over and above all that he gave her out of his royal
                bounty, she set out on her return and went to her own coun-
                try, she and all her servants.
           14         Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one
           15 year was six hundred and sixty six talents of gold, besides
                 the tribute of them who were subdued, and what he got from
                 merchants, and from all the bordering kings and lords of the
           16 country.            And king Solomon made three hundred lances of
                 beaten gold, three hundred shekels of gold to each lance
           17 and three hundred suits of armour of beaten gold, three mnas
                 of gold to each suit of armour.                     These king Solomon deposited
           18 in the house of the forest of Libanus.                              The king made also a
            19 great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.                                       There
                 were six steps up to the throne, and behind the throne were
            20 busts of beeves, and on each side of the seat, arms ; and two
                 lions standing by the arms ; and there were twelve lions stand-
                 ing on the steps, six on one side and six on the other.                                    There
           21 was not the like in any kingdom.                            Moreover all the vessels for
    Ch. X.              III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
        king Solomon's service were made of gold.      The lavers were
        of gold, and all the utensils of the house of the forest of Liba-
        nns were gilt with gold.   None was of silver ; for it was not
    22 held in estimation in the days of Solomon.    For the king had
        at sea a Tharsian fleet with the fleets of Chiram.   One came
        every three years to the king from Tharsis, with gold and sil-
        ver and stones wrought in a lathe or hewn with a chisel.   This
        was an arrangement which king Solomon had made to provide
        for building the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and
        the wall of Jerusalem, and the citadel ; and to fortify the city
        of David and Assur and Magdol and Gazer and upper Bai-
        thoron and Jethermath and all the chariot cities and all the
        cities for the cavalry, and for all the works which he purposed
        to construct in Jerusalem and in all the country, in order to
        keep in subjection all the remains of the Chettites and the
        Amorites and the Pherezites and the Chananites and the
        Evites and the Jebusites and the Gergasites, who were not of
        the children of Israel.â€”The children of them who had been
        left with him in the land, whom the Israelites could not wholly
        extirpate, these Solomon subjected to a tribute which continu-
        eth to this day.  But from the children of Israel he exacted
        nothing; because they were his warriors and his servants, his
    23 chiefs and his nobles, his charioteers and his horsemen.     So
        Solomon was magnified above all the kings of the earth in
    24 riches and understanding.   And all the kings of the land sought
        an interview with Solomon, to hear his wisdom which the
    25 Lord put in his heart.    And they brought, every one as gifts,
        vessels of gold and raiment and stacte and spices and horses
    26 and mules and this every year.    And Solomon had four thou-
        sand mares for chariots and twelve thousand cavalry.       The
        mares he kept in the chariot cities and with the king at Jeru-
        salem.  And he was supreme over all the kings, from the river
        to the land of the Philistines and to the borders of Egypt.
    27 So the king made gold and silver to abound in Jerusalem like
    28 stones ; and cedars like the sycamore trees in the plain.  Now
        Solomon's horses came from Egypt and from Thekoua.         The
        king's merchants got them from Thekoua by barter, but
        from Egypt a chariot came up for a hundred shekels of silver
                                                                                                             ;;
            Ch. XL                        III. KINGS-I. KINGS.
                 and a horse for fifty, and at this rate they came by sea, for all
                 the kings of the Chettites, and for the kings of Syria.
            XL          Now king Solomon was immoderately fond of women.
                 He had seven hundred wives, princesses ; and three hundred
                 concubines;        and he took for wives strange women besides
                 Pharao's daughter, women of Moab and Ammon, Syrians,
             2 Idumeans, Chettites and Amorites.                         To those of the nations
                 concerning which the Lord had said to the Israelites, You shall
                 not go in unto them nor shall they come in unto you, lest they
                turn your hearts after their idolsâ€”to these Solomon was at-
             4 tached by love : so that when he grew old his heart was not
                 perfect with the Lord his God as the heart of his father David
             3 had been.           For when his strange wives had turned his heart
             7 after their gods, then Solomon built high places for Chamos
                the idol of Moab, and for their king the idol of the Ammon-
             8 ites, and for Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians : and
                 thus he did for all his strange wives who burned incense and
                 sacrificed to their idols.             So Solomon did evil in the sight of
             9 the Lord.          He did not follow the Lord like his father David
                therefore the Lord was angry with him, because he turned
            10 away his heart from the Lord God of Israel, who had appear-
                 ed to him twice and had given him a charge touching this
                 very thing, by no means to go after strange gods, but to be
                 careful to do what the Lord God commanded him.                                 His heart
            11 was not perfect with the Lord like the heart of his father Da-
                vid, therefore the Lord said to Solomon, Because these things
                have been done with thee, and thou hast not kept my com-
                mandments and my statutes which I enjoined thee, I will di-
                vide and rend thy kingdom out of thy hand and give it to thy
           12 servant.         But I will not do these things in thy days for the sake
                 of thy father David.            Out of the hand of thy son will I take it
            13 but I will not take the whole kingdom, I will give thy son one
                 tribe for David my servant's sake and for the sake of Jerusa-
            14 lem, the city which I have chosen.                       Then the Lord raised up
                adversaries to Solomon, namely, Ader the Idumean, and Es-
                rom son of Eliadae of Kaama.                      There had been an insurrec-
                tion against Adadezer king of Suba his lord, and he was at the
                head of the conspiracy and had seized on Damascus.                                   These
           15 were pests to Israel all the days of Solomon.                              Now Ader the
          XI.              III. KINGSâ€”1. KINGS.
     Oh.
         Idumean was of the seed royal of Iduniea, and in the general
         extirpation which David made of Edom, when Joab the cap-
         tain general of the army went to bury the dead after the gene-
     16 ral slaughter of the males in Idumea (for Joab and all Israel
         continued there six months till they cut off all the males in
     17 Idumea) Ader with all the principal Idumeans of the servants
     18 of his father fled and went to Egypt.        Ader was then but a
         child; but the men of the city Madiam arose and came to
         Pharan and taking the men with them went to Egypt.             And
         when Ader came to Pharao he gave him a house and ordered
     19 him a regular supply of provisions.     And Ader was in high fa-
         vour with Pharao so that Pharao gave him to wife his own
     20 wife's sister, an elder sister of Thekemina.     And the sister of
         Thekemina bore him a son named Ganebeth.            And Thekemi-
     21 na brought him up among the sons of Pharao.          Though Gane-
         beth was among the sons of Pharao, yet when Ader heard in
         Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the cap-
         tain general of the army was dead, Ader said to Pharao, Send
     22 me away that I may return to my own land.         Upon which Pha-
         rao said to him, What hast thou been in want of with me that
         thou seekest to go to thy own land ?        But Ader said, Never-
         theless thou must let me go.       So Ader returned to his own
         country.    And this was the mischief which Ader did, he was
         a bitter enemy to Israel and made himself king in the land of
         Edom.
     26      With regard to Jeroboam son of Nabat, the Ephrathite of
     27 Sarira, a widow's son, a servant of Solomon, this was the cause
         why he lifted up his hand against king Solomon.          When the
         king was building the citadel and enclosing with works the
      28 city of his father David, this man Jeroboam was mighty in
         power, and Solomon seeing that the youth was a man of bu-
      29 siness set him over the burdens of the house of Joseph.        And
         it happened that one time when Jeroboam went out to Jerusa-
         lem, Achia the Selonite the prophet met him on the road and
         took him aside out of the way.       Now Achia was clad with a
      30 new mantle; and when they were both alone in the fields,
         Achia took the new mantle which he had on and rent it into
         twelve pieces, and said to Jeroboam, Take for thyself ten
      31 pieces.  For thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, Behold I
             vol i.                     4 E
        Ch XII.             III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
           will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and give
        32 thee ten tribes.  But he shall have two tribes for David, my
           servant's sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which
       33 I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. Because he hath
           forsaken me and sacrificed to Astarte, the abomination of the
           Sidonians, and to Chamos and the idols of Moab, and to their
           king the horror of the Ammonites, and hath not walked in my
           ways to do what is right in my sight like his father David ;
       34 though by raising up enemies against him as I certainly shall
           do all the days of his life, I will not take out of his hand the
           kingdom, which shall continue to him entire, for the sake
       35 of my servant David whom I chose ; yet I will take it out of
       36 the hands of his son and give thee ten tribes.  And to his son
          I will give two tribes, that my servant David, may have a
          standing continually before me in Jerusalem, the city which I
       37 have chosen for myself to put my name there.       And I will
          take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth,
       38 and thou shalt be king over Israel.     And if thou wilt keep
          all that I will give thee in charge and walk in my ways, and
          do what is right before me, keeping my statutes, and my com-
          mandments, as my servant David did, I will be with thee,
          and I will build for thee a sure house, as I did for David. So
       40 when Solomon sought to put Jeroboam to death, he arose and
          fled to Egypt to Susakim king of Egypt, and continued in
          Egypt till the death of Solomon.
       41     Now the rest of the acts of Solomon and all that he did,
          and all his wisdom, behold, are they not written in the book of
       42 the acts of Solomon?     The time which Solomon reigned in
          Jerusalem, over all Israel, was forty years.And Solomon slept
          with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David.
          And when Jeroboam son of Nabat heard the news ; for having
          fled from the presence of Solomon he had settled in Egypt
          and was still there, he set out immediately and came to his
          own city Sarira which is iD mount Ephraim.
      43     Now when king Solomon slept with his fathers, Koboam
       XII.     his son reigned in his stead.And king Koboam went to
          Sikima because all Israel had come there, to make him king.
        3 And the people spoke to king Koboam, saying, Thy father
        4 made our yoke heavy, now therefore lighten thou the hard
                             KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
    Ch. XII.            III.
       service of thy father and his grievous yoke which he imposed
     5 on us and we will serve thee.    Whereupon he said to them,
     6 Go away for three days and come to me again.     So they went
       away.   And the king laid the matter before the elders who
       stood before Solomon his father while he was alive, and said,
     7 How do you advise me to answer this people ?        And they
       spoke to him saying, If thou wilt this day be a servant to
       the people and serve them and speak good words to them,
     8 they will then be thy servants, all thy days. But he slighted
       the counsel of the old men, which they gave him, and consult-
       ed with the young men who had been brought up with him,
       and who waited on him, and said to them, What do you ad-
     9 vise?   And what answer should I make to them who speak
       to me saying, Lighten the yoke which thy father laid on us ?
    10 And the young men who had been brought up with him, and
       waited on him spoke to him and said, Thus shalt thou say to
       this people, who have spoken to thee saying, Thy father made
       our yoke heavy, now therefore, lighten it for us, thus thou
       shalt say to them, My little finger shall be heavier than my
    11 father's loins.My father indeed loaded you with a heavy yoke ;
       but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips ;
    12 but I will chastise you with scorpions.  So when all the peo-
       ple came to the king on the third day as he had appointed, say-
       ing, Come to me again on the third day, the king answered the
    13 people roughly.  He slighted the counsel of the old men, which
    14 they had given him, and spoke to them, in the manner the
       young men advised, saying, My father made your yoke heavy
       but I will add to your yoke.    My father chastised you with
    15 whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.   So the king-
       hearkened not to the people.  Because the revolution was from
       the Lord, that he might perform the word which he spoke,
       by the ministry of Achia the Selonite, concerning Jeroboam,
    16 son of Nabat, therefore when all Israel saw that the king heark-
       ened not to them, they answered the king and said, What
       portion have we in David ?    We indeed have no inheritance
       in the son of Jessai.  To thy tents,     Israel ! Now David,
       feed thy own house.    So Israel departed to their habitations.
    18 And when the king sent out Adoniram, who was over the
       tribute, they stoned him with stones, so that he died.  Upon
       Ch. XII.               III. KINGSâ€”T. KINGS.
           which Koboam hasted to mount his chariot and flee to Jeru-
       19 salem.    So Israel renounced all allegiance to the house of Da-
           vid to this day.
       20      Now when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned
           from Egypt they had sent and invited him to the assembly, and
           they made him king over Israel, so that there was none who
           followed the house of David but only the tribes of Juda and
       21 Benjamin.     And when Koboam came to Jerusalem and assem-
           bled the congregation of Jucla and the tribe of Benjamin, a
           hundred and twenty thousand of the young men who were
           warriors, to fight against the house of Israel and to bring the
       22 kingdom again to Boboam son of Solomon, a word of the
       23 Lord came to Samaias a man of God, saying, Speak to Boboam
           son of Solomon king of Juda, and to all the house of Juda
       24 and Benjamin, and to the residue of the people, saying, Thus
           saith the Lord, You shall not go up, nor fight with your bre-
           thren the children of Israel.     Beturn every one to his house.
           For this thing is from me.     So they hearkened to the word of
           the Lord and desisted from going, as the Lord commanded
           them.
               When king Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried
           with his fathers in the city of David, Boboam his son reigned
           in his stead.  He was sixteen years old when he began to reign
           and he reigned twelve years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name
           was Naama a daughter of Ana son of Naas king of the Ammon-
           ites.  And he did evil in the sight of the Lord and did not
           walk in the way of his grand father David.        Now there was a
           man of Mount Ephraim, a servant of Solomon, whose name
           was Jeroboam and his mother's name was Sarira.           She was a
           harlot.   And Solomon had made him overseer of the burdens
           of the house of Joseph, and he had built Sarira on Mount
           Ephraim. And he had three hundred chariots of horses. He had
           built the citadel with the burdens of the house of Ephraim, and
           enclosed the city of David, and was aspiring to the kingdom.
           Upon which Solomon sought to put him to death, and he was
           terrified and fled to Sousakim king of Egypt, and was with him
           till Solomon died.    And when Jeroboam heard in Egypt that
           Solomon was dead, he addressed Sousakim king of Egypt and
           said, Send me away, that I may go to my own land.           Where-
        XIV.            III. KINGSâ€”T. KINGS.
   Ch.
       upon Sousakim said, Ask what thou wilt and I will give it
       thee.  For Sousakim had given Jeroboam for a wife Ano an
       elder sister of his own wife Thekamina.  She was great among
       the king's daughters and had born to Jeroboam his son Abia.
       And Jeroboam said to Sousakim, Only send me away and let
       me go.  So Jeroboam left Egypt and came to the land of Sarira
       which is on Mount Ephraim.      And thither all the tribe of
       Ephraim assembled and there       Jeroboam built a fortress.
   XIV.      And when his son fell sick of a grievous sickness Je-
       roboam went to inquire about his son, and he said to his wife
       Ano, Arise, go and inquire of God concerning the child whe-
       ther he will recover of his sickness. Now there was a man at
       Selom whose name was Achia.     He was sixty years of age and
       the word of the Lord was with him.   So when Jeroboam said to
       his wife, Arise and take in thy hand for the man of God some
       loaves and some cakes for his children, and grapes and a pot of
       honey, the woman arose and took in her hand loaves and two
       sweet cakes and grapes and a pot of honey for Achia.  Now the
       man was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see.
       So she departed from Sarira and proceeded on in herjourney.
       And when she came to the city, to Achia the Selonite, Achia
       said to his servant, Go and meet Ano the wife of Jeroboam and
       say to her, Come in and make no stop ; for thus saith the Lord,
       I am sending bitter things against thee.  And when Ano came
       in to the man of God, Achia said to her, Why hast thou
       brought me bread and grapes and sweet cakes and a pot of
       honey ?  Thus saith the Lord, Behold thou shalt depart from
       me and when thou shalt enter the city Sarira, thy maids will
       come out to meet and tell thee, The child is dead, For thus
       saith the Lord, Behold I will cut off from Jeroboam every
       male.  And them of Jeroboam who die in the city, the dogs
       shall devour ; and him who dieth in the field, the birds of the
       air shall devour.  But this child shall be bewailed with the
       lamentation, Alas !  Lord : because in him there hath been
       found something good respecting the Lord.       Upon hearing
       this the woman departed and just as she arrived at Sarira the
       child died, and the shout went forth to meet her.   Now when
       Jeroboam went to Sikima on Mount Ephraim and had assem-
       bled there the tribes of Israel, and Koboam son of Solomon
        Ch. XIV.            III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
           went up there, a word of the Lord came to Samaias the En-
           lamite, saying, Take thee a new mantle which hath never
           been dipt in water and rend it into twelve pieces and give
           them to Jeroboam and say to him, Thus saith the Lord,
           Take for thyself ten pieces that thou mayst put themâ€”(and
           when Jeroboam took them, Samaias said, Thus saith the
           Lord)â€”on the ten tribes of Israel.    Then the people said to
           Eoboam son of Solomon, Thy father made his yoke heavy on
           us, and loaded us with the meats for his table.  Now therefore
           make them lighter on us and we will serve thee.   And Koboam
           said to the people, Three days hence I will give you an an-
           swer.  Then Eoboam said, Bring to me the elders and I will
           consult with them what answer I shall give to the people on
           the third day.  And when Eoboam had stated to them the mes-
           sage which the people had sent to him, the elders of the people
           said, Do as the people have spoken to thee.       But Eoboam
           slighted their counsel. It was not pleasing in his sight.So he
           sent and convened them who were brought up with him and
           said to them, Such and such a message the people have sent
           to me.  Thereupon these courtiers of his, said, In this manner
           thou shalt speak to the people saying, My little finger shall be
           thicker than my father's thigh.  My father chastised you with
           whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. And this pleas-
           ed Eoboam, so he answered the people as these young cour-
           tiers of his advised him.  Upon which all the people like one
           man said, every one to his neighbourâ€”nay, they all shouted
           and said, We have no portion in David, nor inheritance in the
           son of Jessai.  To your tents,   Israel ! for this man is not fit
           to be chief or leader.So all the people dispersed from Sikima,
           and went away every man to his habitation.   But Eoboam per-
           sisted and went and mounted his chariot and returned to Jeru-
           salem, and all the tribe of Juda and all the tribe of Benjamin
           followed him.   And the same year when Eoboam had assem-
           bled all the men of Juda and Benjamin, and was going up to
           war against Jeroboam at Sikima, a word of the Lord came to
           Samaias the man of God, saying, Speak to Eoboam king of
           Juda, and to all the house of Juda and Benjamin, and to all the
           remnant of the people and say, Thus saith the Lord, You shall
           not go up, nor fight with your brethren the children of Israel.
   Ch. XIII.            III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
       Return every one to his house. For this thing is from me.  So
       they hearkened to the word of the Lord, and desisted from
       going up, as the Lord commanded them.
   25     Then Jeroboam rebuilt Sikima on mount Ephraim and
   26 dwelt there and he went out thence and built Phanuel.     And
      Jeroboam said in his heart, Behold now the kingdom will re-
   27 vert to the house of David, if the people go up to Jerusalem
      to offer sacrifice in the house of the Lord ; for the heart of the
      people will turn to the Lord and to their lord Eoboam king
   28 of Juda and they will kill me.   Therefore the king took coun-
      sel and went and made two calves of gold, and said to the
      people, Rest satisfied in respect to your going up to Jerusa-
      lem.   Behold these are thy gods,   Israel, which brought thee
   29 up out of the land of Egypt.    And he placed one of them in
   30 Baithel and the other he sent to Dan.    And this became an
      occasion of sinning. For the people went before the one even
   31 to Dan, and they forsook the house of the Lord,       xind he
      built houses on high places, and made priests of any part
   32 of the people who were not of the children of Levi.   And Je-
      roboam instituted a festival in the eighth month, on the fif-
      teenth clay of the month, answering to the festival in the land
      of Juda, and he went up to the altar which he made at Baithel
      to burn incense to the calves which he had made, and present-
      ed at Baithel the priests of the high places whom he had made.
   33 But when he ascended the altar, which he had made, on the
      fifteenth day of the eight month, at the festival which he had
      devised out of his own heart and made a festival for the chil-
      dren of Israelâ€”when he ascended the altar to offer incense,
   XIII.     behold a man of God from Juda came by a word of the
    2 Lord to Baithel while Jeroboam was standing on the altar to
      burn incense ; and by a word of the Lord cried to the altar
      and said,    Altar ! altar ! Thus saith the Lord, Behold a son
      shall be born to the house of David ; his name shall be Josias,
      and he will burn upon thee the priests of the high places, who
      burn incense on thee : and upon thee he will burn the bones
    3 of men.  And on this very day he will give a sign, for this, said
      he, is the word which the Lord hath spoken, saying, Behold
      the altar is rent, and the fat which is on it shall be poured out.
    I And when king Jeroboam heard the words of the iuan of God,
                                                                                                                      ;
                    XIII.                      III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
             Ch.
                   who cried against the altar, he stretched forth his hand from
                   the altar, saying, Seize him : and behold his hand, which he
                   stretched forth against him withered so that he could not draw
               5 it back to him.             And the altar was rent, and the fat was poured
                   out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of
               6 God gave by the word of the Lord.                                  Then king Jeroboam
                   said to the man of God, Entreat the favour of the Lord thy
                   God and let my hand be restored to me.                              So the man of God
                   entreated the favour of the Lord, and he restored the king's
               7 hand to him ; and it was as it had been before.                                Then the king
                  said to the man of God, Come home with me and dine, and
               8 I will give thee a reward.                      But the man of God said to the
                   king, If thou wouldst give me the half of thy kingdom, I can-
                   not go with thee to eat bread, nor drink water in this place
               9 for thus hath the Lord commanded me by his word, saying,
                   Thou must not eat bread nor drink water, nor return the way
             10 that thou goest.                 So he went away by another road, and did
                   not return by the way he came to Baithel.
             11         Now there dwelt at Baithel a certain old prophet, and his
                   sons came, and told him all that the man of God had done
                   that day at Baithel, and the words which he spoke to the king,
             12 and excited the attention of their father.                                 Whereupon their
                   father said to them, Which way went he ?                               And when his sons
                   had pointed out to him, the way which the man of God who
                   came from Juda was gone, he said to his sons, Saddle me the
             13 ass.        And when they had saddled the ass, he mounted it, and
                   went after the man of God and found him sitting under an
             14 oak, and said to him, Art thou the man of God who came
             15 from Juda?               And he said, I am.                 Then he said to him, Come
             16 with me and eat bread.                     And he replied I cannot go back with
             17 thee, nor can I eat bread, or drink water in this place; for so
                   the Lord hath expressly commanded me saying, Thou must
                   not eat bread nor drink water, nor turn back there the way
             18 thou hast gone.                 And he said to him, I also am a prophet as
                   thou art, and an angel hath spoken to me by the word of the
                   Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee to thy house and let
             19 him eat bread, and drink water.                            But he lied to him.                  And
                   when he had brought him back ; and he had eaten bread and
             20 drank water at his house, a word of the Lord came to the pro-
    Ch. XIV.               III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
    21 phet, who had brought him back, while they were sitting at
        the table ; and he said to the man of God who had come from
        Juda, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast disobeyed the
        command of the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment,
    22 which the Lord thy God commanded thee, but hast turned
        back and eaten bread and drunk water, in the place which he
        spoke to thee saying, Thou must not eat bread nor drink
        water, thy body shall not enter the sepulchre of thy fathers.
    23 So after he had eaten and drunk, he saddled for him an ass,
    24 and he turned and went away.         And a lion met him on the
        road and killed him, and his body was cast in the highway and
    25 the ass stood by it.     The lion also stood by the body.        And
        behold men who were passing by saw the corpse lying in the
        high way, and the lion standing near the corpse, and they
        came and spoke of it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
    26 And when he who had brought him back heard, he said, This
    28 is the man of God, who disobeyed the word of the Lord.             So
        he went and found the body cast in the highway, and the ass
        and the lion were standing by it.      The lion had not eaten the
    29 body of the man, nor hurt the ass.         So the prophet took up
        the body of the man of God, and having laid it on the ass he
    30 brought him back to the city to bury him in his own sepul-
        chre, and 4hey bewailed him with the lamentation, Alas bro-
    31 ther! And after bewailing him he spoke to his sons, saying,
        When I die, bury me in this grave, where the man of God
        is buried.   Place me close by his bones, that my bones may
    32 be preserved with his bones.      For what he hath spoken by the
        word of the Lord against the altar at Baithel, and against the
        high places of Samaria will surely come to pass.
    33      But after this affair Jeroboam did not turn from his wick-
        edness, but again made from any part of the people, priests of
        the high places.     Whoever pleased, consecrated himself and
    34 became a priest of the high places.       And this became a sin to
        the house of Jeroboam, and occasioned its destruction and
        utter removal from the face of the earth.
    XIV. 21 Now Koboam son of Solomon reigued over Juda.                 He
        was forty one years old at the commencement of this reign, and
        he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord
        had chosen out ofall the tribes of Israel to put his name there, and
            vol. i.                    4 f

       22 his mother's name was Naama, the Ammonitess.        Roboam did
           what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and provoked him with
           all those things which their fathers had done, with all the sins
       23 which they had committed.       They built for themselves high
           places, and pillars, and arbours, on every high hill and under
       24 every shady tree, and sodomy was committed in the land.     And
           they practised all the abominable acts of the nations which
           the Lord had removed from before the children of Israel.
        25 Wherefore in the fifth year of Eoboam's reign, Sousakim
           king of Egypt came out against Jerusalem, and took all the
        26 treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the
           king's house, and the golden lances which David had taken
           out of the hand of the servants of Adraazar king of Suba, and
           brought to Jerusalem.    All these he took,, together with the
           golden armour which Solomon had made, and carried them
        27 away to Egypt.     And in their stead king Koboam made bra-
           sen armour which were committed to the charge of the officers
        28 of the guards who kept the door of the king's house.    And be-
           cause, when the king went to the house of the Lord, the guard
           carried them, therefore they were fixed up against the wall of
        29 the guard room.   Now the rest of the acts of Roboam and all
           that he did, behold, are they not written in the journal of the
           kings of Juda ?   Now there was a war between Roboam and
           Jeroboam all their days.   And when Roboam went to rest with
           his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
        XV.     David, Abiou his son reigned in his stead.         In the
         2 eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nabat, Abiou,
         3 son of Roboam began to reign over Juda, and reigned three
           years in Jerusalem.   His mother's name was Maacha, a grand
           daughter of Abessalom.     And he walked in the sins of his
           father which he had committed in his sight, and his heart, like
           the heart of his father, was not perfect before the Lord his
         4 God.   Nevertheless for the sake of David, the Lord gave him
           surviving issue that he might establish his children after him,
         5 and establish Jerusalem, as David had done what was right in
           the sight of the Lord, and had not deviated all the days of his
         7 life from all that he commanded him.    Now the rest of the acts
           of Abiou and all that he did, behold are they not written in the
           journal of the kings of Juda ? for the war continued between
      Ch. XV.             III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
       8 Abiou and Jeroboam.    And Abiou went to rest with bis fathers
         in the twentieth year of the reign of Jeroboam, and was buried
         with his fathers in the city of David, and Asa his son reigned
         in his stead.
       9    In the twenty fourth year of the reign of Jeroboam king of
         Israel, Asa began to reign over Juda, and he reigned forty one
     10 years in Jerusalem.   His mother's name was Ana, a descendant
     11 of Abessalom.    And Asa did what was right in the sight of the
     12 Lord, like his father David.    He removed the prostitutes out
         of the land, and abolished all the devices which his father had
     13 instituted, and degraded his mother Ana from the rank of
         queen, as she had kept an assembly in her arbour.      And Asa
         cut down her bowers and burned them with fire by the brook
     14 Kedron.    But he did not remove the high places.   Nevertheless
     15 Asa's heart was perfect before the Lord all his days.    And he
         brought in the pillars of his father.  He brought in also his
         own pillars which were of gold or silver, together with vessels
     16 into the house of the Lord.     Now there was a war between
     17 Asa and Baasa, the king of Israel, all their days.    And when
         Baasa, king of Israel came up, and was building Rama, that
     18 none might go out or come in to Asa king of Juda, Asa took
         all the silver and gold which was found in the treasures of
         the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house,
        and delivered it into the hands of his servants ; and Asa des-
         patched them to Son Ader, son of Taberema the son of Azin
     19 king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying, Renew with
         me the league which was between my father and thy father.
         Behold I have sent thee presents of gold and silver, come
         break thy league with Baasa king of Israel, that he may go up
     20 from me.    Accordingly Sod Ader hearkened to king Asa, and
         sent the generals of his armies against the cities of Israel, and
         they smote Ain and Dan and Abel, of the house of Macha,
     21 and all Chennereth, even to the land of Nephthaleim.        And
         when Baasa heard this, he left off building Rama and went
     22 back to Thersa.   Whereupon king Asa sounded to all Juda the
         alarm Against the Enakims.   And they carried away the stones,
         and the timber, with which Baasa was building Rama,        And
         with them king Asa built mount Benjamin and the watch
     23 tower.   Now the rest of the acts of Asa, and all the power he
                                                                       â€”
       Ch. XVI.            III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
           exercised, and the cities which he built, behold are they not
          written in the book of the journal of the kings of Juda ?In his
       24 old age he was afflicted with the gout.  And when Asa went to
          rest with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city
          of David, Josaphat his son reigned in his stead.
       25     Now Nabat son of Jeroboam began his reign in the second
       26 year of Asa king of Juda, and reigned two years in Israel. And
          he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of
          his father, and in his sins with which he caused Israel to sin.
       27 And Baasa son of Achia beset him at the house of Belaan son
          of Achia and slew him at Gabathon of the Philistines : for Na-
       28 bat and all Israel were besieging Gabathon.  Baasa slew him in
          the third year of Asa son of Abiou king of Juda and reigned in
       29 his stead.  And soon as he began to reign he smote the whole
          house of Jeroboam.   He did not leave a living soul belonging to
          Jeroboam until he had utterly extirpated him according to the
       30 word of the Lord which he spoke by the ministry of his ser-
          vant Achia the Selonite, for the sins of Jeroboam who had
          caused Israel to sin, and for the provocation with which he had
       31 provoked the Lord God of Israel.   Now the rest of the acts of
          Nabat and all that he did, behold are they not written in the
          book of the journal of the kings of Israel ?
       33    In the third year of Asa king of Juda, Baasa son of Achia
          began his reign of twenty four years over Israel, at Thersa.
       34 Andhe did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way
          of Jeroboam son of Nabat, and in his sins, with which he caused
       XVI.     Israel to sin ; therefore a word of the Lord came to Baasa
        2 by the ministry of Iou son of Anani, Because, though I raised
          thee from the ground and made thee ruler over my people Is-
          rael, thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and caused my
          people Israel to sinâ€”to provoke me to wrath by their idols,
        3 behold I will rouse after Baasa and after his house, and I will
          make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat
        4 Him of Baasa who dieth in the city the dogs shall devour ; and
          him who dieth in the fields the birds of the air shall devour.
        5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasa and all that he did, and his
          exploits, behold are they not written in the book of the journal
        6 of the kings of Israel ?And Baasa slept with his fathers and was
          buried at Thersa, and Ela his son reigned in his stead.
    Ch. XVI.           III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
     7    Now by the ministry of Iou son of Anani, the Lord had
       spoken against Baasa, and against his house, on account of all
        the wickedness which he had committed in the sight of the
       Lord to provoke him to wrath by the works of his hands, that
       he should be treated like the house of Jeroboam, and that he
     8 would smite him.  So when Ela son of Baasa had reigned over
       Israel two years at Thersa, Zambri the commander of one half
     9 of his cavalry, conspired against him ; and when he was drink-
    10 ing to excess in the house of Osa his steward at Thersa, Zam-
       bri went in and smote him, and killed him, and reigned in his
    11 stead. And when he had made himself king, and seated him-
    12 self on his throne, he smote all the house of Baasa accordiug to
       the word which the Lord spoke to Iou the prophet, against the
    13 house of Baasa, for all the sins of Baasa and his son Ela, be-
       cause they had caused Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God
    14 of Israel by their idols.Now the rest of the acts of Ela and all
       that he did, behold are they not written in the journal of the
       kings of Israel ?
    15    And Zambri reigned at Thersa seven days, and Israel was
    16 encamped against Gabathon of the Philistines.But when the
       people in the camp heard the news that Zambri had conspired
       and slain the king, they made Arnbri the general of the army
    17 of Israel, king over Israel that very day in the camp.And Arn-
       bri with all Israel marched up from Gabathon and laid siege
    18 to Thersa. And when Zambri saw that the city was taken, he
       went into a cellar of the king's house and set the house on fire
    19 over him.  So he died for the sins which he had committed by
       doing evil in the sight of the Lord, and walking in the way of
       Jeroboam son of Nabat, and in his sins so as to cause Israel to
    20 sin. Now the rest of the acts of Zambri and the conspiracies
       which he contrived ; behold are they not written in the journal
       of the kings of Israel ?
    21    Then were the people of Israel divided.  One half of the
       people followed Thamni son of Gonath to make him king ; and
    22 the other half of the people followed Ambri.But the people
       who followed Ambri prevailed over them who followed Tham-
       ni son of Gonath.So Thamni and his brother Joram died at the
    23 same time.  And Ambri reigned after Thamni in the thirty first
       year of king Asa. And Ambri reigned twelve years over Israel.
                    Ch. XVI.                                                III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
                    24 He reigned at Thersa six years.                                                                    Then Ambri purchased mount
                              Semeron of Semer the lord of the mount, for two talents of
                              silver, and having built on the mount, he called the name of
                             the city which he had built, Semeron, after the name of Semer
                    25 the owner of the mount.                                                       And Ambri did evil in the sight of
                             the Lord.                       Nay, he exceeded in wickedness all that went before
                    26 him, and walked in all the way of Jeroboam son of Nabat,
                             and in the sins by which he caused Israel to sin, to provoke
                    27 the Lord God of Israel with their idols.                                                                                    Now the rest of the
                             acts of Ambri and all that he did, and all his power, behold
                    28 are they not written in the journal of the kings of Israel ?                                                                                                            And
                             Ambri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and
                              Achab his son reigned in his stead.
                                       Now in the eleventh year of Ambri, Josaphat son of Asa
                              began to reign when he was thirty years of age, and reigned
                             five years in his father's reign, and twenty five years in Jerusa-
                         â€¢   lem ; and his mother's name was Gazuba a daughter of Seli.
                             He walked in the way of his father Asa and deviated not from
                              it, doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord.                                                                                         But the high
                              places were not removed.                                                    On these they sacrificed and burn-
                              ed incense.                          Now the agreements which Josaphat made with
                              the king of Israel, and all the dominion which he exercised
                              and the battles which he fought, behold are they not written
                              in the journal of the kings of Juda ?                                                                      The remains of prostitu-
                              tion which were set up in the days of his father Asa he remov-
                              ed out of the land.                                         Though he was not king in Syria-Nasib,
                              king Josaphat built a fleet for Tharsis to go to Sophir for gold.
                              But it did not go ; for the fleet was wrecked at Gesion gaber.
                              Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat, let me send thy ser-
                              vants in the fleet with my servants : but Josaphat would not
                              consent.                   And when Josaphat went to sleep with his fathers he
                              was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Joram
                              his son reigned in his stead.
                     29                 In the second year of Josaphat king of Juda, Achab son of
                     30 Ambri began his reign of twenty two years over Israel.                                                                                                                 And
                              Achab did evil in the sight of the Lord, and surpassed in
                     31 wickedness all that went before him.                                                                               It did not suffice him to
                               walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nabat; but he took to
                               wife Jezabel, a daughter of Jethebaal king of the Sidonians,
                                                                                                                        ;
      Ch XVII.                            III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
      32 and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.                                                     And he
            erected for Baal an altar in the house of his idols, which he
      33 had built in Samaria.                       Achab also made a bower, and proceed-
            ed on in adding to his provocations, to provoke the Lord God
            of Israel and to destroy his own soul.                            He did evil above all the
            kings of Israel who were before him.
      34          Now in his days Achiel the Baithelite, rebuilt Jericho.
            With Abeiron, his first born, he laid the foundation thereof,
            and with Segub his youngest son, he set up its gates, according
            to the word of the Lord which he spoke by Joshua son of
            Nave.
      XVII.              And the prophet Elias the Thesbite, who was of Thes-
            bon in Galaad, said to Achab, As the Lord God of hosts, the
            God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be
        2 dew nor rain for years but by the word of my mouth.                                                   Then
        3 a word of the Lord came to Elias, Go hence eastward and
            hide thyself by the brook Chorrath which is before the Jordan
        4 and thou shalt have water from the brook to drink and I will
        5 command the ravens to feed thee there.                                   So Elias did according
            to the word of the Lord, and took up his abode by the brook
        6 Chorrath, fronting the Jordan.                              And the ravens brought him
            bread in the morning and flesh in the evening, and he drank
        7 water from the brook.                        And when he had been there a year,
        8 the brook dried up ; for there was no rain in the land.                                             There-
            upon a word of the Lord came to Elias, Arise and go to Sarepta
         9 of Sidonia.             Behold I have ordered a widow woman there to
       10 sustain thee.               So he arose and went to Sarepta, and when he
            came to the gate of the city, behold there was there a widow
             woman gathering sticks.                       And Elias cried after her, and said
            to her, Eetch me, I pray thee, a little water that I may drink.
       11 And as she was going to fetch it, Elias called after her and
             said, Bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand.
       12 Whereupon the woman said, xls the Lord thy God liveth, I
             have not a cake baked and only about a handful of barley meal in
            the jar and a little oil in the vessel ; and behold I was picking
             up a few sticks, that I may go in and prepare it for myself and
       13 my children, that we may eat and die.                                   And Elias said to her,
             Take courage, go in and do as thou hast said, but make for
             me a little cake of it, and bring it out first to me, and after-
       Ch. XVIII.         III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
       14 wards thou shalt make for thyself and thy children.  For thus
          saith the Lord, The jar of meal shall not fail, nor shall the
          vessel of oil diminish, until the Lord shall send rain on the
       15 land.  So the woman went and did so.    And though she and
       16 her children ate yet the jar of meal did not fail, nor was tbe oil
          in the vessel diminished, according to the word of the Lord
       17 which he spoke by Elias. And it happened that the son of the
          woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick ; and the disorder
       18 increased till there was no breath left in him.Upon which she
          said to Elias, What hast thou to do with me,    man of God ?
          Art thou come to me to bring my sins into remembrance and
       19 cause my son to die?  And Elias said to the woman, Give me
          thy son. So he took him out of her bosom and carried him up
          into the upper chamber where he lodged, and laid him on his
      20 bed.   Then Elias cried and said, Wo is me !   Lord !  Here is
          the witness of the widow with whom I dwell.       Thou hast
      21 afflicted her in causing her son to die.   And when he had
          breathed on the child three times and called on the Lord, he
          said,   Lord, my God, 1 beseech thee let this child's life be
      22 restored to him.   And so it came to pass and the child cried.
      23 Then Elias brought it down from the upper chamber, and de-
      24 livering him to his mother, said, See, thy son liveth.Where-
          upon the woman said, Now I know that thou art a man of God,
          and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is true.
      XVIII.     And after many days, a word of the Lord came to Elias
          in the third year, saying, Go and shew thyself to Achab and I
       2 will send rain on the face of the land.Now when Elias went to
          shew himself to Achab there was a grievous famine in Samaria.
       3 And Achab had called his steward Abdiou.         This Abdiou
       4 feared the Lord greatly ; so that when Jezabel smote the pro-
          phets of the Lord, Abdiou took a hundred men who were pro-
          phets, and hid them by fifties in a cave, and fed them with bread
       5 and water.   And Achab said to Abdiou, Come and let us go
          through the land to the fountains of water and to the brooks,
          perhaps we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive,
          that they may not be utterly destroyed from our habitations.
       6 So they divided the way between them, that they might
          traverse the country.   Achab went one way, and Abdiou
       7 went by himself another way.      And as Abdiou was in the
    Ch. XVIIT.          III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
       way by himself Elias came by himself to meet him.      Where-
       upon Abdiou hasted and fell on his face and said, Art
     8 thou he, my lord Elias ?   And Elias said, I am, Go and tell
     9 thy master, Behold Elias is here.   And Abdiou said, In what
       have I sinned that thou shouldst deliver thy servant into the
    10 hand of Achab, that he may put me to death ?   As the Lord thy
       God liveth, there is not a nation or a kingdom to which my
       master hath not sent to seek thee. And if they said, He is not
       here, he burned the kingdom or its borders, because he did
    11 not find thee.  And now thou sayst, Go tell thy master, Be-
       hold Elias is here.  But it may be, that when I am gone from
       thee, the Spirit of the Lord will carry thee away to a land
       which I know not.   So that when I shall go and tell Achab, and
    13 he shall not find thee, he will kill me.Now thy servant is one
       who feareth the Lord from his youth.    Hath it not been told
       thee, my lord, what I did when Jezabel slew the prophets of
       the Lordâ€”how I hid a hundred men of the prophets of the
       Lord by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water ?
   14 Yet, now thou sayst, Go, tell thy master, Behold Elias is here,
   15 that he may kill me.    And Elias said, As the Lord of hosts
       liveth, before whom I stand, I will this day shew myself to him.'
   16 Then Abdiou went to meet Achab, and when he told him,
   17 Achab hasted and came to meet Elias.      And when Achab saw
   18 Elias, he said to him, Art thou he, the troubler of Israel ? To
       which Elias replied, I am not the troubler of Israel ; but thou
       and thy father's house are, by your forsaking the Lord your
   19 God and going after the Baalims.       Now therefore send and
       gather to me all Israel to mount Carniel, and the prophets of
       shame, four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the bowers
   20 four hundred, who eat at Jezabel's table.    And when Achab
       had sent to all Israel, and had assembled all the prophets at
       mount Carniel, Elias came near before them all, and Elias said
   21 to them, How long will you halt between two opinions ?   If the
       Lord is God, follow him : but if Baal ; follow him.   But the
   22 people made no reply.   Then Elias said to the people, I am left
      a prophet of the Lord myself alone.   But the prophets of Baal
      are four hundred and fifty men, and the prophets of the Bower
   23 four hundred.   Let there be given to us two young bulls, and
      let them chuse one for themselves, and cut him in pieces, and
          vol. i.                    4 G
                                                                                                                              !

                  lay thern on wood, but put no fire ; and I will prepare the
            24 other and put no fire.                     And call ye on the name! of your gods,
                 and I will invoke the name of the Lord my God.                                          And the God
                  who shall answer by fire, let him be God.                                  And all the people
            25 answered and said, The proposal thou hast made is fair.                                                Then
                  Elias said to the prophets of shame, Chuse for yourselves one
                  young bull and prepare it first ; for you are many ; and call
            26 on the name of your god, but put no fire to it.                                     So they took the
                  young bull, and prepared it, and called on the name of Baal
                  from morning till noon, and said, Hearken to us,                                                   Baal
                  Hearken to us.                But there was no voice.                        There was no an-
                  swer ; though they ran upon the altar which they had erected.
            27 And when it was noon, Elias the Thesbite mocked them, and
                  said, Call louder ; for he is a god ; for he is engaged in medita-
                 tation, or perhaps he is busy, or perhaps he is asleep, and must
            28 be awaked.               Then they called with a loud voice, and according
                  to their custom cut themselves with knives and lancets till there
                  was a gush of blood upon them, and prophesied till the approach
            29 of the evening.                 But when it was about the time when the sacri-
                  fice should ascend, Elias the Thesbite spoke to the prophets of
                  the idols, and said, Desist now, and I will prepare my whole
            30 burnt offering.                 So they desisted, and went away.                             Then Elias
            31 said to the people, Draw near to me.                                 And when all the people
                  came near before him, Elias took twelve stones according to
                  the number of the tribes of Israel, to whom the Lord had
            32 spoken, saying, Thy name shall be Israel; and he built the
                  stones in the name of the Lord, and repaired the altar which
                  had been thrown down.                        Then he made a trench around the
            33 altar sufficient to contain two measures of seed, and piled up
                  the split wood upon the altar which he had made.                                               He then
                  divided the whole burnt offering in quarters, and laid it on the
                  split wood.           And when he had laid it in order upon the altar,
                  he said, Bring me four pots of water and pour it on the whole
            34 burnt offering and on the split wood.                                And when they had done
                  so, he said, Do the same again.                           And when they had done this
                   a second time, he said, Do it a third time.                                    So they did it a
             35 third time, and the water ran down about the altar and filled
             36 the trench with water.                       Then Elias raised his voice to heaven
                  and said,              Lord, the God of Abraham and of Isaak and of
      Ch. XIX.              III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
          Israel, hearken to me !     Lord, hearken to me this day by fire,
          And let all this people know, that thou art the Lord God of Is-
          rael, and that I am thy servant, and that by thee I have done
      37 these works.    Hearken to me,       Lord !   Hearken to me ; and
          let this people know, that thou art the Lord God, and that thou
      38 hast turned the heart of this people back again.          Thereupon
          fire from the Lord fell down out of heaven and consumed the
          whole burnt offering, with the split wood and the water in the
      39 trench and the stones, and licked up even the dust.         Then all
          the people fell on their faces and said, Of a truth the Lord is
      40 God.    He is very God.     Then Elias said to the people, Seize
          the prophets of Baal.   Let none of them escape.     So they seized
          them and brought them to Elias, down to the brook Kison and
      41 slew them there.     Then Elias said to Achab, Go up and eat
      42 and drink, for there is a sound of coming rain.     So when Achab
          went up to eat and drink, Elias went up to the top of Carrnel,
          and having bowed down on the earth, he put his face between
      43 his knees and said to his servant, Go up and look towards the
         sea.  And when the servant looked and said, There is nothing,
      44 Elias said, Keturn thou again seven times.       So the servant re-
         turned seven times, and at the seventh time he said, Behold
         there is a little cloud like a man's foot drawing up water.
         Whereupon he said, Go up and say to Achab, Prepare thy
      45 chariot and go down lest the rain overtake thee.       In the mean
         while the heaven gradually darkened with clouds and wind,
          and there came on a great rain,      xlnd while Achab wept and
          was travelling on to Jezrael the hand of the Lord was upon
         Elias and having girded up his loins, he ran before Achab
      XIX.      to Jezrael.   And when Achab told his wife Jezabel
         all that Elias had done, and how he had slain the prophets
         with the sword, Jezabel sent to Elias, and said, As sure as
       2 thou art Elias, and I Jezabel, God do so to me and more
         also, if by this time to-morrow I do not make thy life like the
       3 life of one of them.    At this Elias was terrified, and arose and
         went where his inclination led him, and coming to Bersabee,
       4 in the land of Juda, he left his servant there, and he himself
         went a day's journey into the wilderness ; and came and sat
         down under a juniper tree, and intreated that he might die,
         and said, Let the present suffice.       Take, I beseech thee, O
        Ch. XIX.                      III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
             Lord, my life from me ; for I am not better than my fathers-
          5 Then he lay clown and fell fast asleep there under a bush.                     And
          ti behold one touched him and said to him, Kise and eat. And Eli-
             as looked up and behold at his head a cake of barley bread, and
             a pitcher of water ! So he arose and ate and drank, and again laid
          7 himself down to sleep.          And the angel of the Lord returned the
             second time and touched him and said to him, Kise and eat, for
          8 the journey may be too great for thee.                So he arose and ate and
             drank, and in the strength of that meal travelled forty days and
          9 forty nights till he came to mount Choreb, and having there
             gone into the cave and taken up his lodging there, behold a
             word of the Lord came to him and said, Why art thou come
        10 hither Elias ?        To which he replied, I have been very zealous
             for the Lord Almighty, because the children of Israel hath for-
             saken thee.       They have demolished thy altars and slain thy
         11 prophets with the sword.             And I alone am left and they seek
             my life to take it.         And it said, Thou shalt go out to-morrow
             and stand before the Lord on the mount.                      Behold the Lord
             will pass by.      Accordingly behold there was a mighty strong
             blast of wind rending mountains and breaking rocks in pieces
             before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind.                            And
             after the wind, there was an earthquake ; but the Lord was
             not in the earthquake.          And after the earthquake, a fire ; but
             the Lord was not in the fire.             And after the fire, there was a
             sound of a gentle breeze which when Elias heard, he covered
        13 his face with his mantle and went out and stood beneath
             the cave.      And behold there came a voice to him and said,
        14 Why art thou come hither, Elias ?                    To which Elias replied,
             I have been very zealous for the Lord Almighty, because the
             children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant.                   They have de-
             molished thy altars and slain thy prophets with the sword ; and
        15 I alone am left, and they seek my life to take it.                         And the
             Lord said to him, Go, return on thy way ; and when thou art
             come to the way of the wilderness of Damascus, thou shalt
        16 go and anoint Azael to be king of Syria ; and thou shalt anoint
             Jehu son of Namessi to be king over Israel ; and Elisha son
        17 of Saphat thou shalt anoint to be a prophet in thy stead.                       And
             it shall come to pass that him who escapeth from the sword of
             Azael, Jehu will slay ; and him who escapeth from the sword
      Ch. XXI.                III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
      18 of Jehu, Elisha will slay.     But thou shalt leave in Israel seven
         thousand men, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal,
     19 and every mouth which hath not worshipped him.                   So when
         he departed thence he found Elisha son of Saphat.                He was
     20 ploughing with cattle.         There were twelve yoke before him,
         and he was with the twelve.       Andas he passed by him, he threw
         his mantle on him.       Whereupon Elisha left the cattle and ran
     21 after Elias and said, Let me salute my father and I will follow
         thee.   And Elias said, Return ; for I have done with thee.            So
         he returned from following him, and he took the cattle which
         were yoked, and slew them, and boiled them with the im-
         plements of the cattle, and gave them to the people, and when
         they had eaten, he arose and went after Elias and waited on
         him.
     XXI.        Now Nabuthi the Jezraelite had a vineyard near the
       2 threshing floor of Achab king of Samaria.            And Achab spoke
         to Nabuthi, saying, Give me this vineyard of thine, that I
         may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near my house ;
         and I will give thee another vineyard better than it; or if it
         seem good in thy sight, I will give thee money in exchange
         for thy vineyard, that I may have it for a kitchen garden.
      3 And Nabuthi said to Achab, God forbid that I should give
      4 thee the inheritance of my fathers : at which Achab's spirit was
         so disturbed, that he laid himself down on his bed and cover-
      5 ed his face and would not eat.            Thereupon Jezabel his wife,
         went to him and said to him, Why is thy spirit troubled so that
         thou art not at thy meal ?      And he said to her, Because I spoke
         to Nabuthi the Jesraelite, saying, Give me thy vineyard for
         money, or if thou please I will give thee another vineyard for
         it ; but he said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fa-
      7 thers.    And Jezabel his wife said to him, Is it thus thou now
         actest the king over Israel ?       Arise and eat, and be like thy-
         self, and I will give thee the vineyard of Nabuthi the Jezra-
      8 elite.    Then she wrote a letter in Achab's name, and sealed
         it with his seal, and sent it to the elders and freemen, who
      9 dwelt with Nabuthi.        This was the purport of the letter.       Pro-

                     12 them, even as it was written in the letter she sent them.                                                                                                                              So

                              him and testified against him saying, Thou hast renounced
                              God and the king.                                          Upon which they led him out of the city,
                     14 and stoned him with stones so that he died.                                                                                             Then they sent to
                     15 Jezabel saying, Nabuthi hath been stoned and is dead.                                                                                                                        When
                              Jezabel heard she said to Achab, Arise and take possession
                               of the vineyard of Nabuthi the Jezraelite, who would not give
                     1         it to thee for money, for he is not alive, for he is dead.                                                                                                                   But
                               when Achab heard that Nabuthi the Jezraelite was dead, he
                               rent his clothes and put on sackcloth                                                                              yet after doing this, he

                               arose and went down to the vineyard of Nabuthi the Jezraelite,
                     17 to take possession of it.                                                            Whereupon the Lord spoke to Elias
                     18 the Thesbite, saying, Arise and go down to meet Achab king of
                               Israel, who is at Samaria ; for he is in the vineyard of Nabuthi
                     19 for he is gone down there to take possession of it.                                                                                                                 And thou
                               shalt speak to him, and say, Thus saith the Lord, As thou
                               hast murdered and taken possession, therefore thus saith the
                               Lord, In every place where the swine and dogs have licked the
                               blood of Nabuthi, there shall the dogs lick thy blood, and har-
                     20 lots shall bathe themselves in thy blood.                                                                                                And Achab said to
                               Elias, Hast thou found me,                                                                   my enemy ?                                To which he re-
                               plied, I have found thee.                                                   Because thou hast sold thyself to do
                               evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to wrath, behold I
                     21 am goingto bring evil upon thee, and I will kindle a flame after
                               thee and utterly destroy the whole race of Achab, both him
                     22 who is attended and him who is neglected in Israel.                                                                                                              And I will
                              make thy house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nabat, and
                               like the house of Bassa son of Achia, for the provocations with
                     23 which thou hast provoked me, and caused Israel to sin.                                                                                                                     And to
                               Jezabel the Lord hath spoken saying, The dogs shall devour
                     24 her on the ramparts of Jezrael.                                                                      Him of Achab who dieth in the
                               city, the dogs shall devour, and him who dieth in the fields, the
                               birds of the air shall devour.
                      25                  But though Achab had acted foolishly in selling himself to
                                do evil in the sight of the Lord, as Jezabel his wife incited him,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,

     26 and though he had rendered himself very abominable, by fol-
        lowing abominations with all the ceremonies practised by the
        Amorites, whom the Lord had rooted out from before Israel;
     27 yet as Achab was struck with compunction at this message on
        account of the Lord, and went away weeping; and as he had
        rent his clothes and girded sackcloth on his body and fasted ;
        for he had put on sackcloth on the day he smote Nabuthi the
     28 Jezraelite ; therefore when he went away, a word of the Lord
        came by the hand of his servant Elias concerning Achab, and
     29 the Lord said, Hast thou seen how Achab is struck with com-
        punction on account of me ?       I will not bring on the calamity in
         his days ; but in the days of his sons I will bring it on.
     XX.       Now when Son Acler had assembled all his army, he went
         up and sat down before Samaria.         He had with him thirty two
      2 kings and all his cavalry and chariots.           And when they had
         gone up and laid siege to Samaria and fought against it, he
         sent to Achab king of Israel into the city, and said to him,
      3 Thus saith Son Ader ; Thy silver and thy gold are mine.             And
      4 thy wives and thy children are mine. In reply to which the king
         of Israel said, As thou my lord,       king, hast spoken, I am thine
      5 and all that I have.       Then the messengers returned and said,
         Thus saith Son Ader, I have sent to thee saying, Thy silver
         and thy gold and thy wives and thy children thou shalt give to
      6 me.    Therefore about this time to-morrow I will send my ser-
         vants to thee, and they shall search thy house, and the houses
         of thy servants, and take all that are desirable in their eyes,
      7 upon which they can lay their hands.           Upon this the king of
         Israel called all the elders of the land and said, Mark, I pray
         you and see how this man seeketh mischief.           For he hath sent
         to me for my wives and for my children, even for my daugh-
      8 ters.    My gold and my silver I did not withhold from him.
         Then the elders and all the people said to him, Thou must not
       9 hearken nor consent.      Thereupon he said to the messengers of
         Son Ader, Tell my lord, All that thou didst send to thy ser-
         vant at first I will do ; but this I cannot do.      So the men went
     1   away ; and when they carried him back this answer, Son Ader
         sent to him saying, God do so to me and more also, if I do not
      11 make Samaria a jakes for all the people of my infantry.           In re-
         ply to which the king of Israel said, Enough ! let not him who

       12 is crooked boast like him who is straight.        When this answer
           was delivered him, it happened that he and all the kings with
           him were drinking in tents, thereupon he said to his servants,
           Build up a mount.        And when they had erected a mount
       13 against   the   city, behold a certain prophet came to Achab
           king of Israel and said, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou seen
           this great multitude ?    Behold I deliver them up this day into
       14 thy hands, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.               And
           Achab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the Lord, By
           the younger sons of the chiefs of the communities.      Then Achab
       15 said, Who shall begin the battle?       And he said, Thou.      Upon
          this Achab reviewed the younger sons of the chiefs of the com-
       16 munities and they were two hundred and thirty.        And after that
           he reviewed all the people of the army, seven thousand, and
       17 marched out at noon day.      Now Son Ader was revelling at Sok-
          koth, he and the kings, the thirty two kings his auxiliaries.
          And when the younger sons of the chiefs of the communities
          first marched out, messengers were sent who told the king of
       18 Syria and said, There are men coming out of Samaria.         Where-
          upon he said to them, If they come out for peace, take them
          alive ; or if they come out for battle take them alive and let them
       19 not get away ^out of the city.      The younger sons of the chiefs
          of the communities and the army that followed them had now
       20 smitten every one his man.     And when they repeated this, every
          one slaying his second man, Syria fled and Israel pursued them,
          And Son Ader king of Syria escaped on the horse of a cava-
      21 lier.   And the king of Israel went out and took all the horses
       22 and the chariots.   And when he had smitten Syria with great
          slaughter the prophet came to the king of Israel and said,
          Strengthen thyself and consider and see what thou art to do.
          For at the return of the year Son Ader king of Syria will come
          up against thee.
      23      As for the servants of the king of Syria they said, The God
          of Israel is a god of the mountains and not a god of the vallies ;
          for this cause he prevailed over us.    But if we fight them in the
       24 plain we shall surely be stronger than they.      Therefore do this.
          Send away the kings every one to his home and substitute com-
      25 manders in their stead.      And let us raise for thee another army
          equal to that which is fallen, horse for horse and chariot for
                                                                                                      ;

          chariot.      And we will fight them in the plain and prevail over
     26 them.          So he hearkened to their voice and did accordingly.
          And at the return of the year Son Ader reviewed the Syrians
     27 and came up to Aphek to fight Israel.                         And the Israelites were
          mustered and went out to meet them.                           And when Israel had
          encamped over against them like two little flocks of kids,
          while Syria filled the country, the man of God came and
     28 said to the king of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Because Syria
          hath said, The Lord God of Israel is a god of the moun-
          tains, but he is not a god of the vallies, therefore I will de-
          liver this great army into thy hand, and thou shalt know that
     29 I am the Lord.               So having encamped against each other se-
          ven days, they came to an engagement on the seventh day
     30 and Israel smote of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen
          in one day, and the residue fled to Aphek into the city, and
          the wall fell upon twenty seven thousand of the men who were
          left.    And Son Ader fled, and when he got to the house of his
      31 abode into the inner chamber, he said to his servants, I know
          that the kings of Israel are merciful.                      Let us, I pray you, put
          sackcloth on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and go out to
      32 the king of Israel.            Perhaps he will spare our lives.                   So when
          they had girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their
           heads, they said to the king of Israel, Thus saith thy servant
           Son Ader, Let my life, I pray thee, be spared.                            To which he
      33 replied, Is he still alive ?              He is my brother.             Whereupon the
           men catched up the omen, and using it as a libation, they re-
           peated the word which dropped from his mouth, and said, Thy
           brother, Son Ader.           Then he said, Go in and bring him.                     So he
           came out.        And when they had helped him up to Achab into
      34 the chariot, he said to him, The cities which my father took
           from thy father I will restore to thee.                       And thou shalt make
           streets for thyself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.
      35 On these terms, said Achab, I agree to let thee go.                            And when
           he had entered into covenant with him and let him go ; a cer-
           tain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbour by
           the word of the Lord, Smite me, I pray thee ; but the man
      36 would not smite him.                   Whereupon he said to him, Because
           thou hast not hearkened to the word of the Lord, behold
      37 when thou departest from me a lion will smite thee.                                Accord-

          iiigly when he went from him, a lion met him and slew him.
          Then he met another man and said, Smite me, I pray thee.
       38 And the man smote him, and in smiting, wounded him.     Then
          the prophet went and waited for the king of Israel by the way
       39 side, with a bandage over his eyes.  And as the king was pass-
          ing by, he cried with a loud voice to the king, and said, Thy
           servant went out to the field of battle, and behold a man
           brought me a man, and said to me, Keep this man.   If by any
           means he escape, thy life shall answer for his life, or thou shalt
       40 pay a talent of silver.Now it happened that while thy servant
           was looking about this way and that, he was gone.   And the
           king of Israel said to him, Behold this is treachery. In my
       41 opinion thou art liable to death.   Thereupon he hasted and
           took the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel per-
       42 ceived that he was one of the prophets.   Then he said to him,
           Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast let go out of thy
           hand a destructive man, therefore thy life shall answer for his
       43 life ; and thy people for his people. And the king of Israel
           went away confounded and sorrowful, and came to Samaria,
       XXII. and remained quiet three years, and there was no war be-
           tween Syria and Israel.
        2     But in the third year, when Josaphat king of Juda, came
         3 down to the king of Israel, the king of Israel said to his ser-
           vants, Do you not know that Remmath Galaad belongeth to
         4 us, yet we do not talk of taking it out of the hand of the king
           of Syria. Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Wilt thou
         5 go up with us to Remmath Galaad to battle ?   To which Josa-
           phat replied, I am as thou art ; my people as thy people ; my
           horses as thy horses.Then Josaphat said to the king of Israel,
         6 Inquire I pray thee of the Lord.   Whereupon the king of Is-
           rael assembled all the prophets, about four hundred men, and said
           to them, Shall I go up to Remmath Galaad to battle, or shall I
           forbear ? And they said, Go up ; for the Lord will certainly de-
         7 liver into the king's hands.And Josaphat said to the king of
           Israel, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord that we may in-
         8 quire of the Lord by him ? And the king of Israel said to Josa-
           phat, There is a certain man by whom we may inquire of the
           Lord, but I hate him ; for he never speaketh good of me ; but
         9 evilâ€”one Michaias, son of Jemblaa.   And Josaphat king of
      98
    Ch. XXII.               III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
        Juda said, Let not the king speak so.            Then the king of Is-
        rael called a chamberlain, and said, Bring here quickly Mi-
    10 chaias son of Jemblaa,         Now the king of Israel and Josaphat
        king of Juda was seated each on his throne, clad in armour,
        in the gate of Samaria; aud all the prophets were prophesying
    11 before them.       And Sedekias son of Chanaan made for himself
        horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the Lord, with these thou
    12 shalt push Syria until he be utterly destroyed.               And in like
        manner all the prophets prophesied, saying, Go up to Rem-
        math Galaad, for the Lord will prosper the journey and de-
    13 liver into thy hands the king of Syria.            So the messenger who
        went to call Michaias, spoke to him saying, Behold all the
        prophets with one mouth speak good things concerning the
        king, conform, I pray thee, thy words to the words of every of
    14 them, and speak good things.            To which Michaias replied, As
        the Lord liveth, whatever the Lord shall say to me, that will I
    15 speak.     And when he came before the king, the king said to
        him, Michaias, shall I go up to Bemmath Galaad to battle, or
        shall I forbear ?     And he said, Go up, and the Lord will deliver
    16 into the king's hand !        Then the king said to him, How often
        must I adjure thee that thou shouldst speak truth to me in the
    17 name ofthe Lord ?         Thereupon he said, Is not this the case?          I
        saw all Israel dispersed on the mountains like a flock which
        hath no shepherd ; and the Lord said, Is not the Lord, their
     1  God? Let every one return to his house in peace.                 Then the
        king of Israel said to Josaphat, Did I not tell thee that he
         would not prophesy good to me, for he never speaketh any
     1   thing but evils ?     Whereupon Michaias said, It is not so.          It is
         not I.   Hear a word of the Lord.         Is not this the case ?     I saw
         the God of Israel seated on his throne, and all the hosts of
         heaven stood around him, some on the right and some on the
     20 left.   And the Lord said, Who will deceive Achab king of Is-
         rael that he may go up and fall at Bemmath Galaad ?                   And
     21 when one spoke in this manner and another in that, there came
         forth a spirit and stood before the Lord, and said, I will deceive
     22 him.    And the Lord said to him, How ?           And he said, I will go
         out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.
         And he said, Thou shalt deceive him and actually prevail.
     23 Go and do so.        Now therefore behold the Lord hath put a lv-
        Ch. XXII.          III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
           ing spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of thine ; but the
        24 Lord hath spoken evils against thee.    Thereupon Sedekias
           son of Chanaan went near and smote Michaias on the cheek,
           and said, What sort of a spirit of the Lord is that which hath
        25 spoken by thee?    To which Michaias replied, Behold thou
           shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into thy inmost cham-
        26 ber to hide thyself there.Then the king of Israel said, Take
        27 Michaias and carry him back to Semer, the ruler of the city,
           and tell Joas, the ruler's son, to put him in ward and feed him
           with the bread of affliction, and water of affliction, till I return
        28 in peace. And Michaias said, If thou return in peace, the Lord
           hath not spoken by me.
        29    Then the king of Israel went up, and Josaphat the king of
        30 Juda with him, to Eemmath Galaad.    And the king of Israel
           said to the king of Juda, I will disguise myself and enter into
           the battle, and thou shalt put on my raiment. So the king of
        31 Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.  Now the
           king of Syria had given a charge to the thirty two command-
           ers of his chariots, saying, Fight not with small or great, but
        32 only with the king of Israel.Accordingly when the command-
           ers of the chariots saw Josaphat, king of Juda, they said,
           This appeareth to be the king of Israel, and wheeled about to
        33 fight him, and Josaphat uttered a loud cry.   And when the
           commanders of the chariots saw that he was not the king of
        34 Israel, they turned back from him.  Then one drew a bow at
           a venture and smote the king of Israel between the lungs and
           the breast.  Whereupon he said to his charioteer, Turn thy
        35 hand and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.   As
           the battle was that day disastrous the king remained in his
           chariot over against the Syrians from morning till evening,
           and the blood flowed from the wound into the body of the
        36 chariot. And at the going down of the sun the herald of the
           army stood and made proclamation, saying, Every man to his
        37 city and to his own land ; for the king is dead.  And when
           they came to Samaria they buried the king in Samaria, and
        38 washed off the blood at the fountain of Samaria, and the swine
           and the dogs licked the blood, and the prostitutes bathed
           themselves in the blood, according to the word of the Lord
        39 which he spoke.   Now the rest of the acts of Achab and all
      Cb. XXII.             III. KINGSâ€”I. KINGS.
         that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the
         cities which he founded, behold are they not written in the
      40 book of the journal of the kings of Israel?        And when Achab
         slept with his fathers, Ochozias his son reigned in his stead.
      41     Now Josaphat son of Asa was king over Juda.                In the
         fourth year of Achab, king of Israel, Josaphat began his reign.
         He was thirty five years of age when he began to reign, and
         he reigned twenty five years in Jerusalem, and his mother's
      43 name was Azuba, a daughter of Salai.          And he walked in all
         the way of his father Asa, and deviated not from it, doing
         what was right in the sight of the Lord.         But he did not re-
      44 move the high places.       Still the people sacrificed and burned
         incense on the high places.       And Josaphat was at peace with
      45 the king of Israel.     Now the rest of the acts of Josaphat, and
         all the exploits which he did, behold are they not written in the
      .30 book of the journal of the kings of Juda ?       And Josaphat slept
          with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
         David his father, and Joram his son reigned in his stead.
      51     Ochozias son of Achab, began his reign over Israel, in Sa-
         maria, in the seventeenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, and
      52 reigned over Israel in Samaria two years.         He did that which
         was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his
         father Achab, and in the way of his mother Jezabel, and in the
         sins of the house of Jeroboam son of Nabat, who made Israel
         sin, and served the Baalims and worshipped them, and pro-
         voked the Lord God of Israel according to all that had been
         done before him.
                            IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
     I.        After the death of Achab, Moab broke covenant with
       2 Israel.   xVnd Ochozias fell through the lattice in his upper
         chamber at Samaria, and was sick, whereupon he sent messen-
          gers, saying to them, Go and inquire of Baal the fly-god of Ak-
       3 karon, whether I shall recover from this sickness of mine.        And
         when they set out to inquire of him, the angel of the Lord
         called Elias the Thesbite, and said, Arise and go, meet the
         messengers of Ochozias king of Samaria, and say to them, Is
         it because there is not a God in Israel, that you are going to
       Ch. I.                   IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
         4 inquire of Baal the fly-god of Akkaron ?              Now is not this the
           case, saith the Lord, From the bed to which thou art gone up
         5 thou shalt not come down, for thou shalt assuredly die?                     So
            Elias went and spoke to them, and the messengers returned to
         6 the king.      Thereupon he said to them, Why are you returned ?
            To which they replied, There came up a man to meet us, and
            he said to us, Go, return to the king who sent you and say to
            him, Thus saith the Lord, Is it because there is not a God in
            Israel, that thou goest to inquire of Baal, the fly-god of Akka-
            ron ?   Now is not this the case ; From the bed to which thou
            hast gone up thou shalt not come down, for thou shalt assu-
         7 redly die ?     Now when they who returned told the king what
            Elias had said, he said to them, What sort of a man was he
            who came up to meet you, and spoke these words to you ?
         8 And they said to him, He was a hairy man, girt about the
            loins with a leathern girdle.            Upon which he said, This is
         9 Elias the Thesbite.       Then he sent to him a captain of fifty with
            his fifty, who went up to him.           Now behold Elias was sitting
            on the top of the mount.         And when the captain spoke to him
            and said, Man of God, the king hath sent for thee, come down.
        10 Elias, in reply, said to the captain, If I be a man of God, let fire
            come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty.                      So
            there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his
        11 fifty.    But the king persisted, and sent to him another captain
            of fifty with his fifty.     And the captain spoke to him and said,
            Man of God, thus saith the king, Come down quickly.
        12    Thereupon Elias in reply, said to him, If I be a man of God,
            W
            let  fire  come down from heaven and consume thee and thy
            fifty.   Accordingly there came down fire from heaven and con-
        13 sumed him and his fifty.            Still the king persisted, and sent
            another captain and his fifty.        But when the third captain came
            he fell upon his knees before Elias, and with entreaties address-
            ed him, saying,         man of God, let my life and the lives of thy
        14 servants, these fifty, be precious in thy sight.           Behold, fire hath
             come down from heaven and consumed the two former cap-
             tains of fifty ; but now let my life, I beseech thee, be precious
        15 in thy sight.       Then the angel of the Lord spoke to Elias, and
        16 said, Go down with him ; be not afraid of them.                      So Elias
             arose and went down with him to the king.                And Elias spoke
     Ch. II.              IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
         to him and said, Thus saith the Lord, Why didst thou send
         messengers to inquire of Baal the fly-god of Akkaron ?    Is not
         this the case ? From the bed to which thou hast gone up thou
     17 shalt not come down : for thou shalt assuredly die ?   So he died
     IS according to the word of the Lord, which Elias spake.        Now
         the rest of the acts of Ochozias which he did, behold are they
         not written in the book of the journal of the kings of Israel ?
         And Joram son of Achab reigned over Israel in Samaria, twelve
        years, commencing in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of
         Juda.  And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not in the
        manner his brothers, nor as his mother had done.       He indeed
        removed the pillars of Baal which his father had erected, and
        broke them to pieces.    Nevertheless he adhered to the sins of
        the house of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin, and did
        not depart from them.      Therefore the Lord was provoked to
        wrath against the house of Achab.
     II.    Now when the Lord was about to take up Elias as it were
        with a whirlwind into heaven, Elias went with Elisha from
      2 Galgala.   Now Elias had said to Elisha, Tarry here I pray
        thee, for God hath sent me to Baithel.   But Elisha said, As the
        Lord liveth and thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  So they
      3 went to Baithel.    And the sons of the prophets who were at
        Baithel, came to Elisha and said to him, Dost thou know that
        the Lord will take thy master to-day from over thy head?
      4 And he said, I know it.      Hold your peace.    Then Elias said
        to Elisha, Tarry here I pray thee ; for the Lord hath sent me
        to Jericho.   But he said, As the Lord liveth, and thy soul
      5 liveth, I will not forsake thee. So they went to Jericho.    And
        the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho, came to Elisha
        and said to him, Dost thou know that to-day the Lord will
        take away thy master from over thy head?         And he said, I
      6 indeed know it ; hold your peace.      Then Elias said to him,
        Tarry here I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me to the Jor-
        dan.   But Elisha replied, As the Lord liveth and thy soul liveth,
      7 I will not leave thee.   So they both proceeded on.    And fifty
        men, sons of the prophets stood over against them at a distance
      8 when they two stopped at the Jordan.    And Elias took his man-
        tle and having rolled it up, he smote the water, and the water
        parted this way and that, so that they both crossed on dry
            II.              IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
       Ch.
         9 ground.    And when they had crossed, Elias said to Elisha,
           Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken up from thee.
           Whereupon Elisha said, Let there be, I pray thee, a double por-
       10 tion of thy spirit on me.     And Elias said, Thou hast put me
           to a stand by this request.     If thou seest me taken up from
           thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not; it cannot be granted.
       11 And as they proceeded on conversing as they went, behold a
           chariot of fire, with horses of fire, made a separation between
           them ; and Elias was carried up with a whirlwind as it were into
       12 heaven.    And Elisha saw and cried with a loud voice, My father !
           my father !   The chariot of Israel and the driver thereof !   And
           when he saw him no more, he took hold of his garment and
       13 rent it in two pieces.     Then he took up the mantle of Elias
           which fell from on high, and on his return back, he stood on
        14 the bank of the Jordan, and took the mantle of Elias which
           had fallen from him, and smote the water and said, Where
           is the God of Elias now !    And when he had smitten the waters
        15 they parted this way and that, so Elisha crossed over.         And
           when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against
           him, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elias hath rested on
           Elisha, so they went to meet him, and made obeisance to him
        1G by bowing to the ground.        Then they said to him, Behold
           there are with thy servants fifty valiant men.       Let them, we
           pray thee, go and seek thy master.        Perhaps a blast of the
           Lord hath lifted him up and cast him by the Jordan, either on
        17 one of the mountains, or one of the hills.       And Elisha said,
           You shall not send.     But when they pressed him till he was
        18 ashamed, he said, Send.     So they sent fifty men.     And when
           they had searched three clays, but did not find him, they re-
           turned to Elisha, who abode at Jericho.        And Elisha said to
           them, Did I not tell you, you should not go ?
        19     Then the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold the situ-
           ation of the city is good as our lord seeth, but the water is bad
        20 and the ground barren.     Thereupon Elisha said to them, Bring
        21 me a new pitcher and put salt therein.        And when they had
            got one and brought it to him, Elisha went to the spring of
            the waters, and threw the salt in there and said, Thus saith the
            the Lord, I cure the waters.     There shall no more be thence
        22 death or barren ground.        So the waters were healed, and
                                                                                                                                      !
         Ch. III.                              IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
                continue so to this day, according to the word which Elisha
                spoke.
         23           Then he went up thence to Baithel, and as he was going up
               he met in the way, little boys who had come out of the city,
         24 and who mocked him saying, Ascend bald head !                                                               Ascend
               And looking back upon them, he beheld them, and denounced
               a curse against them, in the. name of the Lord.                                                   And behold
               there came two bears from the forest, and they tore forty two
         25 of the boys.                   Thence he went to mount Karmel, and thence
               returned to Samaria.
        III.            Now Joram son of Achab, began his reign in Israel in the
          2 eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, and reigned twelve
               years, and did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not like his
          3 father nor his mother.                           He indeed removed the pillars of Baal
               which his father had erected ; but he adhered to the sin of Je-
              roboam son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin, and did
          -i  not depart from that.                        Now Mosa king of Moab, was a Noked
               [one who paid tribute in sheep] and rebelliously withheld
               from the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hun-
          5 dred thousand rams with the wool.                                     And it happened that after
              the death of Achab, when the king of Moab broke covenant
          6 with Israel, king Joram was at that time gone from Samaria and
          7 was reviewing Israel.                         So he proceeded on and sent to Josaphat
              king of Juda, saying, The king of Moab hath broken cove-
              nant with me, wilt thou go with me to battle against Moab ?
              To which he replied, I will go up.                                    He is the same to me as
              he is to thee.                My people is as thy people ; my horses as thy
          8 horses.           Then he said, Which way must I go up ?                                                To which
          9 he answered, By the way to the wilderness of Edom.                                                           So the
              king of Israel and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom,
              went out and took a circuit of seven days, and there was no
              water for the army nor for the cattle which attended them.
       10 And when the king of Israel said, Alas ! for the Lord hath
              called the three kings who have come thus far, to deliver them
       11 into the hand of Moab ; Josaphat said, Is there not here a pro-
              phet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord by him ?
              Whereupon one of the king of Israel's servants in reply, said,
              Elisha son of Saphat is here, who poured water on the hands
       12 of Elias.               And Josaphat said, The word of the Lord is with
                    vol. I.                                        4 I
                                Ch. III.                                                                                EV. KINGS-II. KINGS.
                                              him.                        So the king of Israel, with Josaphat king of Juda and
                                13 the king of Edom, went down to him.                                                                                                                                                    And Elisha said to the
                                              king of Israel, What hast thou to do with me ?                                                                                                                                                               Go to the pro-
                                             phets of thy father and the prophets of thy mother. And the king
                                             of Israel said to him, I am fearful that the Lord hath called these
                               14 three kings to deliver them into the hands of Moab.                                                                                                                                                                                              To which
                                             Elisha replied, As the Lord of hosts liveth in whose presence
                                             I stand, were it not that I respect the person of Josaphat king
                              15 of Juda, I would not look on thee nor see thee.                                                                                                                                                                            But now bring
                              16 me a musician.                                                                        And when the musician played, the hand of
                               17 the Lord came upon him, and he said, Thus saith the Lord,
                                             Make this valley full of ditches.                                                                                                               For thus saith the Lord, You
                                             shall not see wind nor shall you see rain, nevertheless this val-
                                             ley shall be filled with water that you and your beasts and your
                               IS cattle may drink.                                                                            And this is but a small matter in the eyes of
                               19 the Lord; for I will deliver Moab into your hands, and you
                                             shall smite every fenced city, and cut down every goodly tree.
                                             And all the wells of water you shall stop up, and every good
                              20 piece of ground you shall mar with stones.                                                                                                                                                               Accordingly in the
                                             morning when the sacrifice ascended, behold there came water
                                             by the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.
                               21                           Now all Moab upon hearing that the three kings were
                                             coming to fight against them, had sounded the alarm, To arms
                                            from every place all who ivear a girdle, and having repeated the
                              22 alarm Wo, were drawn up at their border.                                                                                                                                                                             And when they
                                              arose in the morning and the sun shone on the waters, the Mo-
                                              abites saw the waters over against them red like blood, and
                               23 said, This is the blood of the sword.                                                                                                                                               The kings have fought
                                              and every man hath slain his fellow, now therefore to the
                               24 spoils,                                             Moab!                                But when they came to the camp of Israel,
                                              the Israelites arose and smote Moab.                                                                                                                                           And as the Moabites
                                              fled before them they entered the country advancing and smit-
                               25 ing Moab.                                                          The cities they demolished, and on every good
                                                                                                                                                                             fc
                                              piece of ground they threw, every man his stone.                                                                                                                                                                                And when
                                              they had filled it and stopped up every fountain, and cut down
                                              every goodly tree, until they left only the stones of the wall of
                                              Katheremenus, then the slingers surrounded this and smote
                                26 it.                          And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too
                                               strong for him, he took with him seven hundred men who
                                                                           â€”;
     Ch. IV.               IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
         drew the sword, to cut their way through to the kiug of Edoin.
     27 But wheu he could not, he took his son, his first born, whom
         he had made king in his stead, and offered him up as a whole
         burnt offering on the walls.     Upon which great commiseration
         came upon Israel, and they departed from him, and returned
         into their own land.
     IV.      When a woman, a widow, of one of the sons of the pro-
         phets cried to Elisha, saying, Thy servant, my husband, is
         dead, and thou knowest that thy servant was one who feared the
         Lord, and the creditor is come to take my two sons to be his
      2 slaves, Elisha said to her, What can I do for thee ?        Tell me
         What hast thou in thy house ?       To which she replied, Thy ser-
         vant hath nothing in the house, but only the oil with which I
      3 anoint myself.    Thereupon he said to her, Go and borrow of all
      4 thy neighbours empty vessels.       Spare not in borrowing.      Then
         go in and shut the door on thee and thy sons, and pour out into
      5 these vessels, setting aside that which is full.   So she went away
         from him; and having shut the door on herself and her sons,
         they brought to her and she poured out until the vessels were
      6 filled.  And when she said to her sons, Bring me another ves-
        sel, and they replied, There is not a vessel more, the oil stop-
      7 ped.   Then she went and told the man of God, and Elisha said
        to her, Go and sell the oil and pay thy debts, and live thou and
         thy children on the oil which is left.
      8     It happened also that one day when Elisha went to Soman,
        a woman of rank there prevailed on him to eat bread.         So as oft
      9 as he went thither he called in to eat.      Whereupon the woman
        said to her husband, Behold I perceive that the man of God
     10 this holy man passeth by us on all occasions, let us I pray thee,
        prepare for him a small room up stairs, and let us put there for
        him a bed and a table and a chair and a lamp, so that when he
     11 cometh to us he may turn in thither.      So one day when he went
        there he turned aside into the chamber, and having slept there,
     12 he said to his servant Giezi, Call me this Somanite.      So he call-
     13 ed her and she stood before him.       (Now he had said to his ser-
        vant, Say, I pray thee, to her, Behold as thou hast taken all
        this trouble for us, what must I do for thee ?       Hast thou any
        message to send to the king or to the general of the army?
        And she had said to him, I indeed dwell in the midst of my
                                                                                                                               !;
             Ch. IV.                           IV. KINGSâ€”IT. KINGS.
             14 people.           Upon which he said to Giezi, What can be done for
                   her ?      And his servant Giezi replied, She indeed hath not a son
             15 and her husband is old.)                          So when he had called her and she
             16 stood at the door, Elisha said to her, This time twelve month,
                  about this very hour thou alive and well hast embraced a son.
                  To which she replied, Nay, my lord, do not deceive thy hand-
            17 maid.           So the woman conceived and bore a son about that time
                  twelve month, about the very hour, being alive and well as Eli-
             18 sha said to her.                But when the child grew up, happening to go
                  out to his father to the reapers, he said to his father, My head
            19 my head !              Whereupon he said to the servant, Carry him to his
            20 mother.             So he carried him to his mother, and he lay on her lap
            21 till noon and died.                    And when she had carried him up and laid
                  him on the bed of the man of God, she shut the door on him
            22 and came out and called her husband and said, Send me, I pray
                  thee, one of the servants and one of the asses that I may go
            23 speedily to the man of God and return.                                        And he said to her,
                  Why wouldst thou go to him to-day ?                                    It is neither new moon
            24 nor sabbath.                 To which she replied, Peace.                            So when he had
                  saddled the ass, she said to her servant, Come, drive on.                                            Slack
                  not thy gait for me, unless I order thee.                                   Come, press forward
             25 and go to the man of God to mount Karmel.                                          So she proceeded
                   on and came to the man of God to the mount.                                       Now Elisha saw
                   her coming and said to his servant Giezi, Behold yonder is the
             26 Somanite, run and meet her and say, Is it well with thee ?                                               Is it
                   well with thy husband ?                    Is it well with the child ?                 And she said,
             27 It is well.            But when she came to Elisha on the mount, she took
                   hold of his feet, whereupon Giezi went near to push her back.
                   But Elisha said, Let her alone : for her soul is full of sorrow
                   and the Lord hath hid the cause from me and hath not told me.
             28 Then she said, Did I ask a son of my lord ?                                       Did I not say, Do
             29 not deceive me.                   Thereupon Elisha said to Giezi, Gird up thy
                   loins and take my staff in thy hand and go.                                    If thou meetest a
                   man salute him not.                   And if any man salute thee, return him no
             30 answer.           And lay my staff on the face of the child.                                But the mo-
                   ther of the child said, As the Lord liveth and thy soul liveth
             31 I will not leave thee.                      So Elisha arose and followed her.                           Now
                   Giezi had gone before her and laid the staff on the child's face
                   but there was no voice, nor attention.                               So when he came back
   Ch. V.              IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
   32 and met him he said to him, The child is not awaked.      And
       when Elisha came to the house, behold the child was dead and
   33 laid upon his bed.   Then Elisha went into the house and shut
       the door upon them two ; and having prayed to the Lord he
   34 went up and lay down upon the child and put his mouth on the
       child's mouth, and his eyes on its eyes, and his hands on its
       hands, and bent himself down upon it ; and the flesh of the child
   35 was warmed.    Then he withdrew, and when he had walked
       backward and forward in the house, he went up and bent him-
       self upon the child seven times, and the child opened its eyes.
    36 Whereupon Elisha called Giezi and said, Call the Somanite.
   37 So he called her.   And when she came to him, Elisha said,
       Take up thy son.  Thereupon she came and fell at his feet, and
       having made obeisance to him by bowing to the ground she
       took up her son and went out.
   38     When Elisha returned to Galgala there was a famine in the
       land, and the sons of the prophets sat before him. And Elisha
       said to his servant, Put on the large kettle and boil some pot-
    39 tage for the sons of the prophets. And one went out into the
       fields to gather herbs, and having found a vine in the fields he
       gathered from it a lapful of wild berries and threw them into the
    40 kettle of soup ; for they did not know them. Then they poured out
       for the men to eat : but when they had eaten of the pottage, behold
       they cried out and said, There is death in the kettle, man of
    41 God : for they could not eat.  Whereupon he said, Take some
       meal and throw it into the kettle. Then Elisha said to his ser-
       vant Giezi, Pour out for the people and let them eat.     And
    42 there was no more any thing disagreeable in the kettle.  After
       that there came a man from Baithariso and brought to the man
       of God, of the first fruits twenty loaves of barley bread and
    43 some fig cakes.  And he said, Give these to the people and let
       them eat.  And when his servant said, Why should I set this
       before a hundred men ? he said, Give it to the people and let
    44 them eat ; for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat and leave.So
       they ate and left according to the word of the Lord.
    V.      Nairaan the captain general of the army of Syria, was a man
       great in the sight of his master and highly honoured ; because
       by him the Lord had given deliverance to Syria.  But this man
     2 who was mighty in power, was leprous.    Now the light armed
         Ch. V.              IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
            bands had gone from Syria and brought away captive out of
            the land of Israel, a little girl and she waited on Naiman's wife.
          3 And she said to her mistress,      that my master were before
            the prophet of God who is in Samaria: Then would he cure
          4 him of his leprosy.  And she went in and told her lord and said,
            Thus and thus hath the little girl spoken, who is from the
          5 land of Israel.  Upon this the king of Syria said to Naiman,
            Come, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.    So
            he set out and took with him ten talents of silver and six thou-
            sand pieces of gold and ten suits of apparel and carried the
          6 letter to the king of Israel, the purport of which was, Now
            when this letter shall come to thee, behold I have sent to thee
            my servant Naiman that thou mayst cure him of his leprosy.
          7 And when the king of Israel had read the letter he rent his
            clothes and said, Am I God to kill or give life, that he send-
            eth to me to cure a man of his leprosy ?    For only consider, I
            pray you, and see how he seeketh a pretence for quarreling
          8 with me.   But when Elisha heard that the king of Israel had
            rent his clothes he sent to him saying, Why hast thou rent
            thy clothes ?  Let Naiman come to me and know that there is
          9 a prophet in Israel. So Naiman went with his horses and cha-
        10 riot and stopped at the doors of Elisha's house.     And Elisha
            sent a messenger to him saying, Go and wash thyself seven
            times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall return to thee and thou
        11 shalt be cleansed.   Thereupon Naiman was inflamed with in-
            indignation and went away saying, Behold I thought he would
            at least come out and stand and call on the name of his God,
        12 or lay his hand on the place, and cure the leprous part.     Are
            not Abana and Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than
            all the waters of Israel?    Why may I not go and wash in
            them, and be cleansed ?    So he turned and went away in a
        13 rage.   But his servants drew near and said to him, Had the
            prophet enjoined thee some great thing, wouldst thou not do
        14 it ?  And wilt thou not, because he said, Wash and be clean ?
            Then Naiman went down, and when he had dipped himself
            seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the pro-
            phet, his flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and
        15 he was cleansed.   Upon this he and all his retinue, returned to
            Elisha, and came and stood before him and said, Behold I
                                                                                                                        ;
      Ch. V.                             IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
            now know that there is not a God in all the earth but only in Is-
            rael.      Now therefore accept this acknowledgment, from thy
      16 servant.            But Elisha said, As the Lord liveth in whose pre-
      17 sence I stand, I will not receive it.                               And when he urged him
            to take it and he refused, Naiman said, But if not ; pray let
            there be given to thy servant a couple of mules burden of earth
            for thy servant will no more offer a whole burnt offering or
            a sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord.                                        But in this
      18 thing may the Lord be gracious to thy servant.                                                When my
            master goeth into the house of Kemman to worship there,
            should he lean on my hand, and I bow down in the house of
            Kemman, when he boweth down there, may the Lord, I pray,
      19 be gracious to thy servant in this respect.                                        And Elisha said
      20 to Naiman, Go in peace.                          Now when he had gone a little way
            from him, Giezi the servant of Elisha said, Behold my master
            hath spared Naiman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hand
            what he brought.                  As the Lord liveth, I will run after him,
            and receive something from him.                                So Giezi went after Nai-
      21 man with all speed.                      And when Naiman saw him running after
      22 him, he turned about from his chariot to meet him.                                                 And he
            said, Peace ! My master hath sent me saying, Behold there
            are just come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of
            the sons of the prophets.                       Give, I pray thee for them a talent
      23 of silver and two suits of apparel.                               To which he replied, Take
            two talents of silver.                  So he took two talents of silver, in two
            bags, and two suits of raiment and laid them on two of his
      24 servants and they carried them before him.                                      And when he came
            to a dark place, he took them from the hands of his servants,
      25 and laid them up in the house.                                 And'when he had dismissed
            the men, he went in and stood before his master.                                         And Elisha
            said to him, Whence comest thou, Giezi?                                        To which he re-
      26 plied, Thy servant hath not gone any where.                                          And Elisha said
            to him, My heart indeed did not go with thee, when the man
            turned about from his chariot to meet thee.                                       Now thou hast
            received silver; and thou hast now received the apparel and
            olive yards and vine yards, and flocks and herds and men ser-
      27 vants, and maid servants; but the leprosy of Naiman shall
            cleave to thee, and thy seed forever.                              So he went out from bis
            presence, leprous like snow.
               1                                                                                                       ;!
              Gh. VI.                         IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
             VI.          When the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold
                   the place where we dwell before thee it too confined for us
               2 let us we pray thee, go to the Jordan, and take thence every
                   man a piece of timber, and build there for ourselves a dwell-
               3 ing, and he said, Go ; one of them intreated him saying, Come
                   along with thy servants ; and he said I will go.                                  So he went
                4 with them.           And when they came to the Jordan and were cut-
               5 ting the timber, behold as one was felling the beam the ax
                   dropped in the water.                  Upon which he cried out,                       my lord
               6 Now it was quite hid.                    And the man of God said, Where did
                   it fall ?     And when he had shewed him the place, he cut a chip
                   of wood and threw it there, and the ax swam on the surface.
               7 And he said, Take it up.                      So he stretched forth his hand and
                   took it up.
               8        When the king of Syria was carrying on a war against Is-
                   rael, and consulted with his servants saying, In such and such
               9 a place I will encamp in ambush, Elisha sent to the king of
                   Israel saying, Take care not to pass by such a place, for the
             10 Syrians lie concealed there.                     And when the king of Israel sent
                   to the place which Elisha mentioned, and avoided it more
                   than once or twice, the heart of the king of Syria was moved
              1    at this.      And he called his servants and said to them, Why will
                   you not tell me, who it is that betrayeth me to the king of Israel ?
              12 Thereupon one of his servants said, That is not the case, my
                   lord,       king !      For it is Elisha the prophet in Israel who tell-
                   eth the king of Israel all the words which thou speakest in
             13 thy bed chamber.                   Then he said, Go see where he is, and I
             14 will send and take him.                     And when they told him saying, Be-
                   hold he is at Dothaim, he sent thither horses and chariots,
             15 even a strong detachment.                       And they came by night and sur-
                   rounded the city.              And when Elisha's servant arose early in
                   the morning and went out, behold an army with horses and
                   chariots surrounded the city, whereupon the servant said to
             16 him,            my lord, what shall we do?                        And Elisha said, Fear
             17 not; for there are more with us than with them.                                     Then Elisha
                   prayed and said,                 Lord I beseech thee, open his eyes that
                   he may see.            Accordingly the Lord opened his eyes and he
                   looked and lo ! the mountain was full of horses and chariots of
             18 fire around Elisha.                And as the Syrians were coming down up-
                   on him Elisha prayed to the Lord and said, Smite I pray thee,
    Cb. VI.           IV. KINGS-II. KINGS.
    19 this people with dimness of sight.And when he had smitten
       them with dimness of sight, according to the word of Elisha,
       Elisha said to them, This is not the city ; nor this the way.
    20 Come, follow me, and I will lead you to the man whom you
       are seeking. So he led them away to Samaria ; and when they
       had entered Samaria, Elisha said, Open,    Lord, I beseech
       thee, their eyes, and let them see.So he opened their eyes
       and looked, and behold they were in the midst of Samaria.
   21 Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha,
    22 My father, shall I smite them?  To which lie replied, Thou
       must not smite them.  Dost thou smite any but those whom
       thou hast captivated with thy own sword, or thy own bow?
       Set bread and water before them and let them eat and drink,
   23 and go to their lord.  So he made a great entertainment for
       them.  And when they had eaten and drunk he dismissed
       them, and they went to their master, and the predatory bands
       of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
   24     After this, Son Ader king of Syria, assembled his whole
       army and came up and sat down before Samaria, and there was
   25 a great famine in Samaria.  For behold they besieged it until
       an ass's head was sold for fifty shekels of silver, and a quarter of
   26 a kab of vetches for five shekels of silver. And as the king of Is-
       rael was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him and said,
   27 Save me, my lord,   king !  And the king said to her, Unless
       the Lord save thee, whence can I save thee, from the threshing
   28 floor or from the press? Then the king said to her, What is
      the matter with thee ? And the woman said, This woman said
      to me, Give thy son that we may eat him to-day; and we will
   29 eat my son to-morrow.   So when we had boiled my son and
      eaten him, I said to her on the next day, Give thy son that we
   30 may eat him ; but she hath hidden her son.  When the king
      of Israel heard the words of the woman he rent his clothes, as
      he was passing along on the wall, so that all the people saw the
   31 sackcloth underneath on his flesh.And he said, God do so to
      me and more also, if the head of Elisha shall stand on him this
   32 day.  Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were
      sitting with him. And when the king despatched a man before
      him; before the messenger came to him he said to the elders,
      Do you see that this son of a murderer hatli sent to take off my
         vol. i.                  4 k
        Cb. VII.            IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
            head ?  Look ! when the messenger conieth, shut the door and
            stop him there.  Is not the sound of his master's feet behind
        33 him? And while he was speaking with them, behold the mes-
            senger came down to him.     And when the king said, Behold
            this calamity is from the Lord ; why should I wait any longer
        VII.   for the Lord ?   Elisha replied, Hear a word of the Lord,
            Thus saith the Lord, About this time to-morrow, a measure of
            fine flour for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,
         2 in the gates of Samaria.  Upon this a nobleman on whose hand
            the king leaned, in reply to Elisha said, Behold should the
            Lord make flood gates in heaven, can such a thing be ?    And
            Elisha replied, Behold thou shalt see it with thy eyes but shalt
            not eat thereof.
         3     Now there were four lepers before the gate of the city, and
         4 one said to another, Why sit we here till we die ?    If we say,
            let us go into the city ; there is a famine in the city and we
            must die there. And if we stay here we must die.    Now there-
            fore come, let us desert to the camp of Syria ; if they take us
            alive we may live ; and if they put us to death, we can but die.
          5 So they arose when it was dark to go to the Syrian camp.
         6 But when they came to a part of the camp of Syria ; behold
            there was not a man there.  For the Lord had caused the sound
            of chariots and the sound of horses, and the sound of a great
            army to be heard in the Syrian camp : whereupon they said
            one to another, Now hath the king of Israel hired against us
            the kings of the Chettites and the kings of Egypt to come upon
         7 us.   Therefore they arose and fled while it was dark.     They
            left their tents and their horses and their asses in the camp as
         8 it was, and fled for their lives. So when the lepers came to a
            part of the camp they went into a tent and ate and drank, and
            carried thence silver and gold and raiment, and went away.
            And returning again they went into another tent and took
          9 things out of it and hid them.   Then one said to another, We
            should not do so.   This is a day of good news.  Should we be
            silent and wait till the morning light, we shall incur guilt. Now
            therefore, come, let us go and inform the king's household.
        10 Accordingly they came and cried with a loud voice at the gate
            of the city and told them the news, saying, We have been to
            the camp of Syria and behold there is not a man there, nor the
    Ch. VIII.            IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
       sound of a man.   For there is nothing there but the horses and
    11 the asses tied, and the tents as they were.And when the watch-
       men at the gates cried and told the king's household within, the
    12 king arose and said to his servants, Let me tell you what Sy-
       ria hath done to us.   They know that we are famishing, there-
       fore they have left their camp and hid themselves in the fields,
       saying, They will come out of the city and we shall take them
    13 alive and enter the city.  To this one of his servants said in re-
       ply, Pray let them take five of the remaining horses which are
       left here, behold they are nearly all the multitude belonging to
    14 Israel which are left : and let us send thither and see. So they
       took two horsemen, and the king of Israel sent them after the
    15 king of Syria, saying, Go and see.  Andtheywent on after them
       as far as the Jordan.  And behold all the way was full of clothes
       and vessels, which the Syrians had thrown away in their pa-
       nick fright.  And when the messengers returned and told the
       king, the people went out and plundered the camp of Syria.
    16 So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, aud two mea-
       sures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord.
    17 Now the king had stationed at the gate the nobleman on whose
       hand he had leaned, but the people trode him down so that he
       died, according to the saying of the man of God, who spoke to
    18 him when the messenger came down to him.        For when Elisha
        spoke to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel
        and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, and this shall be about
    19 this time to-morrow in the gate of Samaria ; this nobleman an-
        swered and said to Elisha, Behold should the Lord make flood
        gates in heaven, could this be ? Thereupon Elisha said, Behold
        thou shalt see with thy eyes but shalt not eat thereof.And so it
        fell out : For the people trampled him down at the gate, so that
        he died.
    VIII.     Elisha having spoken to the woman whose son he
        had restored to life, saying, Arise and go thou and thy family
        and sojourn where thou canst ; for the Lord hath called for
      2 a famine against this land, and it is come upon the land for seven
        years ; the woman arose and did according to the word of Eli-
      3 sha, and both she and her family sojourned in the land of the
        Philistines seven years.  And at the end of the seven years, the
        woman returned from the land of the Philistines to the citv,
        Ch. VIII.             IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
           and went to apply to the king about her house and her fields.
         4 Now the king had spoken to Giezi, the servant of Elisha, the
           man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things
         5 which Elisha hath done.       And it happened that as he was re-
            lating how he had brought to life a son that was dead, behold
            the woman whose son Elisha had restored to life, applied to
           the king about her house and her fields.        And Giezi said, My
            Lord the king !    This is the woman, and this is her son, whom
         6 Elisha restored to life.    Upon which the king inquired of the
            woman, and when she told him, the king appointed for her an
            officer, and said, Eestore all that belonged to her, and all the
            produce of the fields from the day she left the land even to
            this day.
         7     When Elisha went to Damascus, Son Ader king of Syria
         8 was sick.   And when they told him, saying, The man of God is
           arrived here, the king said to Azael, Take in thy hand an of-
           fering, and go meet the man of God, and inquire of the Lord
         9 by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?            So Azael
           went to meet him, and took with him of all the good things of
           Damascus, forty camels' burden.       And coming, he stood before
           Elisha, and said to him, Thy son, Son Ader king of Syria,
           hath sent me to thee to inquire, saying, Shall I recover of this dis-
        10 ease of mine ?    And Elisha said, Go say, Thou shalt be in vigour
           of life as the Lord hath shewn me, when thou by death shalt
        11 die.   Then he stood with his eyes fixed on the countenance
            of Azael, and kept them fixed till he blushed.      And the man of
        12 God wept.     Whereupon Azael said, Why doth my lord weep ?
            To which he replied, Because I know all the evils which thou
            wilt do to the children of Israel.    Their fortresses thou wilt de-
            molish with fire ; their chosen men thou wilt slay with the
            sword.   Thou wilt dash to pieces their infants, and rip up their
        13 women with child.      At this Azael said, Who is thy servant ! a
            dead dog ! that I should do such a thing ?        And Elisha said,
            To me the Lord hath pointed thee out reigning over Syria.
        14 Then he departed from Elisha, and went to his master, who
            said to him, What did Elisha say to thee ?         To which he re-
        15 plied, He said thou shalt be in vigour of life.     And on the next
            day he took a napkin, and having dipped it in water, he spread
            it over his face, so that he died. And Azael reigned in his stead.
    Ch. IX.           IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
    16    In the fifth year of Joram, son of Achab, king* of Israel,
       while Josaphat reigned over Juda, Jorarn son of Josaphat be-
    17 gan to reign as king of Juda.He was thirty two years of age
       when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusa-
    18 lem, and walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house
       of Achab did, for he had for his wife a daughter of Achab.
    19 But though he did evil in the sight of the Lord, yet the Lord
       would not destroy Juda for David his servant's sake ; as he had
    20 promised to give a lamp to him, and his children forever.In
       his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda, and
    21 made a king over themselves. When Joram went up to Sior
       and all his chariots with him, though upon their rising he
       smote Edom, who had surrounded him and the captain of the
    22 chariots, yet the people fled to their habitations, and Edom re-
    23 volted from under the hand of Juda even to this day.At the
       same time Lobna also revolted. Now the rest of the acts of
       Joram and all that he did, behold are they not written in the
    24 book of the journal of the kings of Juda?And when Joram
       slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city
       of David, Ochozias his son reigned in his stead.
    25    In the twelfth year of Joram, son of Achab, king of Israel
    26 Ochozias son of Joram reigned. He was in his twenty second
       year when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jeru-
       salem, and his mother's name was Gotholia, a grand daughter
    27 of Ambri king of Israel.And he walked in the way of Achab
       and did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, like the house
    28 of xVchab. Now he went with Joram son of Achab to battle
       against Azael king of Syria, at Kemmath Galaad, and the Sy-
    29 rians smote Joram.And when king Joram returned to Jezrael
       to be cured of the wounds with which the Syrians had smitten
       him, when he fought Azael king of Syria; and Ochozias son
       of Joram went down to see Joram son of Achab at Jezrael,
    IX.    because he was sick ; Elisha the prophet called one of the
       sons of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up thy loins and
       take this cruise of oil in thy hand and go to Kemmath Galaad.
     2 And when thou art come there, and shalt see Jehu, son of Jo-
       saphat, son of Namessi, thou shalt go in and cause him to rise
      from among his brethren, and having taken him into an inner
    3 chamber, thou shalt take the cruise of oil and pour it on his
      Ch. IX.            IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
         head, and say, Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee to
          be king over Israel.Then thou shalt open the door and flee,
       4 and shalt not tarry.So the young man, the prophet went to
       5 Eemmath Galaad, and when he came, behold the chiefs of the
         army were seated, and he said, I have a message to thee,
       6 chief. Whereupon Jehu said, To which of us all ?And he said,
         To thee, the chief. And when he arose and went into the
         house, the prophet poured the oil on his head, and said to
         him, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, I have anointed
       7 thee to be king over the people of the Lordâ€”over Israel.And
         thou shalt utterly destroy the house of thy master Achab, from
         before me, and avenge the blood of my servants the prophets,
       8 and the blood of all the servants of the Lord at the hand of
         Jezabel and at the hand of all the house of Achab.And thou
         shalt cut off from the house of Achab every male, both him
       9 who is attended and him who is neglected in Israel.For I will
         make the house of Achab like the house of Jeroboam son of
      10 Nabat, and like the house of Baasa son of Achia.  And the
         dogs shall devour Jezabel in the portion of Jezrael, and there
      11 shall be none to bury her.Then he opened the door and fled.
         And when Jehu went out to the servants of his master, they
         said to him, Is all well ?Why came this mad man to thee?
      12 And he said to them, You know the man, and his idle dis-
         course. And they said, Thou wrongest us.Pray tell us.Then
         Jeru said, Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying.And when
         he said, Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee to be king
      13 over Israel, they who heard hasted, and every one taking his
         garment, they spread them under him on the top of the stairs,
      14 and sounding a trumpet, they said, Jehu is king.Thus Jehu
         son of Josaphat the son of Namessi conspired against Joram.
            Now Joram and all Israel kept garrison at Eemmath Ga-
      15 laad because of Azael king of Syria, but king Joram had re-
         turned to Jezrael to be cured of the wounds which the Syrians
         had given him when he fought Azael king of Syria.Therefore
         Jehu said, If your soul is with me let no deserter escape from
      16 the city to go and tell the news at Jezrael.Then Jehu drew
         out the cavalry and set out on the march and went down to Jez-
         rael because Jo^ain king of Israel was there under cure, on ac-
         count of the wounds from arrows with which the Aramins shot

    Ch.
        him at Kemmath Galaad in the battle with Azael king of Sy-
        ria ; for he was a valiant man and a warrior.And Ochozias the
     17 king of Juda had srone down there to see him.     And when a
        watchman ascended the tower of Jezrael and saw the dust of
        Jehu as he advanced, he said, I see a dust.Upon which Joram
        said, Take a horseman and send to meet them, and let him
     18 say, Is all well; So the horseman went to meet them.     And
        when he said, Thus saith the king, Is all well ? Jehu replied,
        Whatlis it to thee ?  Fall in behind me.  Then the watchman
        proclaimed saying, The messenger went up to them, but re-
     19 turneth not.  Thereupon the king despatched a second horse-
        man; and when he came upto him and said, Thus saith the king,
        Is all well ? Jehu replied, What is it to thee ? Fall in behind me.
     20 And when the watchman proclaimed saying, He went up to
        them but returneth not.  And he who is the leader, leadeth on
     21 like Jehu the Namessite, for it is with great speed ; Joram said,
        Prepare a chariot. And when the chariot was ready Joram king
        of Israel and Ochozias king of Juda went out each in his own
        chariot, to meet Jehu, and met him at the field of Nabuthi the
     22 Jezraelite. And when Joram saw Jehu he said, Is all well ? To
        which Jehu replied, How can it be well, when the fornications
        of Jezabel thy mother and her sorceries are still so many?
     23 Thereupon Joram turned his hand and fled and said to Ocho-
     24 zias, Treason ! Ochozias.  Then Jehu grasping the bow shot
        Joram between the shoulders, and the arrow passed through
     25 his heart and he fell on his knees.Then Jehu said to Badekar
        his principal officer, Throw him into that part of the field of
        Nabuthi the Jezraelite. For I remember that when I and thou
        were riding together after Achab his father, the Lord pro-
     26 nounced this prophecy against him, Have I not seen the blood
        of Nabuthi and the blood of his sons yesterday ? saith the Lord.
        Therefore I will retribute to him in this very plat of ground,
        saith the Lord. Nowtherefore take him up I pray thee and cast
        him into that plat of ground according to the word of the Lord.
     27 And when Ochozias king of Juda saw this he fled by the way
        of Baithgan and Jehu pursued after him, for he said, And him
        also ; and smote him in his chariot, as he was going down to
        Gai which is Jeblaam.  But he fled to Mageddo and died there.
     28 And his servants took him up in his chariot and brought him
                                                                                                                                           ;

                   to Jerusalem and they buried him in his own sepulchre in the
            29 city of David, he having begun to reign over Juda in the ele-
                   venth year of Joram king of Israel.
            30           Now when Jehu came to Jezrael and Jezabel heard, she
                   painted her eyes and dressed her head and looked out at a win-
            31 dow.            And as Jehu was entering the city the said, Was it well
            32 with Zambri who murdered his master ?                                             Whereupon he looked
                   up to the window, and when he saw her he said, Who art thou ?
                   Come down to me.                        Then two chamberlains looked out at him
            33 and he said, Throw her down.                                       So they threw her down and
                   some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses
            34 for they trampled upon her.                                     And when he had gone in and
                  had eaten and drunk he said, Look, I pray you, for that cursed
            35 woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.                                                          But when
                  they went out to bury her and found nothing of her but only
                  the scull and the feet and the palms of the hands, they returned
            36 and told him, whereupon he said, This is the word of the Lord
                  which he spoke by the ministry of Elias the Thesbite, In the
            37 field of Jezrael the dogs shall devour the flesh of Jezabel ; and
                  the carcase of Jezabel shall be like dung on the ground in the
                  field of Jezrael, that they may not say, Here lieth Jezabel.
            X.              Now Achab had seventy sons in Samaria, therefore Jehu
                  wrote a letter and sent it to Samaria to the chiefs of Samaria
                  and to the elders and to them who had the charge of bringing
              2 up Achab's sons, saying, Soon as this letter shall reach you, as
                  you have with you your master's sons and there are with you
              3 chariots and horses and strong cities and arms, look out the
                  best and fittest of your master's sons and set him on the throne
              4 of his father and fight for the house of your master.                                                            Upon
                  which they were greatly terrified and said, Behold the two kings
              5 were not able to stand before him, and how can we ?                                                      Therefore
                  the officers of the household and the chiefs of the city and the
                  elders and they who had the charge of bringing up the chil-
                  dren sent to Jehu saying, We are thy servants and will do
                  whatever thou shalt order us.                                   We will not make any man
              6 king.           Wewill do what is good in thy eyes.                                          Thereupon Jehu
                  wrote them a second letter saying, If you are for me and
                  will hearken to my voice, take the heads of the menâ€”the
                  sons of your lord and bring them to me about this time to-

       morrow to Jezrael.    Now the king's sons were seventy men
     7 and the nobles of that city brought them up.      So when this
       letter  reached them, they took the king's sons and slew
       them, the seventy men, and put their heads in baskets, and
     8 sent them to him at Jezrael.   And when a messenger came and
       told him saying, They have brought the heads of the king's
       sons; he said, Pile them up in two heaps at the gate of the
     9 city till the morning.  And in the morning he went out, and
       standing up, said to all the people, Ye righteous men ! behold
       I conspired against my master and slew him ; but who hath
    10 slain all these?  You see now that there shall not fall to the
       ground any part of the word of the Lord which he spake
       against the house of Achab.     For the lord hath executed all
    11 that he spoke by the ministry of his servant Elias.  Then Jehu
        slew all that were left of the house of Achab in Jezrael, and
       all his nobles and his acquaintance, and his priests, so that there
    12 was not a remnant of him left.    Then he arose and set out on
    13 his march to Samaria; and coming to the shepherd's pit on
        the way, he met the brothers of Ochozias king of Juda, and
       said, Who are ye ?   And when they said, We are the brothers
       of Ochozias and are come down to salute the children of the
        king and the children of the queen, he said, Take them alive.
    14 So they slew them at that pit.    Of forty two men he did not
    15 leave a man of them.     And going thence he met Jonadab son
        of Kechab, coming to meet him.      And when he had saluted
        him, Jehu said to him, Is thy heart right with my heart, as my
       heart is with thine ? And when Jonadab said, It is : Jehu said
        to him.  Give me thy hand.    So he gave him his hand.    Then
        he caused him to come up to him into the chariot, and said,
    16 Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord.        So he caused
    17 him to take a seat in the chariot.     And when he arrived at
        Samaria, he slew all that were left of Achab in Samaria until
        he had utterly destroyed him, according to the word of the
        Lord which he spoke to Elias.
    18      Then Jehu assembled all the people and said to them,
    19 Achab served Baal a little, Jehu will serve him much.       Now
        therefore all ye, the prophets of Baal, call before me all his
        servants and his priests.  Let not a man be wanting ; for I
        have a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever is missing shall not

       Ch.
           live. This Jehu did in subtilty, that he might destroy all the
       20 servants of Baal.  Then Jehu said, Hallow a solemnity for Baal.
           And when they had proclaimed it, Jehu sent to all Israel, say-
       21 ing, Now let all his servants and all his priests and all his pro-
           phets attend.  Let none be missing.    For I am going to make
           a great sacrifice ; whoever is missing shall not live.So all the
           servants of Baal came, with all his priests and all his prophets.
           There was not a man left who did not attend.    And when they
           came to the house of Baal the house was filled from door to
       23 door.   Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, Bring out vest-
           ments for all the servants of Baal.   And when the keeper of
           the wardrobe had brought them out, Jehu went with Jonadab
           son of Rechab into the house of Baal, and said to the servants
           of Baal, Search and see whether there be with you any of the
           servants of the Lord; for there must, be none but only the ser-
       24 vants of Baal.    Then he went in to offer incense and whole
           burnt offerings.  Now Jehu had stationed for himself eighty
           men without, and said to them, If any of these men escape
           whom I deliver into your hands, the life of him who letteth
       25 him escape shall answer for his life.   So when he had finished
           offering the whole burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and
           to the officers, Go in and smite them ; let not a man of them
       26 get out.   So the guards and the officers smote them with the
           edge of the sword ; and having thrown them out, they went
           to the city of the house of Baal, and brought out the pillar of
       27 Baal and burned it.     And having pulled down the pillars of
       28 Baal they made it a jakes even to this day.       Thus Jehu de-
       29 stroyed Baal out of Israel.  But he did not refrain from follow-
           ing the sins of Jeroboam son of Nabat, who had caused Israel
           to sin.  The golden calves continued in Baithel and in Dan.
       30 Though the Lord said to Jehu, Because thou hast taken a plea-
           sure in doing what is right in my sight, and hast done to the
           house of Achab according to all that was in my heart, thy
           children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Isra-
       31 el ; yet Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the Lord
           God of Israel with his whole heart.    He did not refrain from
           following the sins of Jeroboam who had caused Israel to sin.
        32    In those days the Lord began to lop Israel ; and Azael
        33 smote them all along the border of Israel, from the Jordan
    Ch. XI.           IY. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
       towards the rising of the sunâ€”all the land of Galaad belong-
       ing to the Gadites and the Reubenites and the Manassites from
       Aroer, which is on the bank of the brook Arnon, including
    34 Galaad and Basan.  Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all
       that he did and all his power, and the connexions which he
       formed, are they not written in the journal of the kings of Is-
    35 rael ? When Jehu slept with his fathers, they buried him in
    36 Samaria, and Joachas his son reigned in his stead.The time
       which Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty eight
       years.
    XI.    Now when Gotholia the mother of Ochozias saw that her
     2 son was dead, she destroyed all the royal seed.But Josabee
       king Joram's daughter, the sister of Ochozias, took Joas her
       brother's sonâ€”having stolen him from among the king's sons
       who were slain, both him and his nurse, she hid him in the
       chamber of beds from Gotholia, so that he was not put to
     3 death. And he was with her hidden in the house of the Lord
     4 six years, while Gotholia reigned over the land.But in the
       seventh year Jodae sent for the centurions of the Chorrites and
       the Rasimites, and had them brought to him into the house
       of the Lord, and made a covenant of the Lord with them ; and
       having exacted an oath of them he shewed them the king's
     5 son. Then he gave them a charge saying, This is the thing
       which you shall do. Let one third of you come in on the sab-
     6 bath and keep guard, over the king's house at the gate ; another
       third at the gate of the high way, and the other third at the
     7 gate behind the guards. So you will guard the house. And
       two companies among you even all who go out on the sab-
       bath shall keep guard in the house of the Lord before the
     8 king.  And you shall encompass the king round about, every
       man with his weapon in his hand.And whoever cometh with-
       in the saderoth, let him be put to death. And they shall be with
     9 the king when he goeth out and when he cometh in. Accord-
       ingly the centurions did all that the prudent Jodae commanded
       them.  And they took every man his men, both those who
       came in on duty on the sabbath and those who were to go off
    10 on that day, and went to Jodae the priest.And the priest gave
       the centurions the spears and the shields of king David, which
    11 were in the house of the Lord. And the guards stood every
       Ch. XII.           IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
          man with his weapon in his hand, from the right corner of the
          house to the corner of the house which is on the left of the al-
       12 tar, and of the house near the king round about.  Then he sent
          for the king's son and put upon him the nezer and the
          testimony, and announcing him king, anointed him.        Upon
          which they clapped with the hand, and said, Long live the
       13 king.  When Gotholia heard the noise of the people's guards,
          she came to the people into the house of the Lord and looked.
       14 And behold the king was standing on the pillar as the manner
          was, and the musicians and the trumpeters were before the
          king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and the
          trumpets sounding.   Whereupon Gotholia rent her clothes and
       15 cried with a loud voice, Treason ! Treason !   Then Jodae the
          priest gave orders to the centurions the officers of the army, and
          said to them. Lead her out from within the saderoth and let
       16 one go after her and put her to death with the sword.  Because
          the priest said, Let her not be killed in the house of the Lord,
          therefore they laid hands on her and went out into the street
          leading from the king's house to the horse gate, and she was
       17 slain there.  Then Jodae made a covenant between the Lord
          and the king and the people, that they would be the Lord's
          people.  And he made a covenant also between the king and
       18 the people.  Then all the people of the land went into the house
          of Baal and tore him down and broke all to pieces, his altars
          and his images, and slew Mathan the priest of Baal before the
          altar.  And when the priest had appointed overseers over the
       19 house of the Lord, he took the centurions with the Chorrites
          and the Basimites and all the people of the land and they con-
          ducted the king out of the house of the Lord into the street
          leading from the king's house to the gate of the guard house,
       20 and set him on the throne of the kings.   And all the people of
          the land rejoiced, and the city was at peace after they had slain
          Gotholia at the king's house.
       XII.     Joas was seven years old when he began to reign.      He
          commenced his reign in the seventh year of Jehu and reigned
        2 forty years in Jerusalem.    His mother's name was Sabia of
          Bersabee.   And Joas did what was right in the sight of the
          Lord, all the time Jodae the priest, instructed him. But none
     Ch. XII.            IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
       3 of the high places were removed.     There the people still sa-
         crificed and burned incense on the high places.
       4    Though Joas said to the priests, With regard to all the mo-
         ney arising from things consecrated, the income of the house
         of the Lord, the money of estimation at which every man is
         rated, and all the money which it may come into any man's
       5 heart to bring into the house of the Lord, let the priests take
         for themselves ; but they must bear, every one from what he
         selleth, the expence of the repairs of the house wherever a re-
         pair is found necessary ; yet in the three and twentieth year of
       6 king Joas it was found that the priests had not made the repairs
       7 of the house.    Wherefore Joas the king sent for Jodae the
         priest and the other priests, and said to them, Why have you
         not made the repairs of the house?     Now therefore you must
         not take the money arising from your sales ; for you shall give
      8 it for repairing the house. So the priests agreed not to receive
         any money from the people, on condition that they should
       9 not bear the expence of the repairs of the house.  Then Jodae
         the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it, and
         placed it before the Ammazeibi in the house of the superin-
         tendant of the house of the Lord ; and the priests who kept
         the weights put therein all the money which was found in the
      10 house of the Lord.   And when they saw that there was much
         money in the chest, the king's secretary went with the chief
      11 priest, and tied up and numbered the money found in the
         house of the Lord, and delivered the money when ready into
         the hands of them who did the works, the overseers of the
         house of the Lord ; and they dealt it out to the carpenters and
      12 masons who wrought in the house of the Lord ; and to them
         who built the wall, and to stone cutters, to purchase wood
         and hewn stone sufficient for the repairs of the house ; and to
      13 defray all the expences of the house.  But there were not to be
         made for the house of the Lord silver doors, nails, gob-
         lets, nor any vessels of gold or silver out of the money brought
      14 into the house of the Lord; for they were to give it to them
         who did the work ; and with it they were to keep in repair the
      15 house of the Lord.   Now they did not call the men to account,
         into whose hands they delivered the money to deal it out to the
      16 workmen, for they acted faithfully.   The money for sin offer-
      Ch. XIH.           IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
          ings, and the money for trespass offerings which was brought
          into the house of the Lord, was for the priests.
      17     At that time Azael king of Syria went up and fought
      18 against Geth and took it.  And when Azael set his face to come
         up against Jerusalem, Joas king of Juda, took all the dedi-
         cated things which Josaphat and Joram and Ochozias, his
         forefathers the kings of Juda had dedicated, together with his
         own dedications, and all the gold which was found in the
         treasures of the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and
          sent them to Azael king of Syria, and he went up from Jeru-
      19 salem.  Now all the acts of Joas and all that he did, behold
      20 are they not written in the journal of the king's of Juda ?
             When his servants arose and having formed a conspiracy
         smote Joas at the house of Mello which is in Sela, (Now Jezir-
      21 char son of Jemuath and Jezebuth son of Somer his servants
         smote him) so that he died, he was buried with his fathers in
         the city of David, and Amessias his son reigned in his stead.
      XIII.     In the twenty third year of Joas son of Ochozias king
         of Juda, Joachaz son of Jehu reigned in Samaria, and reigned
       2 seventeen years.   And he did that which was evil in the sight
         of the Lord, and walked after the sins of Jeroboam son of Na-
         bat who had caused Israel to sin, and did not depart from them.
       3 Therefore the Lord was angry with Israel, and delivered them
         into the hand of Azael king of Syria, and into the hands of
       4 Son Ader son of Azael all those days.   But Joachaz intreated
         the favour of the Lord, and the Lord hearkened to him ; for he
       5 saw the affliction of Israel because the king of Syria oppressed
         them, and the Lord gave deliverance to Israel, so that they
         got from under the hand of Syria, and the Israelites dwelt in
       6 their habitations as in former times.Notwithstanding this they
         departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam who had
       7 caused Israel to sin; but walked therein.  And the grove also
         at Samaria still remained, though there had not been left to
         Joachaz any army, but only fifty horsemen, and ten chariots,
         and ten thousand infantry.  For the king of Syria, had destroy-
       8 ed them and made them like dust to be trampled on.       Now
         the rest of the acts of Joachaz, and all that he did and his ex-
         ploits, are they not written in the journal of the kings of Is-
       9 rael ? And Joachaz slept with his fathers, and they buried
         him in Samaria, and Joas his son reigned in his stead.
     Ck. XIII.            IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
     10     In the thirty seventh year of Joas, king of Juda, Joas son
     11 of Joachaz king of Israel reigned over Israel in Samaria.      His
        reign was sixteen years, and he did that which was evil in the
        sight of the Lord.   He did not depart from all the sins of Je-
        roboam, son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin, but
     12 walked therein.    Now the rest of the acts of Joas and all that
        he did and his exploits with Amessias king of Juda, are they
     13 not written in the journal of the kings of Israel?     When Joas
        slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne, he was
        buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
     14     Now when Elisha was sick, with the sickness of which
        he died ; Joas king of Israel went down to him, and wept over
     15 him and said, My father! my father!         The chariot of Israel
        and the horseman thereof!      And Elisha said to him, Take a
        bow and arrows.    And when he had gotten himself a bow and
        arrows, Elisha said to the king, Lay thy hand firm on the bow.
     16 And when Joas had laid his hand firm on the bow, Elisha
        put his hand on the king's hand and said, Open that window
     17 to the east.   And when he had opened it, Elisha said, Shoot.
        And when he had shot Elisha said, The Lord hath an arrow of
        deliveranceâ€”yes, an arrow of deliverance from Syria, and
     18 thou shalt smite Syria at Aphek to destruction.       Then Elisha
        said to him, Take the quiver full of arrows.        And when he
        had taken it, he said to the king of Israel, Smite against the
     19 ground.    And when the king had smitten thrice, he stopt.      At
        which the man of God was grieved and said, Hadst thou smit-
        ten five or six times, then wouldst thou have smitten Syria to
        utter destruction, but now thou shalt smite Syria only thrice.
     20     Now Elisha died, and they buried him.       And the year fol-
        lowing the predatory bands of Moab invaded the land.          xVnd
        it happened that while they were burying a man, behold they
     21 saw the band ; upon which they threw the man into Elisha's
        tomb, and when he sunk down and touched the bones of Eli-
        sha, he revived and stood on his feet.
     22     Now Azael had oppressed Israel all the days of Joachaz, but
        the Lord pitied them and compassionated them, and looked
        upon them, because of his covenant with Abraham and Isaak
     23 and Jacob : and the Lord would not utterly destroy them
           XIV.           IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
       Ch.
       24 nor did he cast them out of his sight.   So when Azael king
          of Syria was dead, and Son Acler his son reigned in his stead,
       25 Joas son of Joachaz returned and took out of the hand of Son
          Ader son of Azael, the cities which, he had taken in war out
          of the hands of Joachaz, his father.  Thrice Joas smote him
          and recovered the cities of Israel.
       XIV.      In the second year of Joas son of Joachaz king of Is-
        2 rael, Amessias son of Joas king of Juda, began his reign. He
          was twenty five years old, when he began to reign, and he
          reigned twenty nine years in Jerusalem, and his mother's
        3 name was Joadim of Jerusalem.     And he did that which was
          right in the sight of the Lord, but not like his father David.
        4 According to all that his father Joas had done, he did.  But
          he did not remove the high places.  Still the people sacrificed
        5 and burned incense on the high places.   And when the king-
          dom was confirmed in his hand, he smote his servants who
          had slain his father. But the children of the murderers he did
          not put to death.   As it is written in the book of the laws of
        6 Mosesâ€”as the Lord commanded saying, Fathers shall not
          be put to death for children; nor shall children be put to
        7 death for fathers ; for every one shall die for his own sins.
              He smote of Edom in Gemeled ten thousand and took
          Petra by war and called its name Jethoel which it now hath.
        8 Then Amessias sent messengers to Joas son of Joachaz son
          of Jehu king of Israel saying, Come, let us look one another
        9 in the face. Whereupon Joas king of Israel, sent to Amessias
          king of Juda, saying, The thistle which is on Libanus sent to
          the cedar on Libanus saying, Give thy daughter to my son
          to wife ; but the wild beasts of the field in traversing Liba-
       10 nus trampled down the thistle.    Thou hast smitten Idumea,
          and thy heart is elated. Enjoy thy glory at home.  Why seek-
          est thou a quarrel to thy hurt, that thou shouldst fall and Juda
       11 with thee?   But Amessias would not hearken.   Therefore Joas
          king of Israel went up.   And he and Amessias king of Juda
       12 met each other at Baithsamus in Juda.     And Juda gave way
       13 before Israel and fled every man to his tent.  And Joas king
          of Israel took Amessias son of Joas son of Ochozias at Baith-
          samus, and came to Jerusalem, and demolished of the wall of
          Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim, to the gate of the corner,

                     with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of
                     Israel, and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
            17                Amessias son of Joas king of Juda, lived after the death of
            18 Joas son of Joachaz king of Israel, fifteen years.                                                                                            Xow the rest
                    of the acts of Amessias and all that he did, are they not writ-
            19 ten in the journal of the kings of Juda?                                                                                     A conspiracy being
                     formed against him in Jerusalem he fled to Lachis, but they
            20 sent after him to Lachis and there put him to death.                                                                                                      But they
                     brought him on horses and he was buried in Jerusalem with
            21 his fathers in the city of David.                                                                    Afterwards all the people of
                     Juda took Azarias when he was sixteen years old and made
            22 him king in the room of his father Amessias.                                                                                                        He rebuilt
                     Aiioth and recovered it for Juda after the king slept with his
                     fathers.
            23                 In the fifteenth year of Amessias son of .Joas king of Juda
                     Jeroboam son of Joas reigned over Israel in Samaria.                                                                                                              His
             24 reign was forty one years.                                                           And he did evil in sight of the
                      Lord.               He departed not from the sins of Jeroboam son of Xa-
            25 bat who had caused Israel to sin.                                                                        He extended the border of
                     Israel from the bay of Aimath to the sea of Araba, according
                     to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which he spoke by the
                     ministry of his servant Jonas son of Amathi the prophet of
            26 Gethchopher.                                     For the Lord saw that the affliction of Israel was
                     very bitter, that they were few in number, closely confined,
                     reduced to penury and forsaken ; and that there was no helper
            27 for Israel ; And the Lord had said that he would not blot out
                     the seed of Israel from under heaven.                                                                                 Therefore he saved
            28 them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Joas.                                                                                             Xow the rest of
                      the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did, and his exploits, how
                      he warred, and how he recovered Damascus and Aimath which
                      belonged to -Juda, for Israel ; are they not written in the journal
             29 of the kings of Israel ?                                                 And Jeroboam slept with his fathersâ€”

         with the kings of Israel, 'and Zacharias his son reigned in his
          stead.
      XV.      In the twenty seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel,
       2 Azarias son of Amessias king of Juda began to reign.   He was
          sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty
         two years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was Jechelia
       3 of Jerusalem.  He did that which was right in the sight of the
       4 Lord, according to all that his father Amessias had done. But
         the high places he did not remove.   Still the people sacrificed
       5 and burned incense on the high places.      Though the Lord
         struck the king with a leprosy and he was leprous to the day
          of his death, yet he reigned in the house, Apphusoth ; and Jo-
         atham the king's son was over the household and judged the
       6 people of the land. Now the rest of the acts of Azarias and all
         that he did, are they not written in the journal of the kings of
       7 Juda?    And when Azarias slept with his fathers, they buried
         him with his fathers in the city of David, and Joatham his son
         reigned in his stead.
       8     In the thirty eighth year of Azarias king of Juda, Zacharias
         son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in Samaria.    His
       9 reign was six months.  And he did evil in the sight of the Lord
         as his father had done. He departed not from all the sins of Je-
      10 roboam son of Xabat who caused Israel to sin.     And Sellum
         son of Jabis conspired against him, and when they had smitten
         him at Keblaam and put him to death, he reigned in his stead.
      11 Now the rest of the acts of Zacharias, behold they are written
      12 in the journal of the kings of Israel.This was the word of the
          Lord which he spake to Jehu saying, Thy sons in the fourth
          generation shall sit on the throne of Israel ; and so it came to
          pass.
      13     Sellum son of Jabis began to reign in the thirty ninth year
      14 of Azarias king of Juda ; and when he had reigned one month
         in Samaria, Manaem son of Gaddi went up from Tharsila and
          came to Samaria and smote Sellum son of Jabis in Samaria and
      15 put him to death.   Now the rest of the acts of Sellum and his
         conspiracy, behold they are written in the journal of the kings
      16 of Israel. Then Manaem smote Thersa and all in it, and the
         suburbs adjoining Thersa.   Because they opened not to him,
         therefore he smote it and ripped up the women with child.

      17     In the thirty ninth year of Azarias king of Juda, Manaem
          son of Gaddi be^an to rei^n over Israel in Samaria.        His reign
      18 was ten years.    And he did evil in the sight of the Lord.        He
          departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam son of Nabat, who
      19 had caused Israel to sin.    In his days Phim king of the Assyri-
          ans, came up against the land.        And Manaem gave Phua a
      20 thousand talents of silver that he might aid him.        This money
          Manaem levied on Israel, fifty shekels a piece upon every
          mighty man, to be given to the king of the Assyrians.         So the
          king of the Assyrians returned and made no establishment in
      2L the land.   Now the rest of the acts of Manaem and all that he
         did, behold are they not written in the journal of the kings of
      22 Israel ?   And when Manaem slept with his fathers his son Pka-
          kesias reigned in his stead.
      23     In the fiftieth year of Azarias king of Juda, Phakesias son
          of Manaem began to reign over Israel in Samaria.           His reign
      24 was two years.     And he did evil in the sight of the Lord.       He
          departed not from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nabat, who
      25 caused Israel to sin.     And Phakee son of Eonielias, his chief
          captain, conspired against him.      And being assisted by Argob
          and Aria and having with him fifty men of the guard of four
          hundred, he slew him at Samaria before the palace.        And when
      2(j he had slain him he reigned in his stead.       Now the rest of the
          acts of Phakesias and all that he did, behold they are written in
          the journal of the kings of Israel.
      21      In the fifty second year of Azarias king of Juda, Phakee
          son of Eomelias began to reign over Israel in Samaria.     His reign
      28 was twenty years.     And he did evil in the sight of the Lord and
          did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam son of Nabat, who
      29 had caused Israel to sin.     In the days of Phakee king of Israel,
          Thalgathphellasar king of the Assyrians came up and took
          Ain and Abel, and Thamacha and Anioch, and Kenez and
          Asor, and Galen and Galileeâ€”all the land of Nephthaleim, and
      30 removed the inhabitants to x^ssyria.         And Osea son of Ela
          formed a conspiracy against Phakee son of Eomelias, and
          smote him, and having put him to death reigned in his stead
      31 in the twentieth year of Joatham son of Azarias.         Now the rest
          of the acts of Phakee and all that he did, behold they are writ-
          ten in the journal ofthe kings of Israel.
       Ch XVI.             IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
       32     In the second year of Phakee son of Komelias, king of Is-
           rael, Joatham son of Azarias, king of Juda, began to reign.
       33 He was twenty five years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was
       34 Jerusa, a daughter of Sadok.   And he did what was right in the
           sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Azarias had
       3o done.   But the high places he did not remove.  Still the people
           sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. He built the
       36 upper gate of the house of the Lord.   Now the rest of the acts
           of Joatham and all that he did, are they not written in the jour-
       37 nal of the kings of Juda?     In these days the Lord began to
           send against Juda Kaasson king of Syria, and Phakee son of
       38 Eomelias.   When Joatham slept with his fathers he was buried
           with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Achaz his
           son reigned in his stead.
       XVI.      In the seventeenth year of Phakee, son of Komelias,
        2 Achaz son of Joatham king of Juda, began to reign.        Achaz
           was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
           sixteen years in Jerusalem, but he did not do what was right
           in the sight of the Lord his God with fidelity like David his fa-
        3 ther.  He indeed walked in the ways of the kings of Israel.  He
           even made his son pass through fire according to the abomi-
           nable acts of the nations which the Lord had removed from
        4 before the Israelites.  He sacrificed also and burned incense
           on the high places, and on the mounts and under every shady
        5 tree.  Then came up Kaasson, king of Syria, and Phakee son
           of Komelias king of Israel, against Jerusalem for war, and be-
        6 sieved Achaz but could not brin^ him to battle.    At that time
           Kaasson, king of Syria, recovered Ailath for Syria; and when
           he had driven the Jews out of Ailath the Idumeans went to
        7 Ailath, and have dwelt there to this day.     Then Achaz sent
           messengers  to   Thalgathphellasar,  king  of  the   Assyrians,
           saying, I am thy servant and thy son.      Come up : Save me
           out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand
        8 of the king of Israel, who are risen up against me. And Achaz
           took the silver and the gold which was found in the treasures
           of the house of the Lord and the king's house, and sent gifts
         9 to the king.  Whereupon the king of the Assyrians hearkened
           to him and came up against Damascus and took it, and having
           1

         Ch.
               removed the inhabitants thereof he put king Kaasson to death.
         10 Then Achaz went up to Damascus to meet Thalgathphella-
               sar king of the Assyrians, at that place.                                            And having taken a
               view of the altar at Damascus, king Achaz sent a model of
               it with its proportions and workmanship to Ourias the priest.
         1     And Ourias the priest built an altar according to all that king
        12 Achaz sent from Damascus.                                      And when the king saw the altar
        13 he went up to it and offered thereon his whole burnt offering,
               and his sacrifice and his libation, and sprinkled the blood of
        14 his peace offering upon that altar.                                      As for the brasen altar which
               was before the Lord he brought it forward towards the front of
               the house of the Lord, from between this altar and the house
        15 of the Lord and put it upon the north side of this altar.                                                                And
               king Achaz commanded Ourias the priest saying, Offer the
               morning and evening whole burnt offering with its sacrifice,
               and the whole burnt offering of the kinÂ£ with his sacrifice, and
               the whole burnt offering of the whole people with their sacri-
               fice and their libation on this great altar, and pour out on it all
               the blood of the whole burnt offering and all the blood of the
               sacrifice.           And the brasen altar shall be for me for the morning.
        16 So Ourias the priest did according to all that king Achaz com-
        17 manded him.                      And king Achaz cut off the embossments of the
               mechonoths and took away from them the lavers, and took
               down the brasen sea from the oxen of brass that were under
        18 it, and set it on a base of stone.                                      He built also the foundation
               of the seat in the house of the Lord, and altered the way of the
               king's coming into the house of the Lord on account of the
        19 king of the Assyrians.                              Now the rest of the acts of Achaz and
               all that he did, are they not written in the journal of the kings
        20 of Juda ?                 And when Achaz slept with his fathers he was buried
               in the city of David, and Ezekias his son reigned in his stead.
        XVII.                 In the twelfth year of Achaz king of Juda, Osea son of
               Ela, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned nine
           2 years.           And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not like
           .'5 the kings of Israel who were before him.                                            Against him Salma-
               nassar king of the Assyrians came up.                                                 Now Osea was his
           1 vassal and had withheld from him the customary homage gift,
               and the king of the Assyrians had found infidelity in Osea;
               for lie had sent messengers to Segor king of Egypt, and had
                                                                      â€”;;
        Oh. XVII.          IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
           not carried to the'king of the Assyrians the customary homage
           gift that year. Therefore the king of the Assyrians besieged
         5 him and bound him in prison.   When the king of Assyria had
           come up through all the land he went to Samaria and besieged
         6 it three years. In the ninth year of Osea, the king of Assyria
           took Samaria and transplanted Israel among the Assyrians, and
           caused them to dwell on the Alae and the Abor, rivers of Gosan,
           and on the mountains of the Medes.
         7     Now this came to pass, because the Israelites had sinned
           against the Lord their God, who brought them up out of the
           land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharao king of Egypt
         8 and had feared other gods, and walked in the ordinances of
           the nations which the Lord had removed from before the Is-
         9 raelites. Indeed with regard to the acts which the kings of Is-
           rael did and which the Israelites adopted ; were they not in
           direct opposition to the Lord their God ?They built for them-
           selves high places in all their cities, from the watch tower to
        10 the fortified city ;and erected for themselves pillars and bow-
        11 ers on every high hill, and under every shady tree; and there
        12 burned incense in all the high places, as the nations did which the
            Lord had removed from before them.    Nay, they unhallowed
           and marked themselves to provoke the Lord to wrath ; and serv-
            ed the idols, concerning which the Lord said to them, You shall
        13 not do such a thing for the Lord.  And though the Lord testi-
            fied to Israel and to Juda by the ministry of all his prophets
            of every seer, saying, Turn from your evil ways and keep my
            commandments and my statutes and all my law which I en-
           joined on your fathers, and which I sent them by the ministry
        14 of my servants the prophets ; yet they hearkened not ; but
        15 hardened their neck more than their fathers had doneâ€”His
            testimonies which he gave them in charge, they did not keep
            but walked after vanities and became vain, and followed the
            nations around them in the very things which the Lord com-
         16 manded them not to do.   They forsook the commandments of
            the Lord their God, and made for themselves a molten image
            â€”even two calves.   And having made bowers, they worship-
         17 ped the whole host of heaven, and served Baal.   They made
            their sons and their daughters to pass through fire, and used
            divination and practised augury. Indeed they sold themselves
    Oh. XVII.            IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
        to do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to wrath.
    18 And though the Lord was very angry with Israel, and re-
        moved them from his presence, and there was none left but
    19 only the tribe of Juda, yet even then Judadid not keep the com-
        mandments of the Lord their God ; but walked in the ordinances
    20 which Israel had made, and rejected the Lord.        Therefore the
        Lord was angry with the whole race of Israel and shook them
        off, and delivered them into the hands of spoilers who ran-
        sacked them until he cast them out of his sight.
    21     Because Israel, besides revoltiug from the house of David,
       made Jeroboam son of Nabat king ; therefore Jeroboam drove
       Israel from following the Lord, and caused them to commit a
    22 great sin ; and the Israelites proceeded on in the sin of Jerobo-
       am which he had caused them to commit ; and departed not
    23 from it, until the Lord removed them from his presence, as he
       spoke by the ministry of all his servants the prophets.
           Now when Israel was removed from their own land to As-
    21 syria, where they continue to this day ; the king of the Assy-
       rians brought people from Babylon and from Chutha and from
       Aia and from Aimath and Seppharuim, and planted them in
       the cities of Samaria, in stead of the children of Israel.    And
       they took possession of Samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof.
    25 But as they did not, at the beginning of their settlement, fear
       the Lord ;   therefore the Lord sent lions among them.        And
       when they were making havock among them, some spoke to
    26 the king of Assyria saying, The nations which thou hast
       removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the
       ritual of the God of that land ; therefore he hath sent lions
       among them, and behold they are killing them, because they
   27 do not know the ritual of the God of that land.     Thereupon the
       king of Assyria gave orders, saying, Take some who came
       from that country, and let them go and dwell there, that they
   28 may teach them the rites of the God of that land.          So they
       brought one of the priests whom they had transported from
       Samaria, and he settled at Baithel.   And while he was instruct-
       ing them how they should fear the Lord, they were making,
   29 every nation, their own gods, which they set up in the house
       of the high places which the Samaritans had erectedâ€”every
   30 nation in the cities where they dwelt.     Thus the men of Baby-
         Ch. XVIII.            IT. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
             Ion made Sokchoth-benith ; and the men of Chuth made Er-
             gal ; and the men of Aimath made Asimath ; and the Evites
         31 made Eblazer and Tharthak; and the Seppharuims made
             Adramelech and Anemelech, because they of Seppharuim
         32 burned their children to these gods.       Though they feared the
             Lord, yet they set up their own abominations, in the houses of
             the high places which they had made in Samaria, every nation
         33 in the city where they dwelt.       Though they feared the Lord,
             yet they made for themselves priests of the high places, and
             sacrificed for themselves in the house of the high places.     They
             both feared the Lord and served their own gods, according to
            the ritual of the nations from which they had been transplant-
         3-4 ed.  Even to this day they have acted according to this ritual
            of theirs.   They fear ; and they do according to their own rites
            and their own institutions, and according to the law and the
            command which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob
         35 to whom he gave the name Israel, Though the Lord had made
            a covenant with them and commanded them, saying, You shall
         36 not fear other gods nor worship them nor serve them, nor
            sacrifice to them, for these acts you must do to the Lord only,
            who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great pow-
            er and with an outstretched armâ€”Him you shall fear, and Him
         37 you shall worship, and to Him you shall offer sacrificeâ€”These
            statutes and these judgments and this law and the command-
            ments which he hath written for you to do, you shall keep con-
         38 tinually; and you shall not fear other godsâ€”and this cove-
         39 nant which he hath made with you, you must not forget.           You
            shall not fear other gods ; but fear the Lord your God only,
         40 and he will deliver you from all your enemies ; and you shall
         41 payno regard to the rites which they practise.     Yet these nations
            feared the Lord and at the same time served their graven
            images.    And even to this day their children and their chil-
            dren's children do as their fathers did.
         XVIII.       Now in the third year of Osea son of Ela king of Israel,
          2 Ezekias son of Achaz kiug of Juda acted as king.             He was
            twenty five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
            twenty nine years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was
          3 Abu, a daughter of Zacharias.      He did that which was right in
            the sight of the Lord, according to all that David his father
        1
      Ch. XVII.                          IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
        4 had done. He removed the high places and broke in pieces the
            pillars and destroyed the bowers and the brasen serpent which
           Moses made.              Because in those days the Israelites were burn-
        5 ing incense to it, therefore he called it Neesthan.                                        He trusted
            in the Lord God of Israel, so that there was not after him one
            like him among the kings of Juda, nor among those who were
        6 before him.             For he cleaved to the Lord and departed not from
            following him, and kept all his commandments which he had
        7 given in charge to Moses.                           And the Lord was with him and
        8 assisted him in all that he did.                         And he revolted from the king
            of Assyria and would not serve him.                              He smote the Philistines
           even to Gaza and the border thereof, from the watch tower to
            the fenced city.
        9        Now in the fourth year of Ezekias which was the seventh
           year of Osea son of Ela king of Israel, Salamanasser king of
           Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it, and took it
      10 at the end of three years.                        In the sixth year of Ezekias, which
      1    was the ninth of Osea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.                                              And
           the king of Assyria removed the Samaritans to Assyria, and
           placed them along the Alae and the Abor, a river of Gozan,
     12 and on the mountains of the Medes, because they had not
           hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, but transgressed
           his covenantâ€”and, with regard to all that Moses the servant
           of the Lord commanded, had neither hearkened to them nor
      13 done them.               And in the fourteenth of king Ezekias, Sennache-
           rim the king of the Assyrians came up against the fortified cities
           of Juda, and when he had taken some of them, Ezekias king
     14 of Juda sent messengers to the king of Assyria at Lachis, say-
           ing, I have done wrong.                     Depart from me.                  Whatever thou im-
           posest on me I will bear.                  Thereupon the king of Assyria imposed
           on Ezekias king of Juda, three hundred talents of silver and thir-
     15 ty talents of gold.                 AndEzekias gave him all the silver which was
           found in the house of the Lord and in the treasury of the king's
     16 house.           At that time Ezekias cut up the doors of the temple,
           and the braces which he, Ezekias king of Juda, had overlaid with
     17 gold, and gave them to the king of Assyria.                                        Nevertheless the
           king of Assyria sent Tharthan and Kaphis, and Rapsakes of La-
           chis, to king Ezekias with a great army against Jerusalem.                                           And
           when they had marched up and arrived at Jerusalem they lialt-

                                                                  â€”

           ed at the conduit of the upper pool, which is by the high way
        18 to the fuller's field, and cried to Ezekias.And there went out
           to hirn Eliakim son of Chelkias, the steward, and Somnas the
        19 secretary, and Joas son of Saphat, the recorder.And Bapsakes
           said to them, Say, I pray you, to Ezekias, Thus saith the king,
        20 the great king of the Assyrians, Of what avail is that confi-
           dence on which thou hast relied?    Thou saidstâ€”but they
        21 were vain wordsâ€”I have counsel and strength for war. Now
           therefore on whom dost thou rely that thou shouldst rebel
           against me ? Perhaps thou leanest on that staffâ€”that broken
           reedâ€”on Egypt ; on which if any one lean, it will enter his
        22 hand and pierce it.Such is Pharao king of Egypt to all who
           trust in him.As to thy telling me, We have relied on the Lord
           God; Is not this he, whose high places and whose altars Eze-
           kias hath pulled down, saying to Juda and Jerusalem, You
        23 shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem ?Though you were
           now in close connexion with my master the king of Assyria,
           and I were to give thee two thousand horses, couldst thou, I
        24 pray thee, mount for thyself riders on them ?How then canst
           thou turn back the face of a petty governorâ€”one of the lowest
           servants of my lord, relying on Egypt for chariots and horse-
        25 men? And now are we come up without the Lord against this
           place to destroy it ?The Lord hath said to me, Go up against
           that land and destroy it.
        26    Then Eliakim son of Chelkias, and Somnas and Joas, said
           to Kapsakes, Speak, we pray thee, to thy servants in Syriac, for
           we understand it.Therefore speak not to us in the Jewish lan-
           guage.  Why shouldst thou speak to the ears of the people on
        27 the wall?  Thereupon Kapsakes said to them, Did my master
           send me to thy master or to thee, to deliver this message ?
           Was it not to those men who are set on that wall that they
        28 may eat their own ordure and drink their own urine ?Then
           Kapsakes stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish lan-
           guage and said, Hear the words of the great king of the Assy-
        29 rians. Thus saith the king, Let not Ezekias deceive you ; for
        30 he cannot deliver you out of his hand.Neither let Ezekias cause
           you to trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will deliver us
           this city shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of
        31 the Assyrians. Hearken not to Ezekias. For thus saith the
                                                                             a
                                           II. KINGS.
     (h. XIX.              IV. KINGSâ€”
         king of the Assyrians, Make peace with me and come out to
         me.   And every one shall drink of his own vine, and every one
         shall eat of his own fig tree, and drink the water of his own cis-
     32 tern; until. I come and take you to a land like your ownâ€”
         land of corn and wine, and bread and vineyardsâ€”a land of olive
        oil and honey, that you may live and not die.        Hearken not to
        Ezekias : for he deceiveth you, saying, The Lord will deliver
     33 us.   Have the gods of the nations delivered their respective
     34 countries out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians ?       Where
        is the God of Aimath and Arphad ? Where the god of Seppha-
        ruaim, Ana and Aba?         Have they delivered Samaria out of
     35 my hand?      Who is there among all the gods of these countries
        who have delivered their countries out of my hand, that the
     3G Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of it?        But they held their
        peace and answered him not a word, For this was the king's
         command, Make hini no answer.
     37     Then came Eliakim son of Chelkias the steward, and Som-
        nas the secretary, and Joas the son of Saphat the recorder to
        Ezekias, with their clothes rent and told him the words of
     XIX.       Ivapsakes.   And when the king Ezekias heard them lie
        rent his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the house
      2 of the Lord.     Then he sent Eliakim the steward, and Somnas
        the secretary, and the elders of the priests clothed with sack-
        cloth to Esaias the prophet the son of Amos, that they should
      3 say to him, Thus saith Ezekias, This is a day of affliction and
        rebuke.    This is indeed a day of fierce indignation ; for children
        are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth.
      4 Perhaps the Lord thy God will attend to all the words of Kap-
        sakes, whom the Assyrian king his master hath sent to reproach
        the living God and blaspheme, in the words which the Lord
        thy God hath heard.       Therefore put up a prayer for the rem-
      5 nant which is left.   And when the servants of the king Ezekias
        came to Esaias he said to them, Thus shall you say to your
      6 master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not terrified at the words
        which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the Assyrian
      7 king have blasphemed.       Behold I will put such a spirit in him
        and he shall hear such news, that he shall return to his own
        land.   And I will destroy him with the sword in his own land.
      8 So Rapsakes returned and found the king warring against Lob-
                    1                                                                                                                                       ;

                    9 na ; for he heard that he had removed from Lachis.                                                                  But when
                         he heard it reported of Tharaka king of the Ethiopians, saying,
                  10 Behold he is come to fight thee, he retreated and sent mes-
                         sengers to Ezekias saying, Let not thy God on whom thou
                        reliest lead thee astray, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered
                  1     into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.                                                       Behold thou hast
                        heard all that the kings of the Assyrians have done to all the
                 12 countries to destroy them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
                        Did the gods of the nations, which my father destroyed, deliver
                        them, namely Gosan and Charran and Eaphis and the children
                 13 of Eden who were at Thaesthin ? Where is the king of Aimath
                        and the king of Arphad? And where is the king of Seppha-
                 14 ruaim, Ana and Aba?                                     And when Ezekias received the letter
                        from the hand of the messengers and had read it, he went up
                15 to the house of the Lord, and spreading it before the Lord said,
                             Lord the God of Israel, who art enthroned on the cherubim,
                KJ Thou alone art God in all the kingdoms of the earth.                                                                            Thou
                       hast made the heaven and the earth.                                              Incline,               Lord, thine ear
                       and hear !              Open,              Lord, thine eyes and see and hear the words
                       of Sennacherim, which he hath sent to reproach the living God.
                17 Of a truth,                       Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste these
                IS nations and committed to the flames their gods.                                                                Because they
                       are not gods, but the works of men's hands, wood and stone
                19 therefore they destroyed them.                                           But now,                 Lord our God, save
                       us out of his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth will know
                20 that thou the Lord alone art God.                                                    Thereupon Esaias son of
                       Amos sent to Ezekias saying, Thus saith the Lord the God of
                       hosts, the God of Israel, I have heard the prayer which thou
                       hast made to me concerning Sennacherim king of Assyria.
                21 This is the word which the Lord hath spoken against him, The
                       virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to
                22 scorn. At thee the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head.
                       Whom hast thou reproached?                                               And whom hast thou blas-
                       phemed ? And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and
                23 lifted up thine eyes ? Against the Holy One of Israel ! By thy
                       messengers thou hast reproached the Lord and said, " With the
                       multitude of my chariots I will ascend the lofty mountainsâ€”the
                       sides of Libanus.                     I have cut down its stately cedars, the choicest
                       cypresses thereof, and entered into the midst of the forest of

     Ch.
     21 Karniel : I have refreshed myself and drunk strange waters, and
        with the soles of my feet dried up all the streams of the siege."
     25 It was I who formed itâ€”I who made it close so that it was ef-
        fectual against strong cities, to carry into captivity captive war-
     26 riors. So the inhabitants therein became weak handedâ€”were
        dismayed and confoundedâ€”became like the grass of the field
        or the green herbâ€”like grass on the house top and that trodden
     27 under foot.  I know indeed thy sitting down and thy going out
     28 and thy wrath against me.  Because thy rage is against me and
        thy haughtiness hath come up to my ears, therefore I will put
        my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips, and turn thee
        back the way thou earnest.
     29    Now this shall be the sign to thee, Eat this year what grow-
        eth spontaneously, and the next year what springeth up ; but
        in the third year there shall be sowing and reaping and plant-
     30 ing of vineyards, and you shall eat the fruit thereof.And the
        remnant of the house of Juda which are left, shall strike root
     31 downwards and bear fruit upwards.   For out of Jerusalem shall
        go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Sion he who hath escaped.
     32 The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.Therefore thus saith
        the Lord respecting the king of Assyria, He shall not come to
        this city ; nor shall he shoot an arrow there.A shield shall not
     33 approach it, nor shall he raise a mount against it.By the way
        he came by the same he shall return ; and to this city he shall
     34 not come, saith the Lord.   For I will shield this city for my
        own sake and for the sake of my servant David.
     35     Accordingly in the night an angel of the Lord went forth
        and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty
        five thousand.  And when they rose early in the morning, be-
     36 hold all these were dead corpses.     Thereupon Sennacherim
        king of the Assyrians struck his tent and began his march and
     37 returned and dwelt in Nineve.   And as he was worshipping in
        the house of Meserach his god, Adramelech and Sarasar his
        sons slew him with the sword ; and as they escaped to the land
        of Ararath, Asardan his son reigned in his stead.
     XX.      In those days Ezekias was sick unto death, and Esaias
        son of Amos the prophet went to him and said to him, Thus
      2 saith the Lord, Give a charge to thy household.   Thou art at
      3 the point of death and shalt nut live.Upon this Ezekias turned
                                                                                                                              ;

                  his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord saying,                                                Lord,
                  remember I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in
                  truth and with a perfect heart, and have done what is good in thy
              4 sight.         And Ezekias wept sore.                        Now Esaias was in the mid-
              5 die court, and a word of the Lord came to him saying, Return
                  and say to Ezekias the leader of my people, Thus saith the
                  Lord the God of thy father David, I have heard thy prayer.
              G I have seen thy tears.                     Behold I will heal thee.                      On the third
                  day thou shalt go up to the house of the Lord.                                            And I will
                  add to thy days, fifteen years, and deliver thee and this city
                  out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend
                  this city, for my own sake, and for the sake of my servant
                  David.
              7         And when he said, Let them take a fig cake and lay it
              8 on the boil, and he will recover, Ezekias said to Esaias, What
                 is the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up
              9 to the house of the Lord on the third day ?                                        To which Esaias
                  replied, This is the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will
                  perform the word which he hath spoken, The shadow shall
            10 advance ten steps, or go back ten steps.                                         And Ezekias said,
                  It is an easy matter for the shadow to decline ten steps.                                              No.
                  Let the shadow return upon the steps, ten steps backwards.
            11 Then Esaias the prophet cried to the Lord, and the shadow-
                 returned on the steps, ten steps backward.
            ^'2        On that occasion Marodoch Baladan son of Baladan king
                 of Babylon, sent a letter and presents to Ezekias, because he
            13 heard that Ezekias had been sick.                                     At this Ezekias was re-
                 joiced, and shewed the messengers all the house of Nechotha
                 the silver and the gold, the spices and the precious oil, and
                 the house of the vessels, and all that was in his treasuries.
                 There was not a thing in his house, or within his power which
            14 he did not shew them.                          Whereupon Esaias the prophet went
                 to king Ezekias, and said to him, What have these men said,
                 and whence are they come to thee ?                                     To which Ezekias re-
                 plied, They are come to me from a far distant countryâ€”from
            15 Babylon.             Then he said, What have they seen in thy house?
                 And he said, They have seen all that are in my house.                                               There
                 is not a thing in my house, or in my treasuries which I have
            16 not shewn them.                     Then Esaias said to Ezekias, Hear a word
     Ch. XXL             IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
     17 of the Lord.   Behold the days are corning, when all that are in
        thy house, and all that thy fathers have been treasuring up
     18 even to this day, shall be carried to Babylon.   Not a word shall
         fail which the Lord hath spoken.      And as for thy sons who
         shall spring from thee, whom thou shalt beget, he will take
        them and they shall be eunuchs in the house of the king of
     19 Babylon.    And Ezekias said to Esaias, Good is that word
         which the Lord spokeâ€”There shall be peace in my days.
     20      Now the rest of the acts of Ezekias and all his power and
         all that he did, the pool and the aqueduct to bring water into
         the city, are they not written in the book of the journal of the
         kings of Juda?     And Ezekias slept with his fathers, and
         Manasses his son reigned in his stead.
     XXI.      Manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign,
         and he reigned fifty five years in Jerusalem ; and his mother's
      2 name was Apsiba.     And he did evil in the sight of the Lord,
         according to all the abominable acts of the nations which the
      3 Lord had removed from before Israel.         He restored and re-
         built the high places which his father Ezekias had demolish-
         ed ; and erected an altar to Baal ; and made bowers as Achab
         king of Israel had done ; and worshipped the whole host of
       4 heaven and served them.     He even built an altar in the house
       5 of the Lord.   Though the Lord had said, In Jerusalem I will
         put my name ; yet he built an altar to the whole host of heaven,
      6 in the two courts of the house of the Lord ; and made his
         sons pass through fire, and consulted omens, and auguries, and
         built temples, and multiplied diviners, to do evil in the sight
       7 of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.        Nay, he placed the
         graven image of the bower in the very house, concerniDg
         which the Lord had said to David and to Solomon his son,
         In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of
       8 all the tribes of Israel, I will place my name forever, and I
         will no more remove the foot of Israel, from the land which I
         gave their fathers, provided they will keep all that I have com-
         manded, according to the command which my servant Moses
       9 commanded them.       Now when they kearkened not, and Ma-
         nasses led them astray to do evil in the sight of the Lord,
         more than those nations, which the Lord had destroyed from
                          IV.
      Ch. XXI.               KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
      10 before the Israelites ; then by the ministry of his servants the
      11 prophets, the Lord spoke saying, Because Manasses the king
         of Juda hath committed all these abominationsâ€”these evils sur-
         passing all that the Amorites did before him, and hath caused
      12 Juda also to sin by their idols ; therefore thus saith the Lord
         the God of Israel, Behold I will bring evils upon Jerusalem
         and Juda, so that both the ears of every one who heareth them
      13 shall tingle.And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Sa-
         maria, and the plummet of the house of Achab ; and wipe Je-
         rusalem as a vessel of alabaster is wiped and turned on its
      14 mouth.  And I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance, and
         deliver them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall
      15 be for a spoil, and for a prey to all their enemies, because they
         have done evil in my sight and gone on provoking me from
         the day I brought them out of Egypt, even to this day.
      16    Moreover Manasses shed innocent blood in great abun-
         dance till he rilled Jerusalem, from one end to the other, in
         addition to the sins by which he caused Juda to sin, by doing
      17 evil in the sight of the Lord.Now the rest of the acts of Ma-
         nasses and all that he did, and the sins which he committed
         are they not written in the journal of the kings of Juda?
      18 When Manasses slept with his fathers, he was buried in the
         garden of his house in the garden of Oza ; and Amos his son
         reigned in his stead.
      19    Amos was twenty two years old, when he began to reign
         and he reigned two years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name
      20 was Mesollam.  She was a daughter of Arus of Jeteba.And
         he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as Manasses his father
      21 had done, and walked in all the way in which his father walked
         and served the idols, which his father served and worshipped
     22 them.  He forsook the Lord God of his fathers and did not
     23 walk in the way of the Lord, therefore Amos' servants con-
     24 spired against him, and slew the king in his own house.But
        the people of the land, smote all those who conspired against
        king Amos.   And the people of the land made his son Josias
     25 king in his stead.Now the rest of the acts of Amos and all
        that he did, behold are they not written in the journal of the
        kings of Juda ?
     26     Now when they had buried him in his sepulchre in the
     Ch. XXII.            IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
     X X II.    garden of Oza, Josias his son reigned in his stead.   Jo-
        sias was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reign-
        ed thirty one years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was
        â€¢Tedia.  She was a daughter of Edria of Basuroth.    He did that
        which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all
        the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right
      3 nor to the left. Accordingly in the eighteenth year of king Jo-
        sias in the eighth month, the king sent Sapphan son of Ezelias,
        son of Mesollam, the scribe of the house of the Lord, saying,
      4 Go up to Chelkias the high priest and seal the money which is
      5 brought into the house of the Lordâ€”which they who keep the
        weights have received from the people, and let it be delivered
        into the hand of the board of works in the house of the Lord.
      6 And when he had given this to the board of works in the house
        of the Lord to defray the expence of the repairs of the house
        â€”for the carpenters and the masons, and them who built the
        walls, and to purchase wood and hewn stone to repair the
      7 breaches of the house ; (now they to whom the money was
        given were not to be called to account, for they acted in confi-
      8 dence) Chelkias the high priest said to Sapphan the scribe, I
        have found a book of the law in the house of the Lord.        So
        Chelkias gave the book to Sapphan ; and when he had read it
        he went to the kinÂ£ in the house of the Lord, and having made
        report to the king, saying, Thy servants have melted the sil-
        ver found in the house of the Lord, and have given it to the
    10 board of works which hath charge of the house ; Sapphan
        the scribe spake to the king, saying, Chelkias the priest hath
    11 given me a book.    x\nd Sapphan read it before the king.    And
        when the king heard the words of the book of the law he rent
    12 his clothes.  Then the king gave orders to Chelkias the priest
        and Achikam son of Sapphan and Achobar son of Michaias,
        and to Sapphan the scribe and Asaias a servant of the king,
    13 saying, Go and inquire of the Lord concerning me and con-
        cerning all this people and concerning all Juda, and concern-
        ing the words of this book which is found.   For great must be
        the wrath of the Lord which is kindled against us ; because our
        fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book to do ac-
     14 cording to all that is written for us. Accordingly Chelkias the
        priest went with Achikam and Achobar and Sapphan and

          Asaias to Olda the prophetess the mother of Sellein son of
          Thekuan, son of Aras the keeper of the wardrobe.  Now she
       15 dwelt at Jerusalem in the Masena.And when they had spoken
          to her, she said to them, Thus saith the Lord the God of Is-
       16 rael, Say to the man who hath sent you to me, Thus saith the
          Lord, Behold I am bringing evils on this place and on the in-
          habitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the
       17 king of Juda hath read.  Because they have forsaken me and
          burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me by
          the works of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled
       18 against this place and shall not be quenched.But to the king
          of Juda who hath sent you to inquire of the Lord, thus shall
       19 you say to him, Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, With
          respect to the words which thou hast heard, because thy heart
          was softened and thou didst humble thyself on the account of
          them soon as thou didst hear what I had spoken against this
          place and the inhabitants thereofthat they should become a
                                         â€”
          desolation and a curse ; and didst rend thy clothes and weep
       20 before me ; for I heard, saith the Lord ; therefore behold I will
          gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy
          grave in peace, and thy eyes shall not see all the evils which I
          will bring on this place.
       XXIII.     When they brought back this answer to the king, the
          king sent and assembled before him all the elders of Juda and
        2 Jerusalem.  And the king went up to the house of the Lord,
          accompanied by all the chiefs of Juda and all the iuhabitants of
          Jerusalem, with the priests and the prophets and all the people
        3 small and great. And when he had read in their hearing all the
          words of the book of the covenant, which was found in the
          house of the Lord, the king stood before the pillar and made a
          covenant in the presence of the Lord to follow the Lordâ€”to
          keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes,
          with all his heart and with all his soulâ€”to conform to the terms
        4 of the covenant, the things written in the book.And all the
          people joined in the covenant. Then the king ordered Chel-
          kias the high priest and the priests of the second order and
          them who had the charge of the weights, to bring out of the
          temple of the Lord all the utensils which were made for Baal
          and for the bower and for all the host of heaven, and he burned
      Ch. XXIII.              IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
          them without Jerusalem at Sademoth Keclron, and sent the
       5 ashes thereof to Baithel.        He burned also the Chomarims,
          whom the kings of Juda had appointed.         These were they who
          burned incense on the high places and in the cities of Juda
          and in the places around Jerusalem.         He burned them also,
         who offered incense to Baal and to the sun and the moon and
       6 the signs in the zodiack and to all the host of heaven.          And
          lie brought out the bower out of the house of the Lord with-
          out Jerusalem to the brook Kedron, and having burned it by
         the brook Kedron, he ground it to powder, and strewed the
       7 powder over the graves of the children of the people.        He pull-
         ed down also the house of Kadesim in the house of the Lord,
       8 where the women wove hangings for the bower.                Then he
         brought up all the priests out of the cities of Juda, and defiled
         the high places where the priests burned incense from Gaibal
         to Bersabee.    He demolished also the house of the gates which
         was at the door of the gate of Jesus, the governor of the city, on
       9 the left of a man entering at the gate of the city.   But the priests
         of the high places did not go up to the altar of the Lord at Je-
         rusalem ;   for they only eat unleavened bread among their
      10 brethren.   He denied also Tapheth which was set apart in the
         valley of the son of Ennom, for a man to cause his son or
      11 his daughter to pass through fire to Moloch.         And he burned
         the houses which the kings of Juda had dedicated to the sun
         at the entrance of the house of the Lord, at the treasury office
      12 of Nathan, the king's chamberlain, at Pharurim.           He burned
         also with fire the chariot of the sun, and the altars which were
         on the roof of Achaz's chamber, which the king's of Juda had
         erected? and he pulled down the altars which Manasses had
         made in the two courts of the house of the Lord, and having
         dragged them out thence piece meal, he threw the rubbish
     13 of them into the brook Kedron.           The king defiled also the
         house which was in front of Jerusalemâ€”that which was on the
         right of mount Mosthath, which Solomon king of Israel had built
         for Astarte, the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chamos,
         the abomination of Moab, and for Moloch the abomination of
      14 the Ammonites.       And when he had broken in pieces the pil-
         lars, and utterly destroyed the bowers, and filled their places
      15 with human bones, he then tore down also the altar which was
       Ch. XXIII.           IV. KINGS-II. KINGS.
           at Baithel, that high altar which was erected by Jeroboam, son
           of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin.   Even that high altar
           he tore down and broke the stones thereof to pieces and pound-
       16 ed them to dust, and burned the bower.       Now when Josias
          turned and saw the graves which were there in the city, he sent
           and took the bones out of the graves and burned them on the
           altar, and polluted it according to the word of the Lord, which
          the man of God spoke when Jeroboam was standing on the al-
          tar at the festival.Then turning he cast his eyes on the tomb
       17 of the man of God who spoke these words, and he said, What
          monument is that which I see ?   And when the men of the city
          said, It is the man of God who came from Juda to denounce,
          and who denounced these very things against this altar at
       18 Baithel ; he said, Let him alone, Let no man move his bones.
          So his bones escaped with the bones of the prophet, who came
       19 from Samaria.   All the houses also of the high places which
          were in the cities of Samariaâ€”which the kings of Israel had
          built to provoke the Lord, Josias removed, and did to them all
       20 that he had done at Baithel.   And when he had sacrificed all
          the priests of the high places who were there over the altars,
          and burned the bones of men upon them, he returned to Jeru-
          salem.
       21    Then the king issued orders to all the people, saying, Ce-
          lebrate the passover to the Lord our God, as it is written in
       22 the book of this covenant.   For from the days of the Judges
          who judged Israel, there had not been during all the days of
       23 the kings of Israel and the kim>s of Juda, such a passover as
          this which was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem in the eighteenth
       24 year of Josias.  For Josias removed all the devotees and the
          diviners and the theraphins and the idols and all the abomina-
          tions which were in the land of Juda and in Jerusalem, that he
          might conform to the words of the law which were written in
          the book which Chelkias the priest had found in the house of
      25 the Lord.   Like him there was no king before him who turned
          to the Lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all
          his strength, according to all the law of Moses ; nor did there
      26 arise after him any one like him.  Nevertheless the Lord turn-
          ed not from the fervency of his great wrath with which he was
          incensed against Juda at the provocations with which Manasses
     Ch. XXIV.           IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
    27 had provoked him.     So the Lord said, I will remove Juda also
        from my presence as 1 have removed Israel ; and I will cast off
        this city of Jerusalem which I chose, and this house of which I
    28 said, My name shall be there.    Now the rest of the acts of Jo-
        sias and all that he did, are they not written in the journal of
    29 the kings of Juda ?   In those days when Pharao Nechao king
        of Egypt was going up against the king of Assyria to the river
       Euphrates, Josias went out to meet him.     And Nechao slew
    30 him at Mageddo when he saw him.      And his servants took him
       up mortally wounded at Mageddo and brought him to Jeru-
       salem, and buried him in his own tomb.      And the people of
       the land took Joachaz son of Josias and anointed him, and
       made him king in his father's stead.
    31     Joachaz was twenty three years old when he began to reign,
       and he reigned three months in Jerusalem, and his mother's
       name was Amital.    She was a daughter of Jeremias of Lobna.
    32 He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord according
    33 to all that his forefathers had done.  So when Pharao Nechao
       was at Rablaam in the land of Emath, he removed him from
       reigning in Jerusalem, and imposed as a fine on the land a
       hundred talents of silver and a hundred talents of gold; and
    34 having made Eliakim son of Josias, king of Juda, king over
       them in the room of his father Josias, Pharao Nechao changed
       his name to Joakim ; and he took Joachaz and carried him to
    35 Egypt, and he died there.  And Joakim gave the silver and the
       gold to Pharao : moreover he assessed the land to give the
       money at the command of Pharao.       Every man of rank ac-
       cording to his assessment gave with the people of the land sil-
       ver and gold to be given to Pharao Nechao.
    36    Joakim was twenty five years old when he began to reign,
       and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem ; and his mother's
       name was Jeldath.    She was a daughter of Phadail of Ruma.
    37 And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that
    XXIV.     his forefathers had done.   In his days Nabuchodono-
       sar king of Babylon came up, and Joakim became his vassal.
     2 Three years.  Then he turned and revolted from him, and the
       Lord sent against him predatory bands of the Chaldeans, and
       predatory bands of Syria, and predatory bands of Moab, and
       the predatory bands of the Ammonites.    These he let loose to
                          IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
       Ch. XXIV.
          prevail in the land of Juda, according to the word of the Lord
        3 which he spoke by the ministry of his prophets.But to add to
          the wrath of the Lord against Juda, that he might remove
          them from his presence, for all the sins which Manasses
          had committed, Joakim shed innocent blood, and filled Je-
        4 rusalem with it.  Therefore the Lord would not be pacified.
        5 Now the rest of the acts of Joakim and all that he did, behold
          are they not written in the book of the journal of the kings of
        6 Juda?   And Joakim slept with his fathers, and Joachim his
        7 son reigned in his stead.And the king of Egypt never came
          any more out of his land ; for the king of Babylon took all
          that belonged to the king of Egypt, from the brook of Egypt
          to the river of Euphrates.
        8     Joachim was eighteen years old when he began to reign,
          and he reigned three months in Jerusalem, and his mother's
          name was Nestha.  She was a daughter of Ellanastham of Je-
         9 rusalem. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according
       10 to all that his father had done.At that time Nebuchodonosar
          king of Babylon, came up to Jerusalem, and the city was be-
       ll sieged.  Now when Nebuchodonosar came to the city, and his
          servants laid siege to it, Joachim king of Juda, went out to
       12 the king of Babylon, he and his servants and his mother and
          his chiefs and his officers ; and the king of Babylon in the
        13 eighth year of his reign, took him, and carried out thence all
          the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the
           king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which
           Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord,
       14 according to the word of the Lord. And he carried away cap-
           tive from Jerusalem all the chiefs and mighty men of valour,
           ten thousand captives, with all the carpenters and mechanics,
        15 so that there were none left but the poor of the land.When he
           carried away Joachim to Babylon, he carried away also out of
           Jerusalem in captivity to Babylon, the king's mother and the
           king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty men of the coun-
        16 try, and all the men of the army, amounting to seven thou-
           sand, and the carpenters and mechanics amounting to a thou-
           sand. All these were valiant men fit for war.These the king of
        17 Babylon carried away captives to Babylon. And the king of
           Babylon made Batthainas king in his stead, and called his
           name Sedekias.
     Ch. XXV.                  IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
              Sedekias was twenty one years old when he began to reign
         and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem ; and his mother's
     19 name was Amital.           She was a daughter of Jeremias.              And he
         did evil in the sight of the Lord according to all that Joachim
     20 had done.        Because the anger of the Lord was against Jerusa-
         lem and Juda until he cast them out from his presence ; there-
         fore    when Sedekias rebelled against the king of Babylon,
     XXV.          Nabuchodonosar the king of Babylon came up with
         his whole army against Jerusalem, in the ninth year of his
         reign, in the tenth month, and encamped against it and built a
         circumvallation against it, and the city was besieged until the
       2 eleventh year of king Sedekias.             On the ninth of that month
       3 when the famine prevailed in the city so that there was not
         bread for the people of the land, a breach was made into the
       4 city : and all the men of the army went out by night by the
          way of the gate between the walls, namely the gate of the
          king's garden, while the Chaldeans besieged the city round
       5 about.     And the king took the way to Araba.              But the army of
         the Chaldeans pursued him and overtook him at Araboth of
       6 Jericho.     When all his army was dispersed from about him,
          they took the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at
       7 Reblatha, and he pronounced sentence against him.                   And when
          he had slain his sons before his eyes, he put out the eyes of Se-
          dekias and bound him with chains, and carried him to Baby-
       8 Ion.    And in the fifth month, on the seventh of the month, in
          the nineteenth year of Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon, Na-
          buzardan the marshal who attended the king of Babylon, came
       \) up to Jerusalem and burned the house of the Lord and the
          king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem.                And while the
     10 marshal was burning all the houses, the army of the Chaldeans
      11 broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.                    Then Nabu-
          zardan the marshal, carried away the residue of the people
          who had been left in the city, and the deserters who had de-
          serted to the king of Babylon, and what remained of the army.
      12 But he left some of the poor of the land for vine dressers and
      13 husbandmen.          The pillars of brass in the house of the Lord
          and the mechonoths, and the brasen sea in the house of the
          Lord,    the Chaldeans broke to pieces and carried the brass
      14 thereof to Babylon.         And the marshal took the kettles and the
       Ch. XXY.           IV. KINGSâ€”II. KINGS.
       15 goblets, and the dishes and the censers, and all the utensils of
          brass with which the priests ministered, together with the fire
       16 pans and the cups of gold and silver.Now with regard to the
          two pillars and the sea, and the mechonoths which Solomon
          made for the house of the Lord, there was no weighing the
       17 brass of all these utensils.The height of one pillar was eigh-
          teen cubits. And there was upon it a chapiter of brass, the
          height of the chapiter being three cubits, with a net work and
       18 pomegranates on the chapiter round about, all of brass.And
          such was the second pillar with its net work.And the marshal
          took Saraias the first priest, and Sophonias the priest of the
       19 second order and the three keepers of the weights; and out
          of the city he took one officer, who was chief commander of the
          warriors, and five principal men of them who attended in the
          king's presence, who were found in the city, and the secretary
          of the general of the armyâ€”him who mustered the people of
          the land ; and sixty chief men of the people of the country
       20 who were found in the city.  These Nabuzardan the marshal
          took and carried them to the king of Babylon to Reblatha, and
       21 the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death at
          Eeblatha in the land of Aimath.
       22    Thus was Juda carried from this land.And as for the peo-
          ple who were left in the land of Judaâ€”whom Nabuchodonosar
          king of Babylon had left; over them he set Godolias son of
       23 Achikam son of Sapphon.  And when all the chiefs of the army,
          they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had ap-
          pointed Godolias, they came to him at Massephath, namely,
          Ismael son of Nathanias, and Jona son of Kareth, and Saraias
          son of Thanamath, the Netophathite, and Jezonias son of Macha-
       24 thi, they and their men.And Godolias swore to them and their
          men, and said to them, Be not afraid of the coming of the Chal-
          deans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it
       25 will be well with you.Nevertheless in the seventh month Is-
          mael son of Nathanias, son of Elisama of the royal family,
          came accompanied with ten chiefs, and smote Godolias and
          killed him and the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him
       26 at Massepha.  Whereupon all the people small and great, with
          the chiefs of the army arose and went to Egypt ; for they were
          afraid of the Chaldeans.

  27        In the thirty seventh year of the captivity of Joachim king
       of Juda in the twelfth month and twentieth day of the month,
       Evial Marodek king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign
       raised up the head of Joachim king of Juda.                      And having taken
  28 him out of prison he spoke kindly to him, and set his seat
       above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
  29 And having changed his prison garments he eat bread conti-
       nually before him all the days of his life.                     And his allowance,
       a continual allowance, was duly sent to him every day all the

     24      The sons of Symeon were Xainuel and Jaruin, Jarib, Zares,
         Saul, Salem his son ; Mabasam his son ; 3Iasma his son ; Amu-
     27 el his son ; Zakehur his son ; Semei his son.         Seinei had six-
         teen sons and six daughters ; but their brethren had not many
         children ; nor did all their families abound like the children of
     28 Juda.    Now they dwelt in Bersabee and Molada, and in Eser-
         saul and in Balaa, and in Aisem and in Tholad, and in Bathuel
         and in Erma, and in Sikelag, and in Baithmarimoth and He-
         misuseosin, and the house of Baruseorim.          These were their
     32 cities till the reign of king David.     And the folds for their cat-
         tle were Aitan and En, Bemnon and Thokka, and Aisar, five
         cities with all their folding places around these cities even to
     33 Baal.     This was their possession and this their distribution
     34 into communities, including Mosabab and Jemoloch, and Josia
     35 son of Amassia, and Joel and Jehu, son Asabia, son Saran, son
     36 Asiel ; and Elionai and Jokaba, and Jasuia and Asaia, and Je-
     37 diel and Ismael, and Banaias and Zuza son of Saphai, son of
     38 Alon, son of Jedia, son of Semri, son of Samaias.          These were
         they who having branched out under the names of chiefs in
         their families and in their patriarchal houses, were increased
     39 to a multitude and spread themselves in search of pastures for
     40 their cattle, till they came to Gerara to the east of G-ai, where
         they found pastures, extensive and good, for the land before
     41 them was spacious and there was peace and tranquillity.            Be-
         cause they who dwelt there before them were of the children
         of Cham, therefore those above mentioned came in the days
         of Ezekias king of Juda, and smote their families, even the
         Minaians whom they found there, and utterly destroyed them
         even to this day, and dwelt in their stead, because there were
     42 pastures there for their cattle.    And from among these five hun-
         dred of the Symeonites with Phalaettia and Xoadia, and Ra-
     43 phaia and Oziel sons of Jessi, their chiefs, went to Mount Seir
         and smote the remains of Amelek who had been left even to
         this time.

         was the first born, but when he went up to his lather's bed,
         his father gave his birth right to his son Joseph as the son of
         Israel : yet in the genealogy he did not attain the right of primo-

           brethren to have the Ruler appointed out of him, though the
        3 blessing was Joseph's.     Now the sons of Reuben, the first born
        4 of Israel, were Enoch and Phallus, Asrom and Charrni.            The
           sons of Joel, Semei and Bania, his son.     And the sons of Goug
           son of Semei, Micha his son ; Recha his son ; Joel his son ;
        7 Beel his son, whom Thalgathphallasar, king of Assyria, carried
           away captive.    He was the chief of the Reubenites.        And his
           brethren in his patriarchal family in their classes according to
        8 their genealogies, were the chief Joel and Zacharias, and Balek
           Son Azouz, Son Sama, Son Joel.       Now the Reubenites dwelt at
        9 Aroer, and at Nabau and Beelmasson, and eastward to the
           edge of the wilderness which bordereth on the river Euphrates ;
       10 for they had many cattle in the land of Galaad.          And in the
           days of Saul they made war on their neighbours ; and all those
           who dwelt in tents on the east of Galaad fell by their hands.
       11      The children of Gad dwelt along side of them in the land
       12 of Basan, even to Selaâ€”Joel was the first born and Sapham
       13 the second, and Janin the muster master in Basan.          And their
           brethren according to the houses of their patriarchal families
           were, Michael, Mosollam and Sebe, and Joree and Joachan,
       14 and Zue and Obed, seven.         These were the sons of Abichaia
           son of Ouri, son of Idai, son of Galaad, son of Michael, son of
           Jesai, son of Jeddai, son of Buz, brother's son of Abdiel, son
       15 of Gouni.     He was the chief of the patriarchal house.        They
       16 dwelt in Galaad, in Basan and in their towns, and occupied all
       17 the borders of Saron to the outlet.     Of all these an account was
           taken in the days of Joatham king of Juda, and in the days of
       18 Jeroboam king of Israel.      The Reubenites and the Gadites, and
           the half of the tribe of Manasses who were fit for war, men
           wielding shields and swords and bending the bow and disci-
       19 plined for battle, were forty four thousand seven hundred and
           sixty who marched out in array.       When they were at war with
       20 the Agarenians and the Itureans, and the Naphaisaians and the
           Nadabeans, they prevailed over them.          And the Agarenians
           with all their tents, were delivered into their hands.   For in the
           battle they cried to God and he hearkened to them, because
        21 they trusted in him.    So theytook all their substance, five thou-
           sand camels, two hundred and fifty thousand sheep, two thou-
           sand asses, and a hundred thousand prisoners, and many were

              stead till the captivity.

       24 Libanus they were very numerous.                                                And these were the lead-

              when they revolted from the God of their fathers and went a
              whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God
       26 had removed from before them, the God of Israel stirred up
              the spirit of Phaloch king of Assur, and the spirit of Thagla-
              phalassar king [of Assur, and he removed Reuben and Gad,
              and the half of the tribe of Manasses, and carried them to
              Chaach and Chabor, and to the river of Gozan, where they
              are to this day.

            Now these are they who are enrolled in the book of the
         kings of Israel and Juda, with them who were carried away
         to Babylon, for their iniquities, and who had formerly dwelt in
         their possessions in the cities of Israel, including the priests,
         the Levites and the persons given them, (for in Jerusalem
         there dwelt some of the children of Juda, and some of the
         children of Benjamin, and some of the children of Ephraim,
      4 and Manasses ;) Gnothi son of Samiud, son of Amri, son of

            Jemnai, with their brethren, according to their respective fa-
            milies, nine hundred and fifty six.        All these were heads of
        10 families, according to the houses of their families.           And of
        11 the priests, Jodae and Joarim and Jachin and Azaria son of
            (Jhelkias, son of Mosollam, son of Sadok, son of Maraioth,
            son of Achitob, ruler of the house of God ; and Adaia, son
        12 of Iraam, son of Thaschor, son of Melchia; and Maasia, son
        13 of Acliel, son of Ezira, son of Mosollam, son of Maselinoth,
            son of Emmer, and their brethren, chiefs of houses of their
            families, a thousand seven hundred and sixty, mighty in power
        14 for the work of the service of the house of God.           And of the
            Levites, Samaia son of Asob, son of Ezrikam, son of Asa-

        17 in the villages of Notephati ; the keepers of the gates, Salom,
            Akuro, Telmon and Diman and their brethren, Salom being
        18 at this time, the chief at the king's gate, namely the eastern
        19 gate, of the camp of the Levites ; and Sellum son of Kore,
            son of Abiasaph, son of Kore.      Now his brethren, for the house
            of his father, namely the Korites, were over the works of the
            service keeping the watches of the tabernacle, and their fathers
        20 were over the camp of the Lord guarding the entrance.             And
            Phineas son of Eleazar was the ruler over them, and these
        21 were his assistantsâ€”Zacharias son of Mosolloini, keeper of the
        22 door of the tabernacle of the testimony, all the chosen keepers
            of the gates, were two hundred and twelve.      With respect to the
            distribution of these    in  their respective courts, David and
        23 Samuel the seer appointed them to their office, and they and
            their sons had the charge of the gates in the house of the
        24 Lord, and in the house of the tabernacle, to keep watch.          The
            gates were according to the four winds, east, west, north, and
        25 south.   And their brethren in the villages were to relieve them,
        20 every seven days from time to time.         Because the four chiefs
                                                                                                                        ;

            had the charge of the gates, and the Levites who were over
            the store houses, and over the treasures of the house of God
      27 encamp nearâ€”because the watch rested on them, therefore they
            had the charge of the keys to open every morning, the doors of
      28 the sanctuary.                 Now some of the Levites were over the imple-
            ments of the service, for they were to be brought in and car-
      29 ried out by tale.                     So some were over the implements, and
            over all the holy vessels, and over the fine flour, the wine
      30 and the oil, the frankincense and the spices.                                       And of the sons
            of the priests, some were confectioners and prepared the spices.
      31 And of the Levites, Matthathias, who was the first born of
            Salom the Korite, he had the charge of the works of the sa-
           crifice prepared              in the pan of the high priest, and Banaias
      32 the Kaathite, who was of their brethren, was over the shew
      33 bread, to set it in order every sabbath ; and the singers, the
           chiefs of those families of the Levites, who were distributed
      34 into daily classes ; because the chiefs of these families of the
           Levites were employed in this service day and night, therefore
           they dwelt in Jerusalem.
     35          Now at Gabaon dwelt father Gabaon, Jeel, whose wife's
     36 name was 3Iocha, and his son, the first born, Abdon ; and
     37 Sour and Kis and Baal and Ner and Nadab and Gedour and
           a brother, and Zakchur and Alakeloth : and Makeloth begot
     38 Samaa.             And these among their brethren dwelt at Jerusalem,
     39 among their brethren.                         And Ner begot Kis, and Kis begot
     40 Saul, and Saul begot Jonathan, and Melchisue and Aminadab
     41 and Asabal ; and the son of Jonathan, was Meribaal and Me-
     42 ribaal begot Micha, and the sons of Micha, Phithon and Ma-
           lach and Tharach : and Achaz begot Jada, and Jada begot
     43 Galemith and Gazmoth and Zambri, and Zambri begot 3Iassa,
     44 and Massa begot Baana, and Raphaia was his son, and Elasa
           his son, and as for Esel his son, Esel had six sons, and their
           names were Ezrikam, his first born, and Ismael and Saraia
           and Abdia, and Anan and Asa.                              These were sons of Esel.
     X.          When the Philistines fought against Israel and the Israel-
           ites fled before them, and fell down slain on mount Gelbue,
           the Philistines pursued close after Saul and after his sons

              4 darts, and wounded him with arrows.                             Whereupon Saul said to
                  his armour bearer, Draw thy sword and run me through with
                  it, lest     the uncircumcised come and insult me.                                But his ar-

                  upon Saul took the sword and fell on it.                           And when his armour
              6 bearer saw that he was dead, he also fell on his sword.                                        Thus
              7 Saul died with his three sons that day.                                   And all his house
                  died together.            And when the Israelites who dwelt in the
                  plain, saw that Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were
                  dead they left their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and
                                                 7                            when           Philistines
              8 dwelt therein.             Now on the next day                         the                     came
                  to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen, on
              9 mount Gelbue.               And when they had stripped him, they took
                  his head and his armour, and sent them to the land of the
                  Philistines round about, to proclaim the good news to their
            10 idols, and to the people.                      And having deposited his armour
                  in the house of their god, they fixed up his head, in the house
            11 of Dagon.              But when all the inhabitants of Galaad heard all
            12 that the Philistines had done to Saul and Israel, all the va-
                  liant men of Galaad arose and took the body of Saul and the
                  bodies of his sons, and carried them to Jabis and buried their
            13 bones under the oak at Jabis, and fasted seven days.                                            Thus
                  died     Saul, for his transgressions,                     which he had committed
                  against God, according to the word of the Lord.                                   Because lie
            14 did not keep watchâ€”because Saul sought to consult by a belly
                  speaker, therefore Samuel the prophet answered him, though
                  he sought not the Lord, and the Lord slew him, and transfer-
                  red the kingdom to David, son of Jessai.
            XL           Then all Israel came to David to Chebron, and said,
              2 Behold we are thy bones and thy flesh.                                   Even in time past
                  when Saul was king, it was thou who didst lead us and bring
                  in Israel, and the Lord said to thee, Thou shalt feed my peo-
              3 pie Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over Israel.                                   So when all
                  the elders were come to the king at Chebron, king David
                  made a covenant with them at Chebron before the Lord, and
                  they anointed him to be king over Israel, according to the
                  word of the Lord by the ministry of Samuel.

                 . rebus,            the inhabitants of the land, the Jebusites who were
                 there said to David, Thou shalt not come here, yet he took
           5 the fortress Sion which is now the city of David.                                                                                               He indeed
           6 said, Whoever first smiteth the Jebusites, he shall be made
           7 chief and general of the army.                                                             Upon which Joab son of Saruia
           8 went up first and was made chief.                                                                  And David made his abode
                 in the fortress, for which cause he called it the city of David,
           9 and built the city around it.                                                         And David proceeded on advanc-
                 ing in greatness, for the Lord Almighty was with him.
        10                Now these are the chiefs of the mighty men who were with
                 David, who with him prevailed with all Israel during his reign,
                 that he should be, according to the word of the Lord, king
         11 over Israel.                             And this is the number of David's worthies.                                                                                 Je-
                 sebada son of Achaman, the first of thirty.                                                                           He drew his sword
                 once against three hundred men who were slain at one time.
        12 And after him Eleazar son of Dodai the Achochite, who was
         13 one of the three worthies.                                                       He was with David at Phasodamin
                 when the Philistines were assembled there for battle.                                                                                                        And
         1       there was a portion of a field full of barley.                                                                         And when the peo-
                 ple fled before the Philistines, he stood in the midst of the piece
                  of ground and maintained it and smote the Philistines, and the
         15 Lord gave a great victory.                                                            When three of the thirty chiefs
                  went down to the rock to David, to the cave Odollam, at the
                 time when the Philistines were encamped in the giant's vale,
         16 and David was in the fortress and there was a garrison of the
         17 Philistines at Bethlehem, David longed and said, O that some
                  one would give me some water to drink out of the well of Beth-
         18 lehem which is by the gate !                                                        Upon this the three broke through
                  the camp of the Philistines, and having drawn some water out
                  of the well of Bethlehem by the gate, they took it and came to
                  David.                But David would not drink it, but poured it out as a
                  libation to the Lord, and said, God forbid that I should do such
         19 a thing !                         Shall I drink the blood of these men who have jeo-
                 parded their lives ?                                    Because they had brought it at the hazard
         20 of their lives he would not drink it.                                                                          These things were done
                  by these three worthies.                                             And Abisa brother of Joab, who was
                  chief of the threeâ€”he drew his sword against three hundred
         21 who were slain at one time.                                                      He was renowned among the three.
                  Of the three he was higher in rank than two and was their
                                                                                                                               ;;

             22 chief, but did not come up to the three.                                      And Banaias son of
                   Jodae, son of a worthy, whose works for Kabasael were many
                   â€”he smote the two Ariels of Moab.                                   He went down also and
             23 smote a lion in the pit in a snowy day.                                        He smote also the
                   Egyptian, a noted man of five cubits high.                                              Though the
                   Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver's beam, Ba-
                   naias went against him with a staff, and wresting the spear out
                   of the hand of the Egyptian, he slew him with his own spear.
             24 These things Banaias son of Jodae did, and had a name among
             25 the three worthies.                    He was higher in rank than the thirty but
                   did not come up to the three, and David set him over his fa-

                   while he kept himself close because of Saul son of Kis ; and
               2 these among the worthies assisted in battle, and used the bow,
                   slung stones and hurled darts with both hands.                                           Of the bre-

        8 Iroam and who were Gedorites.                         And from the Gadites there
            withdrew to David from the wilderness, valiant men fit to com-
           mand an army in battle array, wielding shields and spears.
            Their faces were the face of a lion, and they were swift as roes
        9 on the mountainsâ€”Asa the chief, Abdia the second, Eliab
       10 the third, Masmana the fourth, Jeremias the fifth, Jethi the
      11 sixth, Eliab the seventh, Joanan the eighth, Eliazer the ninth,
      13 Jeremia the tenth, Melchabania the eleventh.                                     These from
       14 among the sons of Gad were officers of the army, the least of
           them commanded a hundred, and the greatest a thousand.
       15 These were they who crossed the Jordan in the first month,
            when it overflowed all its banks, and put to flight all the inka-
      16 bitants of the plains, from east to west.                         There came also some
      J 7  from Benjamin and Juda to the assistance of David.                                 And Da-
            vid went out to meet them, and said to them, If you are come to
            me with good intent, let my heart as it is disposed be knit to
           you : but if to betray me to my enemies, and not with sinceri-
      18 ty, may the God of our fathers see and rebuke.                                   Whereupon
           Amasai, a chief of the thirty, became inspired, and said, Ad-
           vance, David son of Jessai! for they are thy peopleâ€”Peace ! peace
           to thee ! and peace to them who assist thee, because thy God
           hath helped thee.              So David received them, and made them
      19 officers of the armies.                  There withdrew also to David some
           from Manasses, when the Philistines came against Saul to
           battle.      He indeed did not assist them, for in a council of war
           held by the generals of the Philistines, they said, With the
      20 heads of these men lie will return to his master Saul.                                  As Da-
           vid was returning to Sekelag there came to him from 31anasses,
           Edna and Josabath and Kodiel and Michael and Josabaith and
      21 Eliniuth and Semathi.                    They were the leaders of the thou-
           sands of Manasses, and they assisted David                                 in   the battle
           against the roving horde; for they were all men of valour, and
      22 for their valour commanders in the army.                                  For there came
           men daily to David to form a great army like the host of God.
                                                                                                                      ;

            28         Now these were the rolls of the chiefs of the army who
                 came to David to Chebron, to transfer the kingdom of Saul
           24 to him, according to the word of the Lord.                                      The children of
                 Juda armed with shields and spears, six thousand eight hun-
           25 dred, fit for the array of battle ; of the Symeonites fit for the
           26 array of battle, seven thousand one hundred; of the Levites,
                 four thousand six hundred, and Joadas the leader of the house
           27 of Aaron, and with him three thousand seven hundred, with
           28 Sadok a young man of valour, and of his patriarchal family
           29 twenty two chiefs ; and of the Benjaminites, Saul's brethren,
                 three thousand; but still the greater part of them kept the
           30 watch of Saul's house ; of the Ephraimites, twenty thousand
                 eight hundred valiant men, the most renowned in the houses
           31 of their respective families ; and of the half of the tribe of
                 Manasses, eighteen thousand, who were enrolled for the ex-
           32 press purpose of making David king ; and of the children of
                 Issachar, men who had knowledge suitable for the times, who
                 knew what Israel should do, two hundred chiefs, and all their
           33 brethren with them ; and from Zabulon there came ready for
                 battle, with all the implements of war with them, fifty thousand,
           34 to assist David effectually ; and from Nephthaleim, a thou-
                 sand chiefs, and with them thirty seven thousand, armed with
           35 shields and spears ; and from the Danites, twenty eight thou-
           36 sand eight hundred, marshalled for battle ; and from Aser they
           37 who go forth for battle, forty thousand ; and from beyond the
                 Jordanâ€”from Eeuben and Gad, and from the half of the tribe
                 of Manasses, with all the implements of war, a hundred and
           38 twenty thousand.                  All these warriors were arrayed for battle,
                 with a peaceable intention.                      They came to Chebron to make
                 David king over all Israel.                    And all the rest of Israel were of
           39 one mind that David should be king.                                   And they were three
           40 days eating and drinking.                        For their brethren made provision
                 for them.          And they who were nearest, as far as Zabulon and
                 Issachar and Nephthaleim brought provisions for them on ca-
                 mels and asses and mules and oxen, namely, flour, fig cakes,
                 dried grapes, wine and oil, with cattle and sheep in abundance
                 for there was joy in Israel.
           XIII.            When David had consulted with the captains of thou-
                 sands and captains of hundreds, under every leader, he said to
      Ch. XIV.                               I. CHKONICLES.
        2 the whole congregation of Israel, If it seemeth good and be
            countenanced by the Lord our God, let us send to the rest of
            our brethren who are left in all the land of Israel, and with them
            let the priests, the Levites in the cities of their possession be
        3 assembled with us ; and let us bring the ark of our God to us.
        4 For they had not sought it from the days of Saul.                                    Thereupon
            the whole congregation gave orders to do so ; for the proposal
        5 was right in the eyes of all the people.                         Accordingly, David as-
            sembled all Israel from the border of Egypt to the bay of
           Emath, to bring the ark of God from the city Iarim, and David
            brought it up.
        6        Now when all Israel came to the city Iarim which belong-
            ed to Juda, to bring up thence the ark of God the Lord, en-
            throned on cherubim whose name was invoked, they put the
        7 ark of God on a new cart.                     And from the house of Aminadab,
        8 Oza and his brothers guided the cart, while David and all Is-
            rael were playing with all their might before God, on psalte-
            ries and kinyras and nablas and tympanums and cymbals and
        9 trumpets.           But when they came to the threshing floor, Oza
            stretched forth his hand to take hold of the ark, because the
       10 bullock caused it to lean : whereupon the anger of the Lord
            was kindled against Oza, and he smote hirn there, because he
            stretched forth his hand upon the ark, and he died there be-
       J 1  fore God.         And David was disheartened because the Lord had
            made a breach on Oza, and called that place, Breach of Oza,
       12 which is still its name.                 And David was that day afraid of God
       13 and said, How can I bring the ark of God home to me? So Da-
            vid did not bring the ark of God home to himself, to the city of
            David, but caused it to turn aside to the house of Abeddara,
       14 the Gethite.            And the ark of God abode in the house of Abed-
            dara three months, and God blessed Abeddara and all that be-
            longed to him.
       XIV.           When Chiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David,
            with cedar timber, and masons and carpenters to build him a
         2 house, and David knew that the Lord had prepared him to be
            king over Israel ; for his kingdom was highly exalted for the
        3 sake of his people Israel, David took still more wives in Je-
            rusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him.
         4 Now these are the names of those who were born to him in
                                   I. CHEONICLES.
         Oh. XV.
             Jerusalem, Samaa,     Sobab,   Nathan and Solomon, and Baar
            and Elisa, and Eliphaleth and Nageth, and Naphath and Ja-
            phie, and Elisamae and Eliade, and Eliphala.
          8     When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king
            over all Israel, they all came up to seek David.           And when
          9 David heard it he went out to meet them.        Now the Philistines
         10 had come and spread themselves in the giant's vale.              And
            David inquired of God, saying, If I go up against the Philis-
            tines, wilt thou deliver them into my hands?          And the Lord
            said to him, Go up and I will deliver them into thy hands.
         11 So he went up to Baal Pharasin.         And when he had smitten
            them there David said, God broke through, my enemies by
            my hand, like the breaking out of water, therefore he called
         12 the name of that place, Breach of Pharasin.         And the Philis-
            tines having left their gods there, David ordered them to be
            burned.
         13     Again the Philistines came up and spread themselves again
         14 in the giant's vale.    And when David again inquired of God,
            God said to him, Thou shalt not go up after them.         Turn from
         15 them and come upon them near the pear trees.              And when
            thou shalt hear a sound of rustling in the tops of the pear
            trees, then thou shalt come to battle, for God is gone out be-
         16 fore thee to smite the camp of the Philistines.      Accordingly he
            did as the Lord commanded him, and he smote the camp of
         17 the Philistines from Gabaon to Gazera.        And the fame of Da-
            vid spread through all the land, and the Lord brought the dread
            of him on all the nations.
        NY.       When David had built houses for himself in the city of
            David, and prepared the place for the ark of God, and made
            for it a tabernacle : then David said, None but the Levites
            ought to carry the ark of God ; for the Lord hath chosen them
            to carry the ark of the Lord and to minister to him forever.
          3 So when David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring the
            ark of the Lord to the place which he had prepared for it, he
          4 assembled the sons of Aaron, the Levites; of the Kaathites,
          5 Uriel the chief and his brethren, a hundred and twenty ; of the
          6 Merarites, Asaia the chief and his brethren, two hundred and
          7 twenty ; of the Gersonites, Joel the chief and his brethren, a
          8 hundred and thirty ; of the sons of Elisaphat, Semei, the chief
         (  !h.        XV.                                                      I. CHKONICLES.
            9 and his brethren, two hundred ; of the sons of Chebron, Eliel
         10 the chief and his brethren, eighty ; of the sons of Oziel, Ainina-
         11 dab the chief and his brethren, a hundred and twelve.                                                                                                                                             And
                    David sent for Sadok, and Abiathar the priests, and for the
                   Levites, Uriel, Asaia and Joel, and Seruaia and Eliel, and
         12 Aniinadab, and said to them, You chiefs of the families of the
                   Levites, purify yourselves, both you and your brethren, that
                   you may carry up the ark of the God of Israel to the place
         13 which I have prepared for it ; for because you did not do this
                   on the former occasion, our God made a breach among us, be-
         14 cause we did not seek him with judgment.                                                                                                           So when the priests
                   and the Levites had purified themselves to carry the ark of
                    the God of Israel, the Levites took up the ark of God, as
          15 Moses had by the word of the Lord ordered in writing, with
          16 the staves on their shoulders.                                                                           NowDavidhad said to the chiefs
                    of the Levites, Appoint your brethren, such as play on musical
                    instruments, on nablas and kinyras, and cymbals, that they
          1  7 may make a loud sound with the voice of joy.                                                                                                              And the Levites
                    had appointed Aiman son of Joel and of his brethren, Asaph
                    son of Barachia, and of the sons of Merari his brethren, Aithan
          18 the son of Kisias and with them their brethren of the second
                    rank, Zacharias and Oziel, and Semiramoth and Jeiel, and
                    Elioel and Eliab, and Banaia and Maasaia, and Matthathia
                    and Eliphena, and Makellia and Abdedom, and Jeiel and
          19 Ozias, the keepers of the gates ; and the musicians Aiman,
                     Asaph and ilithan, sung and played on brass cymbals in the
          20 highest key ; and Zacharias and Oziel, Semiramoth, Jeiel ; Oni,
          21 Eliab, Maasias, Banias, on nablas in alaimoth ; and Mattathias
                     and Eliphalu, and Makenia and Abdedom, and Jeiel and Ozias,
          22 on kinyras in Amasenitli to give a strong sound.                                                                                                                         And Chono-
                     nias, a chief of the Levites, was master of the odes, for he was
          23 skilled therein.                                               And Barachia and Elkana were door keepers
           24 of the ark.                                        And Somnia and Josaphat, and Nathaniel and
                     Amasai, and Zacharia and Banaia, and Eliezer the priests,
                     sounded the trumpets before the ark of God.                                                                                                               And Abdedom
           25 and Jeia were door keepers of the ark of God.                                                                                                                             And David
                      with the elders of Israel and the captains of thousands, march-
                      ed before when they were bringing up the ark of the covenant
           26 from the house of Abdedom with joy.                                                                                                                And because God

             1                                                                          â€”
            Ch. XVI.                        J. CHRONICLES.
                 strengthened the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant
                 of the Lord, therefore they sacrificed each seven bulls and
            27 seven rams.         Now David was girded in a cotton stole, as were
                 all the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
                 and the musicians and Chonenias the chief of the singers.
            28 And when David in his cotton stole, and all Israel were bring-
                 ing up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting and
            29 the sound of clarions and trumpets, answered by nablas and
                 kinyras, it happened that when the ark of the covenant of the
                 Lord came to the city of David, Melchol the daughter of Saul
                 looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing,
                 and she despised him in her heart.
            XVI.         And when they had brought in the ark of God and set
                 it in the midst of the tabernacle, which David had erected for
                it,  they offered whole burnt offerings and offerings of thanks-
             2 giving before God.              And when David had finished offer-
                ing the whole burnt offerings and the offerings of thanksgiving,
             3 he blessed the people in the name of the Lord, and distributed
                to all Israel both men and women, to every one a loaf of ba-
             4 ker's bread, and a cake made with honey.                    Then he appointed
                some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the covenant
                of the Lord, and in responsive strains to thank and praise the
             5 Lord the God of Israel.             Asaph was the leader, and to him re-
                sponded Zacharias, Jeiel, Semiramoth and Jeiel, Matthathias,
                Eliab and Banaias, Abdedom and Jeiel, with musical instru-
                ments, nablas and kinyras ; but Asaph used the cymbal ; and
             6 Banaias and Oziel the priests, with trumpets, were to be con-
             7 tinually before the ark of the covenant of God.                      On that day
                David gave orders for beginning the praises of the Lord by
                the ministry of Asaph and his brethren, with this Ode :
             8       O give thanks to the Lord,
                     Invoke him by his name ;
                     Among peoples make known his designs.
             9       Sing to him.       Sing praises to him.
                     Proclaim to all the wonders which the Lord hath done.
            10       Sing praises to his holy name.
                     Let the heart which seeketh his favour be triad.
            1        Seek the Lord and persevere ;
                     Seek his face continually.

         I 2           Uemember the wonders which he hath done
                       The miracles and judgments of his mouth.
        13             The seed of Israel are his servants
                      The sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.
        14            He is the Lord our God
                      In all this land are his judgments.
        1             Let us ever remember his covenant
                      His word which he enjoined for a thousand generations.
        16            The covenant which he made with Abraham
                      And the oath which he sware to Isaak,
        17            This he confirmed for a law to Jacob
                      To Israel as an everlasting covenant,
        18            Saying, To thee I will give the land of Chanaan,
                      To be the portion of your inheritance.
        1             When they were very few in number ;
                      Of little account, and sojourned therein ;
        20            When they were passing from nation to nation
                      And from one kingdom to another people ;
       21             He suffered no man to oppress them
                      He rebuked kings for their sake
       22             Touch not these my anointed ones,
                      And to these my prophets do no harm.
       23                  Sing to the Lord, all ye of this land,
                      From day to day proclaim his salvation.

                      Above all the gods he is awful

               34                    praise the Lord ; for it is good,
                            For to everlasting his mercy endureth.
               35           And say, Save us,                      God of our salvation !
                            Gather us and deliver us from our enemies
                            That we may praise thy holy name,
                            And in thy praises make our boast.
               36              Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
                            From everlasting to everlasting,

              37            And when they had praised the Lord, they left there, be-
                     fore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, Asaph and his bre-
                     thren, that they might minister before the ark continually as
              38 each day's service required.                                     And with regard to Abcledom
                     and his brethren who were sixty eight, Abdedom son of Idi-
              39 thun and Osa were to be door keepers.                                                 And they left Sadok
                     the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle
                     of the Lord at the high place at Gabaon, that they might offer
              40 whole burnt offerings to the Lord, on the altar of whole burnt
                     offerings continually every morning and evening, according
                     to all that is written in the law of the Lord, which he enjoined
                     on the children of Israel by the ministry of Moses the servant
              41 of God : and with him were Aiman and Idithun, and the rest
                     who were chosen by name to praise the Lord, because his
              42 mercy endureth forever.                                And they had with them trumpets
                     and high sounding cymbals, and musical instruments, for the
              43 songs of God.                       And the sons of Idithun were to be keepers
                     of the gate.               Then all the people returned every one to his
                     home, and David returned to bless his household.
              XVII.                When David was settled in his house, he said to Na-
                    than the prophet, Behold I dwell in a house of cedar, but the
                    ark of the covenant of the Lord is beneath curtains of skin.
                2 Thereupon Nathan said to David, Do whatever is in thy heart
             1
                     XVII.                                              I. CHRONICLES.

            o for God is with thee.                                             But that very night there earne to Na-
            4 than a word of the Lord, Go, and say to David my servant,
                  Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell
            5 in.              Because I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought
                  up Israel even to this day, but have been in a tent and under
            I)    a curtain in all the places, through which J passed among Is-
                  rael, did I ever speak to any tribe of Israel, whom I command-
                  ed to feed my people, and say, Why have you not built for
            7 me a house of cedar?                                                 But now, Thus shalt thou say to my
                  servant David, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, I took thee from
            8 the foldâ€”from following the flocks, to be ruler over my peo-
                  ple Israel, and have been with thee wherever thou hast gone,
                  and have cut off all thy enemies from before thee, and made
                   thee a name like the name of the great men on the earth ; and
             (                                                                                       Israel, and plant them, and they
             J J will fix a place for my people
                  shall dwell by themselves and no more be in trouble, nor shall
          10 a son of iniquity any more humble them as at the first, even
                   from the time 1 appointed judges over my people Israel.                                                                                                             I
                   have indeed subdued all thy enemies, and I will increase thee
          1        and the Lord will build thee a house.                                                                    And when thy days are
                  fulfilled and thou shalt go to rest with thy fathers, I will raise
                  up thy seed after thee who shall proceed from thy loins, and I
          12 will prepare his kingdom.                                                      He shall build a house for me, and
         13 I will establish his throne forever.                                                               I will be to him a father and
                  he shall be to me a son ; and I will not withdraw my mercy
                  from him as I withdrew it from them who were before him ;
          14 but will confirm him in my house and in his kingdom, and his
                  throne shall be established forever.
          15               According to all these words and according to all this
          16 vision, so did Nathan speak to David.                                                                              Whereupon king Da-
                   vid went and sat down before the Lord, and said,
                           Who am I,                                Lord my God, and what is my house that
          17 thou shouldst love me forever!                                                               Though these were very small
                   before thee,                            my God, yet thou hast spoken of thy servant's
                   house for a great while to come, and hast looked upon me as
          1 S      with the eyes of a man, and exalted me.                                                                            Lord my God, what
                   more can David address to thee to express thy praise ?                                                                                                  Thou
          1!)      knowest thy servant, and according to thy own heart thou hast
          20 made all this greatness.                                                O Lord ! there is none like thee, nor is
         Ch. XVI II.               I. CHRONICLES.
             there a god besides thee according to all that we have heard with
             our ears ; nor is there another nation on the earth like thy people
         21 Israel.   How hath God led them to redeem a people for him-
             self, to make himself a name great and glorious, by driving out
             nations from before thy people whom thou didst redeem out
         22 of Egypt !     As thou hast made thy people Israel a people for
         2o thyself forever, and thou the Lord art become their God ; now
             therefore,    Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy
             servant, and touching his house be established forever, and do
         24 as thou hast spoken ; and let thy name be established and
             magnified forever by men, saying,            Lord, Lord Almighty,
             thou art the God of Israel, and the house of thy servant
         25 David is established before thee.        Because thou,        Lord my
             God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt
             build him a house ; therefore thy servant hath found freedom
         26 to make supplication before thee.        And now,       Lord, thou art
             God.   As thou hast spoken these good things, respecting thy
         27 servant ; now therefore begin to bless the house of thy servant
             that it may be before thee forever.      Because thou hast blessed,
             therefore bless it forever.
         XVIII.       Now after these things, David smote the Philistines
             and subdued them, and took out of their hands Geth and the vil-
          2 lages thereof.     He smote Moab also, and they became vassals
          3 to David and brought him gifts.          David also smote Adraazar
             king of Suba Emath.        As he was going to establish his domi-
          4 nion over the river Euphrates ; David intercepted a thousand
             of his chariots and seven thousand cavalry, and twenty thousand
             infantry.   And David destroyed all the chariots, reserving only
           5 a hundred of them.       And when the Syrians of Damascus came
             to assist Adraazar king of Suba, David smote of the Syrians
             twenty two thousand men.        And David garrisoned that part of
             Syria which belonged to Damascus, and the inhabitants became
             David's vassals, and brought him gifts.          And the Lord pre-
           7 served David wherever he went.          And David took the chains
             of gold which were on the servants of Adraazar, and brought
           8 them to Jerusalem.       And from Matabeth and from the chief
             cities which belonged to Adraazar, David took brass in great
             abundance, of which Solomon made the brasen sea and the pil-
           9 lars and the vessels of brass.     Now when Thoa king of Emath,
             XIX.                           I.  CHRONICLES.
      Ch.
            heard that David had sinitten all the army of Adraazar king of
      10 Suba, he sent his son Adurani to king David, to sue for peace
           with him, and to congratulate him because he had fought
           Adraazar and defeated him ; for Thoa was at war with Ad-
      11 raazar.          And all the vessels of gold and silver and brass,
           which he brought, these king David dedicated to the Lord,
           together with the silver and the 2:old which he took from all
           the nations from Idumea and Moab, and from the Ammon-
           ites and the Philistines and from Amelek.
      12         When Abessa son of Saruia had smitten of the Idumeans
      13 in the valley of salt, eighteen thousand, he put garrisons in the
           vale ;     and the Idumeans became David's vassals, and the
      14 Lord preserved David wherever he went.                                 And David reigned
           over all Israel, and continued to execute judgment and jus-
      15 tice among all the people.                       And Joab son of Saruia was over
      16 the army ; and Josaphat son of Achilud was recorder ; and Sa-
            dok son of Achitob and Achimelech son of Abiathar, were the
       17 priests; and Sousa was secretary; and Banaias son of Jodae
            was over the Cherethites and the Phelethites, and David's
            sons were next in rank to the king.
       XIX.           Now after these things, when Xaas king of the Ammon-
        ia  ites died and his son Anan reigned in his stead, David said, I
            will shew kindness to Anan son of Xaas as his father shewed
            kindness to me.             So David sent messengers to comfort him for
            his father.         But when David's servants came to the country of
            the Ammonites to Anan to comfort him, the chiefs of the Am-
         3 monites said to Anan, Is it to honour thy father in thy presence
            that David hath sent comforters to thee ? Is it not that they may
            examine the city and spy the country that his servants are come
         4 to thee?           Thereupon xlnan took David's servants and shaved
            them, and having cut off the half of their military robe even to
         5 the under garment, he dismissed them.                              And when messengers
             came to inform David respecting his servants, David sent to
             meet them, because they had been greatly dishonoured ; and
             the king said to them, Abide at Jericho till your beards grow
         6 and then return.               Xow when the Ammonites saw that David's
             people were dishonoured, Anan and the children of Ammon
             sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots
             and cavalry from Syrian Mesopotamia, and from Syrian Maa-
                1                                                                                                               ;

              Ch.
                7 cba and from Sobal.                    And they hired thirty two thousand of the
                    chariot army, and the king of Maacha and his people.                                                  And
                    when they arrived they encamped over against Medaba, and
                    the Ammonites were drawn together out of their cities, and
                8 came to commence war.                          When David heard this he sent Joab
                9 with all the army of the worthies.                               And the Ammonites came
                    out and drew up in array for battle before the gate of the city
                    but the kings who had come, encamped by themselves in the
              1     plain.       When Joab saw that they were arrayed for battle against
                    him both in front and rear, he made a draught out of all the youth
              1     of Israel and drew them up in array against the Syrians.                                              And
                    the rest of the people he put under the command of Abesai his
                    brother, and they were drawn up in array against the Ammon-
              12 ites.         And Joab said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, thou
                    must come to my assistance ; and if the children of Amnion
              13 prove too strong for thee I will support thee.                                       Be of good cou-
                    rage and let us act valiantly for our people and for the cities of
              14 our God, and the Lord will do what is good in his sight.                                                 And
                    when Joab and the people with him drew up in array for battle
              15 over against the Syrians they fled from them.                                        And soon as the
                    Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled they also fled before
                    Abesai and before Joab his brother, and entered the city.
                    Upon which Joab returned to Jerusalem.
              16          When the Syrian saw that Israel had defeated him, he des-
                    patched messengers and drew out the Syrians from beyond
                    the river.          And Sophath the general of Adraazar's army was at
              17 their head.               This being told David, he assembled all Israel and
                    crossed the Jordan and came upon them, and drew up for
                    battle against them.                  And while David was marshalling his ar-
                    my for battle against the Syrians, they attacked him ; but the
              18 Syrians fled before Israel, and David slew of the Syrians seven
                    thousand of the chariot army, and forty thousand infantry.
              19 He slew also Sophath the general of the army.                                           And when the
                    servants of Adraazar saw that they were defeated before Is-
                    rael, they made peace with David and served him.                                               And the
              XX.             Syrians would not help the Ammonites any more.                                              And
                    at the return of the year when kings take the field, Joab led
                    out all the strength of the army, and having laid waste all the
                    country of the Ammonites, he went and besieged Eabba

            while David abode at Jerusalem.                                  And when Joab had smitten
        2 Eabba and demolished it, David took the crown of Molchoni
            their king from his head, and the weight of it was found to be
            a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone and it was on the
        3 head of David.                    And having brought out the spoils of the city
            which were very great, he brought out the people who were in
            it, and put them to saws and iron mattocks and among quar-
            ry men.            And when David had done in this manner to all the
            Ammonites, he and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
        4          And after these things there was another battle at Gazer with
            the Philistines, in which Sobochai-sosathai smote Saphut a
        5 descendant of the giants and subdued him.                                                    There was also
            another battle with the Philistines, when Eleanan son of Jair
            smote Lachmai a brother of Goliath the Gethite, the staff of
        6 whose spear was like a weaver's beam.                                          There was also another
            battle at Geth, and there was a man of great stature there,
             who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, in
            all twenty four, and he also was a descendant of the giants, and
        7 he defied Israel ; but Jonathan son of Samaa, a brother of
        8 David, smote him.                          These were the descendants of Kapha at
             Geth.         They were all four giants, and they tell by the hand of
             David and by the hand of his servants.
      XXI.               Now when an adversary stood up in Israel and persuad-
             ed David to number Israel, and king David said to Joab and
        2 the chiefs of the army, Go, number Israel from Dan to Bersa-
        3 bee, and let me know the number of them, Joab replied, The
             Lord add to his people a hundred times as many as there are.
             and may the eyes of my lord the king see it.                                                   They are all
        4 servants to my lord.                        Whydoth mylord seek this ?                                 May it not
             be a cause of trespass to Israel ?                              But the king's determination
             prevailed against Joab, so he went forth, and having passed
         5 through all Israel, and come to Jerusalem, he gave David an
             account of the review of the people, and the whole number of
                      men of Israel who drew                                                   r
             the                                                          a sword, was eleven hundred
             thousand, and the children of Juda were four hundred and
         6 seventy thousand men who drew a sword.                                                      But he did not
             number Levi and Benjamin among them.                                                Because the king's
         7 word prevailed over Joab, and the thing was evil in the sight
             of God, therefore he smote Israel.

           8      When David said to God, I have sinned greatly in doing
              this, now therefore take away, I beseech thee, this wickedness
           9 of thy servant, for I have acted very foolishly, the Lord spoke
              to Gad, the seer, saying, Go, and speak to David, and say,
          10 Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three things, chuse for thy-
          1   self one of them that I may do it to thee.           So Gad went to Da-
          12 vid and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Chuse for thyself
              either three years of famine ; or three months to flee before
              thy enemies while the sword of thy enemies is destroying
              thee ; or the sword of the Lord and pestilence for three days
              throughout the land, while an angel of the Lord is making
              havock in all the inheritance of Israel.         Now therefore consider
          13 What answer shall I make to him who sent me?                      Thereupon
              David said to Gad, Very hard indeed to me are all the three.
              Let me however fall into the hands of the Lord, for his tender
              mercies are exceeding great.        But let me not fall into the hands
          14 of men.       So the Lord sent a pestilence through Israel, and
          15 there fell of the Israelites seventy thousand men.                And when
              God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, and he was mak-
              ing havock, the Lord looked and relented at the calamity, and
              said to the destroying angel, Let this suffice thee.               Stay thy
              hand.    Now the angel of the Lord was standing at the thresh-
          16 ing floor of Orna, the Jebusite.            And when David raised his
              eyes and saw the angel of the Lord standing between the earth
              and heaven, with a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over
              Jerusalem, he and all the elders being clad in sackcloth, fell on
          17 their faces, and David said to God, Was it not I who ordered
              the numbering of the people ?          I indeed am the sinner.        It is I
              who committed the sin.          But as for this flock, what have they
              done ?       Lord my God, Let thy hand be upon me, and on
              my father's house, and not on this thy people, O Lord, to de-
          18 struction.     Thereupon the angel of the Lord ordered Gad to
              tell David to go up and erect an altar to the Lord on the
          19 threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite.             So David went up ac-
              cording to the word which Gad spoke in the name of the Lord.
         20 And when Orna turned and saw the king and his four sons with
              him, with attendants (now Orna was threshing wheat) upon Da-
          21 vid's approach to Orna, Orna came out of his threshing floor and
          22 made obeisance to David with his face to the ground.                     And

        Ch.
             David said to Oriia, Grant me the place of this threshing iloor
             of thine, that I may build thereon an altar to the Lordâ€”grant
             it to me for its worth in money, that the plague may be stayed
       23 from the people. And Orna said to David, Take it for thyself; and
             let my Lord the king do what is good in his sight. Behold I have
             given these young bulls for a whole burnt offering, and that
             plough for wood, and this corn for a sacrifice.                               Of all these
       24 things I make a gift.                  And David said to Orna, By no means :
             for I must buy them for their worth in money.                                For I cannot
            take what are thine for the Lord, to offer a whole burnt offer-
       25 ing to the Lord at free cost.                    So David gave Orna for the place
       26 six hundred shekels of gold by weight.                          And having built there
            an altar to the Lord, he offered up the offerings of homage and
            thanksgiving, and cried to the Lord, and the Lord hearkened
            to him by fire from heaven upon the altar of the whole burnt
       27 offering, which consumed the whole burnt offering.                                   Then the
       28 Lord spoke to the angel and he sheathed his sword.                              When Darid
            saw that the Lord hearkened to him at the threshing floor of
       2!) Orna the Jebusite, and that he had sacrificed there at that
            time, though the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses had
            made in the wilderness, and the altar for whole burnt offerings
            were at that time at the high place of Gabaon (now he could
       30 not go before it to inquire of God, for that would not have
            been answerable to the haste in which he was, on account of
       XXII.          the sword of the angel of the Lord,) David said, This
            is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar for whole
            burnt offerings for Israel.
         2       Then David ordered the strangers in the land of Israel
            to   be assembled, and appointed stone cutters to cut hewn
         3 stones to build the house for God.                         He provided also iron in
            abundance for nails, for the doors and gates, and for hinges ; and
            brass in abundance, without weight, and cedar beams innumer-
         4 able ; for the Sidonians and Tyrians, brought for David, cedar
         5 timber in abundance.                  And David said, My son Solomon is
            young and tender, and the house to be built for the Lord is
            for extraordinary grandeur, for renown and glory, through
            every land, I will make provision for it.                           So David provided

                  8 it was in my mind to build a house for the name of the Lord God,
                       when there came to me a word from the Lord saying, Thou
                  9 hast shed much blood, and fought many battles, thou shalt
                       not build a house for my name, because thou hast shed much
                       blood on the earth before me.                                          Behold a son shall be born
                       to thee.             He shall be a man of rest.                                          I will give him rest
                       from all his enemies round about.                                                    For his name shall be
                       Solomon ; and I will give Israel peace and rest in his days.
                 1      He shall build a house for my name.                                                  And he shall be to me
                       a son ; and I will be to him a father.                                               And I will establish the
                11 throne of his kingdom in Israel forever.                                                           Now therefore, my
                       son, the Lord will be with thee, and will prosper thee, and
                       thou shalt build a house for the Lord thy God, as he hath
                 ]'2 spoken concerning thee.                                     Let but the Lord grant thee wisdom
                       and understanding, and strengthen thee over Israel, that thou
                 1      mayst keep and perform the law of the Lord thy God ; then
                        will he prosper thee, if thou be watchful to execute the sta-
                        tutes, and judgments, which the Lord enjoined on Israel by
                 14 Moses.                 Quit thyself like a man, and be strong.                                                   Fear not nor
                        be dismayed.                     Now behold according to my poor ability I have
                        provided for the house of the Lord a hundred talents of gold,
                        and ten hundred talents of silver, and brass and iron without
                 15 weight, because of their abundance.                                                        I     have also provided
                        timber and stones, but thou must add thereto.                                                                     And thou
                        must add to the number of workmen of whom there are with
                 1(5 thee artists, and masons and carpenters and men skilled in
                        every kind of work, of gold and silver and brass and iron, an

                 17 the Lord be with thee.                                     David also gave a charge to all the
                 18 chiefs of Israel to assist his son Solomon, saying, Hath not
                        the Lord been with you, and given you rest all around?                                                                          For

             ber of their names was polled to perform the works of the
             service of the house of the Lord, from twenty years old and
         25 upwards.    For David said, The Lord Cod of Israel hath given
         2(3 his people rest and fixed his abode in Jerusalem forever.       So
             the Levites not having to carry the tabernacle and all the uten-
         27 sils thereof for its service ; for this cause by these last orders
         28 of David, the Levites are numbered from twenty years old
            and upwards, for he set them under the superintendance of
             Aaron to serve in the house of the Lord, over the courts and
            over the store houses and over the purification of all the holy
         29 things, and over the work of the service of the house of God,
            and for the shew bread, and for the fine flour of the sacrifice
            and for the unleavened cakes, and for the frying pan, and the
            mixed sacrifice, and for all kinds of measuring, and to stand
         30 every morning to sing praises, and give thanks to the Lord,
         31 and the same every evening: and to have charge of all the
            offerings of homage made to the Lord, on the sabbaths and at
            the new moons, and at the festivals according to the number,
            and according to the rule prescribed for them, continually for
         32 the Lord.    And they are to keep the watch of the tabernacle
            of the testimony, and to guard the sanctuary, and to guard
            the sons of Aaron, their brethren, that they may minister as
            priests, in the house of the Lord.
         XXIV.       Now with regard to the sons of Aaron in the line of
          2 Nadab and of Abiud, and of Eleazar and of Ithamar.â€”As
            Nadab and Abiud died in the presence of their father and had
            no sons ; and . Eleazar and Ithamar had officiated as priests ;
          3 David classed Sadok at the head of the sons of Eleazar, and
            Achimelech at the head of the sons of Ithamar, according to
            the review of them according to their service, according to
          4 the houses oftheir families.   And as the Eleazarites were found
            to be more numerous for chiefs of mighty men than the sons
            of Ithamar, therefore he distributed themâ€”for the sons of
            Eleazar sixteen chiefs for houses of families, and for the sons
          5 of Ithamar chiefs for eight houses of families.   These he distri-
            buted by lot, one with the other.     Because there were chiefs of
            the holies, and chiefs of the Lord, among the sons of Eleazar
            and among the sons of Ithamar, therefore in the presence of the
                                                                                                              ;

      19 third for Adallai ; the twenty fourth for Maasai.                                 This was the
           review of them according to their service, to go into the house
           of the Lord according to the rule prescribed for them, under
           the inspection of Aaron their father, as the Lord God of Israel
           commanded Moses.

      27 to whom belonged the title Merarite ; his sons Isoam ; and
      28 Sakckur, and Abai ;                   for Mooli, Eleazar                and Ithamar, now
      29 Eleazar died and had no sons, for him Kis ; the sons of Kis,

              21 he would multiply Israel like the stars of heaven.                                                    When Joab

       and said, Hear me, my brethren and my people, I had it on my
       mind to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the
        Lord, and a place for the feet of our Lord, and had provided
     3 what were suitable for the building ; but God said, Thou
       shalt not build a house for me, to be called by my name ; for
     4 thou art a warrior and hast shed much blood.    Now the Lord
        God of Israel chose me in preference to all my father's house
        to be king over Israel forever,xis he chose the royalty in Ju-
        da, and my father's house out of the house of Juda and among
       the sons of my father, it was his pleasure that I should be king
     5 over all Israel ; so in preference to all my sons, for the Lord
        hath given me many sons, he hath made choice of my son So-
        lomon, to set him on the throne of the Lord's kingdom, over
        Israel. And God hath said to me, Thy son Solomon shall build
        my house, and my court ; for I have chosen him to be my son
     7 and I will be to him a father ; and I will establish his kingdom
        forever, provided he exert his power to keep my command-
     8 ments and my judgments as at this day.    Now therefore, in the
        presence of all the congregation of the Lord, and in the audi-
        ence of our God, I adjure you to keep and to seek all the com-
        mandments of the Lord our God, that you may possess this
        good land and leave it for an inheritance for your children
        after you forever.
      9    And now, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy fa-
        thers, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind
        for the Lord searcheth all hearts and knoweth every thought.
        If thou seek him, he will be found by thee ; but if thou forsake
     10 him, he will at last forsake thee.Observe now, since the Lord
        hath chosen thee to build a house for him for a sanctuary, be
        strong and do it.
     11    Then David gave his son Solomon the model of the tem-
        ple, and its houses and its treasuries, and of the upper chambers
        and the inner depositories, and of the house for the propitiation;
     12 and the plan which he had in his mind of the courts of the
        house of the Lord, and of all the chambers round about
                                                                            â€”;;
        Ch. XXIX.                I. CHRONICLES.
           those for store houses for the house of the Lord ; and of the
        13 depositories for the holy things, and the lodging rooms ; and
           of the daily courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the
           work of the service of the house of the Lord ; and of the depo-
           sitories for the vessels used in the service of the house of the
        14 Lord ; and the exact weight of these vessels, whether made
        15 of gold or of silver.   He gave him the weight of the candle-
        16 sticks and of the lamps.     He gave him likewise the weight of
           the tables for the shew breadâ€”of every table made of gold,
        17 and likewise of those to be made of silver; and of the flesh
           forks and the libation cups, and of the cups of goldâ€”the
           weight both of those to be made of gold and of those to be
           made of silver ; and of the censers, of each its several weight
        18 and pointed out to him the weight of the utensils of the altar
           of incense, which was to be of pure gold ; and the model of the
           chariot of the cherubims with expanded wings, which over-
        19 shadow the ark of the covenant of the Lord.       All these David
           gave to Solomon in a drawing of the hand of the Lord, accord-
           ing to the knowledge given him of the workmanship of the
        20 model.    Then David said to his son Solomon, Be strong and
            of good courage and do the work.     Fear not nor be dismayed
            for the Lord my God is with thee.     He will not leave thee nor
            forsake thee, till thou hast finished all the work for the service
            of the house of the Lord.   And behold this is the model of the
            temple, and of his house and his treasury, and the upper rooms
            and the inner depositories, and the house of the propitiation
        21 even the model of the house of the Lord.        And these are the
            courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the
            house of the Lord.    And there will be with thee for the work,
            every artist skilled in every art, and all the chiefs and all the
            people to execute all thy commands.
        XXIX.        Then king David said to all the congregation, My
            son Solomon whom the Lord hath chosen, is young and tender,
            and the work is great; for it is not for man but for the Lord
         2 God.    According to my utmost ability I have provided for the
            house of my God, gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, stones of
            Soam, and stones to be set, precious and variegated, every
            kind of precious stones, and Parian marble in abundance.
          3 Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my
     Ch. XXIX.                  I. CHRONICLES.
         God, the gold and silver which I kept for myself, behold this
         I have given for the house of my God, over and above what
      4 I provided for the house of the Holies ; three thousand talents
         of the gold of Souphir, and seven thousand talents of pure sil-
         ver, for overlaying therewith the walls of the sanctuary, the
         gold for that to be done with gold, and the silver for that
         to be done with silver, and for every work to be made by
      5 the hand of artists.     Xow let every one who is so inclined fill
         his hands this day for the Lord.
      6      Thereupon the chiefs of families, and the chiefs of the sons
         of Israel, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hun-
         dreds, and the overseers of the king's works and his builders,
      7 were liberally disposed, and gave for the works of the house of
         the Lord five thousand talents and ten thousand pieces of gold,
         and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents
      8 <>f brass, and a hundred thousand talents of iron.      And they who
         had precious stones gave them for the treasures of the house of
         the Lord which were under the care of Jeiel the Gersonite.
      9 And the people were rejoiced at this readiness, for with a per-
     10 feet heart they gave liberally to the Lord.      And David the king
         was exceedingly rejoiced, and blessed the Lord in the presence
         of the assembly, saying, Blessed art thou          Lord God of Is-
     11 rael, our Father, from everlasting to everlasting.         To thee,
         Lord, be ascribed greatness, and power, and exultation, and vic-
         tory, and majesty ; for thou hast dominion over all things in hea-
         ven and on earth.      At thy presence every king and nation is
     12 struck with awe.      From thee come riches and glory-        Thou,
         Lord, rulest over all.    Thou art the head of all dominion, and
         in thy hand is majesty and power.         And by thy hand,         Al-
     13 mighty Sovereign, all things are made great and strong.           Now
         therefore,    Lord, to thee we render thanks; and we praise thy
     14 glorious name.      But who am I, and what is my people, that we
         should be enabled to shew such liberality to thee. For all things
     15 are thine and of thine own we have given thee.          For we before
         thee are strangers and sojourners as all our fathers were.        Our
         days on earth are like a shadow and there is no fixed abiding.
     16     Lord our God, all this store which I have provided for
         building a house to thy holy name is from thy bounty, and be-
     17 longeth all to thee.    As I know, O Lord, that thou triest hearts
        Ch. XXIX.                  I. CHRONICLES.
            and lovest righteousness, I have with singleness of heart freely
            offered all these things, and have now seen with joy all thy peo-
         18 pie who are here present freely offering to thee.          Lord, the
            God of Abraham and Isaak and Israel our fathers, keep these
            things forever in the thoughts of the hearts of thy people and
         19 direct their hearts to thee, and give to my son Solomon a good
            heart to execute all thy commandments, and thy testimonies,
            and thy statutes, and that he may finish completely the struc-
            ture of thy house.
        20      Then David said to all the congregation, Bless ye the Lord
            our God.    And all the congregation blessed the Lord the God of
            their fathers, and with bended knees made a reverence to the
        21 Lord and to the king.      And on the morrow of the first day, when
            David had offered up whole burnt offerings to God, he sacrific-
            ed as thank offerings to the Lord a thousand young bulls, a thou-
            sand rams, a thousand lambs with their libations, and sacrifices
        22 in abundance for all Israel.     And having eaten and drunk that
            day with gladness before the Lord, they proclaimed Solomon
            son of David king a second time, and anointed him to be king
        23 for the Lord, and Sadok to be priest.        So Solomon sat on the
            throne of his father David and prospered, and all Israel obeyed
        24 him.    The chiefs, and the men in authority, and all the sons of
        25 king David his father were subject to him, and the Lord mag-
            nified Solomon over all Israel, and gave him royal glory, such
            as no king had before him.
        26      When David son of Jessai had reigned over Israel forty
        27 yearsâ€”seven years at Chebron and thirty three at Jerusalem,
        28 he died at a good old age, full of days, riches and glory.        And
            Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
        29      Xow the rest of the acts of David, the first and the last, are
            written among the words of Samuel the seer, and in the words
            of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Gad the seer, touch-
            ing all his reign, and his mighty power, and the times which
            happened to him, and to Israel, and to all the kingdoms of the
            land.
