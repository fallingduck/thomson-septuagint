### The
# Song of Solomon
## ΑΣΜΑ ΑΣΜΑΤΩΝ

#### Chapter 1

 **1** A Song of
Songs which is Solomons.

 **2** Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.
Because thy breasts are better than wine; **3** and the fragrance of thine
odours is above all perfumes--Thy name out-poured oil, therefore the virgins
have loved thee. **4** Thou art drawn: after thee we will run to the fragrance
of thy perfumes.

The king brought me into his inner apartment.

Let us rejoice
and be gladdened by thee. We will love thy breasts better than wine: rectitude
hath loved thee.

 **5** I am brown but comely, O daughters of Jerusalem; like
the tents of Kedar--like the curtains of Solomon. **6** Look not on me, because
I am of a dark complexion--Because the sun hath looked upon me. My mother's
children quarrelled with me--They made me a keeper in the vineyards. Mine own
vineyard I did not watch.

 **7** Tell me thou whom my soul loveth, where thou
tendest thy flock--Where thou causest it to rest at noon, perhaps I may be like
a wanderer among the tents of thy companions.

 **8** If thou wouldst not make
thyself known, O fairest of women; go out by thyself in the track of the flock;
and feed thy kids by the shepherds tents.

 **9** To that steed of mine in
Pharao's chariot I have compared thee, my love! **10** What! thy cheeks are
beautiful as a turtle dove's: and thy neck as strings of pearls. **11** We will
make for thee suitable figures of gold with spangles of silver.

 **12** While
the king was at his banquet, my spikenard sent forth its odour. **13** My dear
brother is to me a nosegay of stacte it shall be lodged in my bosom. **14** My
dear brother is to me a cluster of the cypress, in the vineyards of Engaddi.
**15** Behold thou art fair, my love; behold thou art fair. Thine eyes are
doves.

 **16** Behold thou art comely, my dear brother--beautiful indeed! Near
our bed thou wast shaded.

 **17** The beams of our houses are cedar. Cypress
our vaulted cielings.

#### Chapter 2

 **1** I am a flower of the field, and a
lilly of the vallies.

 **2** As a lilly among thorns, so is my consort among
the daughters.

 **3** As the citron tree among the trees of the forests; so is
my dear brother among the youths. In its shade I took great delight and sat,
and its fruit was sweet to my taste. **4** O conduct me to the house of wine,
and order for me what I love. **5** Strengthen with perfumes--strew around me
citrons, for I am wounded with love. **6** Let his left hand be under my head,
and his right embrace me!

 **7** I have adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
by the powers and virtues of the field, that you stir not up nor awake my love
till she please. **8** It is the voice of my dear brother! lo he cometh,
bounding over the mountains--skipping over the hills. My dear brother is like a
roe; or a young hart on the mountains of Baithor. **9** Lo! he is behind our
wall, looking in at the windows, taking a near view through the lattice. **10**
My dear brother addressing me saith, "Arise my love, my fair one, my dove! For
lo! the winter is past--the rain is over: is gone. **11** The flowers appear on
the earth--the pruning season is come. **12** The voice of the turtle is heard
in our land. **13** The fig tree hath put forth its green figs: the vines are
in bloom--they have shed a fragrance. **14** Arise, come my beloved, my fair
one, my dove. Yes, come thou dove of mine: in the shelter of the rock near the
wall. Shew me thy face and let me hear thy voice: for thy voice is sweet and
thy countenance comely."

 **15** Catch for us the little foxes, that spoil
vines: for our vines are in blossom. **16** My dear brother is mine and I am
his: he is feeding among the lillies. **17** Till the day blow fresh and the
shades be removed. Return--Be, O my dear brother, like a roe, or a young hart
on the caverned mountains.

#### Chapter 3

 **1** By night on my bed I sought
him whom my soul loved. I sought him but did not find him. I called him but he
made me no answer. **2** I will rise now and take a circuit in the city in the
places of publick resort and in the streets; and seek him whom my soul loveth.
I sought him but did not find him. **3** The watchmen who take their rounds in
the city, met me. Saw ye him whom my soul loveth? **4** It was but a little
while after I parted from them, till I found him whom my soul loveth. I took
hold of him and did not let him go till I brought him to my mother's house and
into the chambers of her who conceived me. **5** I charged you, O daughters of
Jerusalem by the powers and virtues of the field, not to stir up nor awake my
love till he please.

 **6** What is this coming up from the wilderness; like a
column of smoke, fuming with myrrh and incense made of all the perfumer's
powders?

 **7** It is the palanquin of Solomon, three score chiefs of the
chiefs of Israel are around it. **8** All swordsmen expert in war. Every man
with his sword on his thigh, for fear of danger by night. **9** King Solomon
had made himself a palanquin of the wood of Libanus. **10** Its columns he made
of silver, and his sofa was of gold. Its canopy was purple, and its inside
carpeted with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.

 **11** O daughter of Sion
go forth and view king Solomon; in the crown with which his mother crowned him;
on the day of his espousals--Even on the day of the gladness of his heart.
#### Chapter 4

 **1** Behold, thou art fair, my love! Behold thou art fair!
Thine eyes are doves, now thy veil is removed! thy hair is like the flocks of
goats which are seen from mount Gralaad: **2** thy teeth like the flocks of
shorn sheep; which have just come up from the washing pool: they are all twins
and there is not one defective among them. **3** Thy lips are like a braid of
scarlet and thy speech is graceful: as the skin of a pomegranate, so are thy
cheeks, now thy veil is removed. **4** Thy neck is like the tower of David,
which was built for an armoury: on it are hung a thousand shields; all the
javelins of the worthies. **5** Thy two breasts are like two twin fawns of a
roe; which are browzing among lillies. **6** Till the day breeze spring up and
the shades are removed, I will go by myself to the mountain of myrrh, and to
the hill of frankincense. **7** Thou art altogether fair, my love and there is
no blemish in thee.

 **8** Come from Libanus, my spouse; come from Libanus.
Thou canst come, yes come safely from the top of Pistis--from the summit of
Sanir and Herinon--from lions dens, from the leopards mountains. **9** Thou
hast ravished my heart, my sister spouse: thou hast ravished my heart with a
glance of thine eyes--with an endearing turn of thy neck. **10** How beautiful
are thy breasts, my sister spouse! how much more pleasing than wine are thy
breasts! and the smell of thy garments, than all spices! **11** thy lips, my
spouse, drop as a honey comb: honey and milk flow from thy tongue: and the
fragrance of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. **12** Thou art an
enclosed garden, my sister spouse: a close shut garden; a sealed fountain.
**13** Thy productions are a paradise of pomegranates with delicious fruits;
aromatic plants with the varieties of balsams--spikenard and saffron, sweet
cane and cinnamon; **14** with all kinds of trees of incense--myrrh, aloth with
all the principal spices. **15** A garden fountain and a well of living water,
flowing with gentle murmurs from Libanus.

 **16** Awake O north wind, come
also, O south wind and blow gently through my garden, and let my aromatic
spices flow. Let my dear brother come down to his garden; and taste the
delicious fruits thereof.

#### Chapter 5

 **1** I have come to my garden, my
sister spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spices: I have eaten my bread
with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink--yes
drink plentifully O brethren. **2** I sleep; but my heart is awake. The voice
of my dear brother! he knocketh at the door! "Open to me, my sister, my dove,
my consecrated one! for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops
of the night." **3** I have put off my garment; how can I put it on? I have
washed my feet; how can I defile them? **4** My dear brother withdrew his hand
from the hole in the door. Whereupon my bowels yearned for him. **5** I rose to
open for my dear brother; my hands dropped myrrh; and my fingers myrrh
plenteously on the handles of the bar. **6** I opened for my dear brother. He
was gone! my soul melted for the speech of him. I sought him but did not find
him: I called him but he made me no answer. **7** They who go the rounds in the
city met me. They smote me--they wounded me. The keepers of the walls took my
veil from me. **8** I adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem by the powers and
virtues of the field. If you found my dear brother--What should you tell him?
Tell him that I am sick of love.

 **9** "What is thy dear brother more than
another brother, O fairest of women? What is thy dear brother more than another
brother, that thou hast thus adjured us?" **10** My dear brother is white and
ruddy, he is the chiefest among tens of thousands. **11** His head is gold of
Kephas; his flowing locks black as a raven. **12** His eyes are like doves by
streams of water--milk white doves sitting by streams. **13** His cheeks are
like beds of spices emitting perfumes; his lips are lillies distilling myrrh
plenteously. **14** His hands are of gold, finely turned, beset with
chrysolites: his body, an ivory cabinet on a sapphire stone: **15** his legs,
pillars of marble fixed on pedestals of gold: his countenance like Libanus,
majestic as the cedars his mouth is sweetness itself. **16** He is altogether
lovely. Such is my dear brother, and such my love, O daughters of Jerusalem.
#### Chapter 6

 **1** "Where did thy dear brother go, O fairest of women?
Whither did thy dear brother bend his course; that we may seek him with thee?"
**2** My dear brother went down to his garden to the beds of spices; to feed in
the garden and to gather lillies. **3** I am my dear brother's and he is mine;
he is feeding among the lillies!

 **4** Thou my consort, art beautiful as
Terzah; comely as Jerusalem; dazzling as embattled hosts! **5** Turn thine eyes
aside from me for they have transported me. Thy hair is like a flock of goats
which are seen on mount Galaad: **6** thy teeth like flocks of shorn sheep,
just come up from washing: all twins and there is not one defective among them:
thy lips are like a braid of scarlet, and thy speech is graceful. **7** Thy
cheek is like the downy skin of a pomegranate now thy veil is removed. **8**
There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number: one
is my dove, my consecrated one. **9** One is her mother's only child--the
darling of her who bore her. Daughters viewed her--nay queens and even
concubines will hail her happy and thus extoll her. **10** "Who is she that is
looking out like the morning; fair as the moon, distinguishable as the sun, and
dazzling as embattled hosts."

 **11** I went down to the garden of nuts to
look at the productions of the valley: to seek whether the vine had budded or
the pomegranate blossomed: **12** I am there to grant thee my breasts. My soul
did not recollect this. It made me like the chariots of Aminadab.

 **13**
Return, return, O Sunamite! return, return that we may see thee! What would you
see in the Sunamite, who is coming like the moving bands of an army?

####
Chapter 7

 **1** How beautiful were thy steps in thy sandals, daughter of
Nadab? The infoldings of thy loins are like jewellery, the work of an artist:
**2** thy clasp is a well turned goblet, not destitute of mingled wine: thy
body is like a heap of wheat encompassed about with lillies: **3** thy two
breasts are like two twin fawns of a roe; thy neck is like a tower of ivory.
**4** Thine eyes like the pools at Esebon by the gates of the daughter of many:
thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looketh towards Damascus: **5** thy
head is like Carmel and the tresses of thy head like Purpura. The king is
detained in the antichamber

 **6** How beautiful thou art! and how sweet! O my
love! how delightful! **7** In respect to thy stateliness, thou hast been
compared to the palm tree, and thy breasts to its clusters. **8** I said, I
will climb the palm tree--I will clasp its topmost boughs; and thy breasts
shall be now like the clusters of the vine; and the smell of thy nose like
citrons; and the roof of thy mouth like choice wine--

 **9** Which is poured
out rightly for my dear brother properly adapted with my lips and my teeth.
**10** I am my dear brother's and towards me is his desire. **11** Come, my
dear brother, let us go out to the fields. **12** Let us lodge in the villages:
let us get up early to the vineyards: let us see whether the vine is budded:
whether the young grape has made its appearance: whether the pomegranates are
in blossom. There I will grant thee my breasts. **13** The mandrakes have shed
a fragrance: and in our hoards are all manner of delicious fruits, newly
gathered as well as old. For thee, my dear brother I have kept them.

####
Chapter 8

 **1** O that thou, my dear brother, hadst sucked the breasts of my
mother; meeting thee abroad I could kiss thee and not be despised; **2** I
could take thee and conduct thee to my mother's house: and to the inmost
apartment of her who conceived me, I could cause thee to drink spiced wine of
the juice of my pomegranates; **3** his left hand might be under my head and
his right embrace me.

 **4** I have charged you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by
the powers and virtues of the field; that you stir not up nor awake my love
till she please.

 **5** Who is this coming up cloathed in white leaning on her
beloved? Under a citron tree I awaked thee. It was there thy mother bare thee.
There she who brought thee forth suffered the pangs of childbirth.

 **6** O
set me as a seal on thy heart--as a seal on thine arm: for love is strong as
death; jealousy inflexible as Hades: its wings are wings of fire its flames--
**7** Much water cannot quench love; nor can floods drown it. Though a man give
all his substance for love, he may be thoroughly despised.

 **8** Our sister
is little and hath no breasts. What can we do for our sister on the day when
she shall be demanded in marriage. **9** If she be a wall we will build on her
silver turrets, and if she be a door we will line her with boards of cedar.
**10** I am a wall and my breasts are turrets. I was in their view as one who
had found favour. **11** Solomon had a vineyard at Beelamon, he let this
vineyard of his to tenants, a man is to give him a thousand pieces of silver
for its fruit. **12** My vineyard which is before me shall continue to be mine.
Solomon shall have the thousand pieces of silver, and they who take care of its
fruits, two hundred.

 **13** Thou who art sitting in the gardens, companions
are waiting thy voice. Let me hear it--

 **14** Away, my dear brother, and be
like a roe; or a young hart on the mountains of spices.
