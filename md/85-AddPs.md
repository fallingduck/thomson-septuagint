# Psalm 151
## ΨΑΛΜΟΣ ΡΝΑ

#### Chapter 1

*There is in the Septuagint another Psalm, with this title:—This Psalm on David was written by himself in prose, when he fought in single combat with Goliath.*

 **1** I was little among my brethren, and the youngest of my father's family. I fed my father's flocks. **2** My hands had made an organ; and my fingers had tuned a psaltery. **3** But who will tell my Lord. My Lord himself heareth. **4** He sent his messenger and took me from my father's flocks and anointed me with anointing oil. **5** My brothers were comely and great; but the Lord did not delight in them. **6** I went out to meet the Philistine, and he cursed me by his idols. **7** But I drew his own sword and cut off his head, and took away reproach from the children of Israel.
